1. Stop! 2. Drop! 3. Roll!
Roll! Roll! Roll!
If your clothes start to burn, don’t panic! Drop to the floor. Roll around until the fire is out.
Never go back into a burning house. Stay out once you are out. Always call 9-1-1 if you smell smoke or if there is a fire. The fire department will help.

"Have you ever wanted to know how paper is made? Paper is often made with machines in big mills. But you can make your own paper at home or school. You just need a few supplies and some help from an adult.
The first step to making paper is to find old paper. Rip the paper into small pieces. Rip enough paper to fill one cup.
Second, put all the paper pieces in a blender. Pour three cups of warm water into the blender. Blend the paper and water on high for ten seconds.
The paper and water will turn into pulp. The pulp should look like thick soup.
Add more water if the pulp is as thick as oatmeal. Add more paper if the pulp is as thin as water.
Third, bend the wire hanger into a rectangle. Cut off one leg of the pantyhose. Put the hanger inside the leg. This is the frame for your paper.
Fourth, pour the pulp into the flat pan. Slide the frame into the pan. Move the frame around until the pulp evenly covers it.
Slowly lift the frame out of the pan. Hold it flat above the pan. Let the extra water drip into the pan.
Fifth, place ten sheets of newspaper on a flat table. Place two pieces of felt on top of the newspaper. Lay the frame with the pulp side up on the felt.

“For a full year, the Earth has to spin a little bit more,” the librarian explained. “To do that, the Earth needs an extra six hours every year,” she said. “Every four years, that adds up to one extra day,” she added.

"Once, many years ago, all the birds of the world met together. They had a problem. It all started when foxes began to chase robins. Foxes normally chased chickens.
One day, a fox followed the tracks of a chicken. Or so it thought. The tracks really belonged to a robin. At that time, all the birds had the same tracks!
Chickens knew to run from foxes. Robins did not. So the fox easily chased the robins. The robins were tired of being chased.
All the birds met. They wanted to protect robins from foxes. They needed a plan. Owl asked, “What can be done?”
Woodpecker said, “Let robins fly all the time. Or make them stay in the trees.”
Crow did not like this plan. He knew that robins ate worms from the dirt. “Robins must walk on the ground,” he said.
Hummingbird said, “Let robins eat from flowers.” “That won’t work either,” said Sparrow. “Robins don’t have the proper beaks.”
The birds thought. They talked, and they thought some more.
Finally, Owl said, “Let robins hop on both feet.”
“Robins’ tracks will not look like chickens’ tracks if they hop,” Owl said.
“Good, good!” cried all the birds. They flapped their wings with joy.
Chickens would walk with one foot after the other. Robins would hop. Foxes would not get confused.
Owl was glad she could help the robins. Now, she could sleep.
From that day on, foxes only chased chickens. Robins could search the dirt for worms in peace.",524.0

"What Is a Pocket Park?
Some cities don’t have space for big, grassy parks. That’s why they build pocket parks instead.
A pocket park is like a regular park, only smaller. A pocket park can take up a city block. It can also be as small as a parking space.
An empty lot is a great place for a pocket park. It can take many workers to build one.
People who live close by can help, too. They can plant flowers or trees. They can also help keep the park clean and safe. Every pocket park is different.
This pocket park has a waterfall at the back. It also has many places for people to sit.
Check out the colorful art at this pocket park. It has a swing to play on, too.
People decorated this pocket park with many lights. They twinkle at night.
An artist made a statue for this pocket park. It reminds people of someone important.
This pocket park has grass and a large pond. People can come here to think.

"Ships and boats carry people and goods over water. Ships and boats were once the fastest way to move things.
The first boats were made out of logs. People used poles to push the boats.
Other boats used paddles or oars. The oars pushed against the water to move the boats.
Later, people made boats with wooden frames. They covered the frames with bark or animal skins.
Frame boats were larger than log boats. Many people could row at the same time.
Sails were used to move boats, too. The sails caught the wind to push the boat.
Larger ships needed more sails. Sailing ships carried people around the world.
Many ships and boats today are made of metal or plastic. They often use motors to move through the water.
People still use smaller boats for fishing and fun. Many small boats still use paddles or oars.
Many countries use ships and boats to defend their coasts. Ships and boats are still an important part of our world.",497.0

The goat ran for his life, but the wolf soon caught him.
The hungry wolf licked his lips. He opened his jaws to eat the goat.
“Wait!” cried the goat before the wolf could gobble him up. “Do me one favor before you eat me!” he begged.
“What favor is that?” asked the wolf. “It’s a small thing, really,” said the goat.
“I want to hear music once more in my life,” said the goat. “Would you please sing me a song before you eat me?” he asked.
The wolf thought for a moment. “Why not?” he laughed. “I can still eat you when I am done singing,” the wolf growled.
So the wolf began to howl out a song for the goat. His mighty voice was loud and strong.

" They go over bays and swamps. They go over highways and railroads. Some even float.
Bridges are long and short. They can be high above the water. They can be near the water. They can carry cars, trucks, trains, and buses. Some carry people. Some carry water or oil.
The first bridges were made out of wood, rope, or stone. Today, most bridges are made of steel and concrete.
The first bridges were simple. Some were just logs placed across a stream. Some were ropes stretched across a river.
Later, stones were used to build stronger and longer bridges. In time, people were building bridges like the ones we see today. These are made of concrete and steel. They go across longer distances.
There are names for different types of bridges. This table shows some of the types.
Building bridges is a big job. It can take many years. It can cost millions of dollars. It can take many workers to build a bridge. Let’s look at a bridge being built over a river.
First, workers must build supports under the water. They hammer large steel tubes into the river bottom. The tubes, called piles, are filled with concrete.
Next, workers put supports across the piles. The supports are built under water using a special dam. A dam holds the water back. The workers can work where it is dry.
Next, workers build piers. They are like the legs on a table. They will hold up the bridge.
Then caps are put on the tops of the piers. Concrete pieces, called girders, are put between two piers. The girders hold up the roadway.
Steel bars are placed between the girders. The steel bars make the concrete stronger. Concrete is poured over the steel bars. The concrete gets hard. Finally, the new bridge is ready for traffic.",469.0
"I smile. I frown. I look surprised.
What do the looks on my face share? Muscles! My face has forty-two muscles.
Three kinds of muscles help my body move in different ways.
The first kind of muscle is skeletal muscle. This kind of muscle is mostly connected to my bones.
My body has more than six hundred skeletal muscles in all.
Skeletal muscle helps me to grip, swing, or jump.
My bones and muscles work together with my brain to help me move. My brain sends a message to my muscles to write, bike, or type.
My muscles then pull on my bones to move different parts of my body. My muscles sometimes pull on my skin, like in my face, instead of my bones.
A second kind of muscle is smooth muscle . Smooth muscle helps move things, such as food or drinks, through my body. This kind of muscle does its job without me thinking about it.
A third kind of muscle is cardiac muscle. Cardiac muscle helps my heart pump blood. My cardiac muscle works all the time and does not rest.
How do I know when my muscles are working? I can feel my heart beat to know my cardiac muscle is working.
I know my smooth muscles are working when I have to go to the bathroom. I can see my skeletal muscles working anytime I move.
So what happens when someone asks me to show my muscles? I ask, “Which kind?”",499.0

" Glucose goes into our blood. It is a source of energy for the body.
The body can get all the glucose it needs from naturally sweet foods. Many store foods, though, have extra sugar.
Pasta sauce and ketchup often have added sugar. Tomatoes can taste bitter when they are cooked. Sugar is added to get rid of the bad taste. Many low-fat foods have sugar. Oils and fats give food flavor. Without them, the food doesn’t taste as good. Sugar is added to make these foods tasty.
Breakfast cereal has sugar, too. Many cereals have sugary treats added. Even cereals with plain flakes may have added sugar.
If sugar gives us energy, how can too much sugar be bad? The body cannot just get rid of sugar it does not use. Instead, it changes the sugar to fat. The fat is stored for later.
A body that has too much fat can have problems. The heart must work harder to pump blood. Muscles and bones strain to move extra weight. Too much glucose in the blood can be bad, too. It can make it hard for some parts of the body to work right. Do You Know?
People can avoid problems by not eating added sugar. They can eat more natural food. Sweet fruits have no added sugars.
They can eat more homemade meals. Cooking at home lets them control what goes into food they eat.
People can read food labels. Most labels have a list of ingredients. The ingredients are listed in order by the amount in the food. If sugar is near the top of the list, the food has a lot of it.

"Many places have cold winters. Some animals in these places have trouble finding food in the winter. Many animals move to warmer places to find food. Other animals hibernate.
What Is Hibernating?
Hibernating is like a very sound sleep. Hibernating animals sleep for many days or weeks at a time. Animals breathe slowly when they hibernate. Their hearts beat slower, and they do not need to eat.
How Do They Stay Alive?
Hibernating animals eat lots of food before winter begins. They store the food in their bodies as fat. Their bodies live off this fat while they sleep.
They also need a safe place to sleep. They need to be safe from the cold. And they need to be safe from predators that want to eat them.
Some animals, like bats, hibernate in caves. Hibernating snakes sleep underground in burrows. Frogs and turtles sleep in mud at the bottom of ponds.

My lungs trade oxygen for carbon dioxide through the tiny balloons.
Carbon dioxide is waste air. My body doesn’t need carbon dioxide. My body sends carbon dioxide to my lungs in my blood.

"Long ago in China, people were afraid of Nian, the dragon beast.
Nian had a sharp horn and a huge mouth. He could eat five people in one big bite! Glump!
All year long, Nian slept deep in the ocean. By the end of winter, he was very hungry.
Each year, just before the Chinese New Year, Nian would climb out of the ocean.
He would look for people to eat. Nian liked to eat children best. People would run away and hide in a cave.
One New Year’s Eve, a very old man came. He said he could scare away the beast.
No one believed him so they hid in the cave. That night, people heard boom, bang, and clang. They heard Nian roar.
On New Year’s morning, the old man was gone. Nian was gone, too—and he never came back again.
The old man had left a bag for them. Inside, they found red shirts, firecrackers, tin pans, and sticks. Nian was afraid of noise and the color red!
Now, on New Year’s Eve, people know how to keep Nian away. They wear bright red, light firecrackers, and make noise all night long!",515.0

“We need to get him down before our yard sale starts,” he said.
“We could call off the sale,” Mrs. Miller said. “We just need to brainstorm a way to get him down,” said Sam.
“We could move our trampoline under the tree,” Sam’s little sister Sarah said.
“Draw the idea,” said Mrs. Miller to Sam. Sam drew the idea on his pad of paper.
He drew the bear bouncing up into the air. “I don’t think that will work,” he said.
“Mom, what would you do?” Sarah asked. “I’d play some really bad music,” Mrs. Miller laughed.
Sam drew the idea on his pad of paper. He drew the bear climbing up the tree to get away from the noise.
“That might make things worse,” Sam sighed. “Look, the bear’s eating nuts up there,” Sarah said.
“I’ve got it!” Sam shouted. “We can make a trail of nuts leading back to the forest,” he said.

"Golf is a quiet and fun sport. Players must be calm to play well. They must practice to be good.
Players hit a small, hard ball with a club. They hit the ball into a small hole in the ground. The player who gets the ball in the hole with the fewest hits wins.
Players hit the ball hard to try to move it to the green. They may need several hits to get it there.
A golf course may have parts with rough grass. The golf course may also have sand or water traps. A player may need more hits to get a ball out of these places.
Some clubs are good for hitting the ball far away. Others are good for shorter shots.
Each hole of a golf course has a starting place at one end. The green with the small hole is at the other end. A golf course has nine or eighteen holes.
Golf began hundreds of years ago. The first golf balls were made of wood. Now, golf balls are made of rubber and plastic.
Many people around the world love to play golf. The sport is popular in countries where people speak English.

Two big, dark birds flew up from the tall grass. They flew into the lowest branches of the trees and sat. Tom saw pale blue heads looking at him.

Summer is playtime. For the leaves of many trees, however, it’s work, work, work! The Sun is shining. The leaves are making food for the trees. The trees store any extra food deep inside. The stored food will help them get through winter.
Leaves are green in summer because they are making food. or brown colors inside them. During summer, those other colors are hidden by the green color.
Many places get colder in fall. The days get shorter, and the nights get longer. Trees get less sunlight, so photosynthesis slows down.
Over time, leaves stop making the green chemical, so they lose their green color. When that happens, the hidden orange, yellow, and brown colors start to show. Leaves also start making a red color at this time.
Once it gets cold enough to freeze at night, the trees drop their leaves. They do this to keep themselves safe. If the leaves freeze while still on the trees, the trees can be hurt.
Trees that drop their leaves are bare in winter. They use the stored food to get through the cold days and colder nights.
Spring comes before long. Ice and snow melt, and the rains come. The Sun shines, and tiny leaves grow from branches.
Once again, the leaves use sunlight, water, and air to make food. The cycle begins again.",527.0

“I think we have been in the rain too long,” said Grandpa Grizzly. “We should go in the tent before you all catch colds.” “But I want to fish some more,” said Snubby Nose. “You can cast one more time,” said Grandpa Grizzly. Snubby Nose cast as far as he could. But he cast so hard that he fell right into the water!
“Help me!” cried Snubby Nose. “I can’t swim!” Grandpa Grizzly jumped into the river and pulled Snubby Nose up. Then he carried Snubby Nose to shore and wrapped a towel around him.
“Oh no, my fishing pole is still in the water!” cried Snubby Nose. Grandpa Grizzly leapt bravely back into the chilly river. He found Snubby Nose’s pole on the muddy bottom. Then he handed it to Snubby Nose before getting out of the water.
“My hook is caught on something,” said Snubby Nose. “Something is pulling on the line,” said Speedy Legs. “It’s wriggling around,” said Fluffy “It’s bending your pole!” said Floppy “You’ve caught a fish, Snubby Nose!” said Grandpa Grizzly. “Reel it in.”
Snubby Nose pulled on the pole and reeled the line in. The fish was so strong, all the Hoppers had to help him pull. Finally, they caught the biggest fish they had ever seen. “Let’s go into our tent and have a fish dinner,” said Grandpa Grizzly. All the Hoppers went into the tent, dried off, and ate a fresh fish dinner. They went camping and fished for five days. And Grandpa Grizzly was the only one who caught a cold.",522.0

Over the next few days, I filled the basket with lots of things: a picture of me, a letter, a drawing I made. All of these things were important for me to share. But I still felt like there was something missing from the basket. At bedtime, Mommy tucked me into bed. She read me a story. She gave me a big hug good night. That’s when I knew what was missing. “Mommy,” I said, “Daddy and I used to read stories at bedtime. We used to give each other a big hug good night. Who reads stories to Daddy now? Who gives him his bedtime hug?” Mommy gave me another hug. “I wish I could send him a good night hug,” I said.
The next morning when I woke up, I saw a big piece of paper on the kitchen floor. I saw markers and crayons. “I know how you can send a hug to Daddy,” Mommy said. “If you lie on this piece of paper, I can make a tracing of your body. We will cut it out, and you can decorate it to look like you. If we send this to Daddy, he can wrap the arms around himself each night. It will be as if you are giving him a hug good night.” I lay down, and Mommy traced around me with a marker. I filled in all the white space to make it look like me. I folded it neatly and placed it in the box with the other items to send to Daddy.
Two weeks later, we got a letter back from Daddy. Most of the letter was written to Mommy. But at the end of the letter, there was a special note just for me:

During the last inning of our first game, I signaled for a fastball. The batter hit a pop fly. The ball sailed toward the sun like a rocket ship. “Catch it, Eggy!” the coach shouted.
I flung off my mask. Even with the sun in my eyes, I nabbed the pop-up. My team won the game! I told Jordan about my awesome catch. “Pop-ups are easy outs, Eggy,” he said. “Try something harder next time.”
We lost the next game, but I tagged a player out as she slid home. Later, when I told Jordan, he tossed his dinner napkin at me. “Not bad, Eggy,” he said. “This Saturday I’ll watch you play.”
On Saturday, I tried to forget that Jordan was there. The other team was playing very well. I did not want to lose another game. The score was tied in the last inning.

That’s when the ball hit my head. I fell to my knees. Before I blacked out, my mitt reached for the ball.
When I opened my eyes, Jordan was kneeling next to me. He held an ice pack to my head. Both teams clapped loudly as Jordan walked me to the bench. “Did I catch it?” I asked. The coach handed me my mitt. There, right in the middle, was the ball.

" Then I took my nap so Goose could lay more eggs. Suddenly, I woke to that human smell. I saw a boy grab Goose and tiptoe away. I shouted and chased them.
The boy jumped onto a beanstalk I’d never noticed before. He and Goose dropped into a cloud. I was halfway down after them when I heard him shout to his mom. For an ax.
The beanstalk toppled. I fell from the sky and landed with a crash. Ow-wow-wow-wow. Wow. The boy and his mom stepped forward. We argued a bit. His mom looked from me to Goose to the boy—Jack—and back again. I looked at my leg. It was broken.

Tip 1: Eat trail mix before you sleep because digesting food warms up your body.
Tip 2: Keep a hot water bottle in your sleeping bag. It warms your feet.
Tip 3: Keep your mouth and nose out of your sleeping bag. That way, wetness from your breath will not get into your sleeping bag and make you cold.

Then he wished for meat—roast beef, ham, chicken, and turkey. He had to stop in the middle and sandwish for a ladder. He climbed it to pile on more.
He slapped on lettuce, a fresh tomato, and pickles. He added relish and a slice of eye-watering onion.
Up and down the ladder of wishes he climbed. He piled on more and more. He finally had to sandwish a crane to drop on the last slice of bread.
There it was! It was a mile-high monster meal. It was a sandwished sandwich like no other sandwich wished for before.
This special boy was ready to eat. But where could he start? He walked around and around, looking up and down. There was no way to start eating this sandwish. There was no way to end.
The very special boy leaned up against the sandwich. He closed his eyes and made yet another sandwish.
He wished for alphabet soup, please, and a sandwich of peanut butter and jiggly jelly-jam. He ate it all and filled his tummy. He whispered softly, “Thanks—that was yummy.”",570.0

At the park, they saw a puppy. It was all alone and did not have a tag. The puppy was playing with Jae’s baseball!
“Mom, I think this puppy needs a home,” Jae said. His mother smiled. “Yes, he does,” she said. “It will be your job to look after him,” she added. Jae smiled.

"Number Twelve Is Everywhere!
We use the number twelve to help us do things every day. It helps us to count things, measure length, and tell time.
Did you ever wonder why a year has twelve months? A ruler has twelve inches? A clock has twelve hours?
Long ago, people needed an easy way to count things. How many goats did they have? How many bricks did they need?
They didn’t have pencils, but they always had their fingers. How could their fingers help them count things?
Your hand has four fingers and one thumb. Fingers bend into three parts. All of your finger parts add up to—twelve!
To learn how people counted, use the thumb of your other hand. Count the parts of each finger. One, two, three, four, five, six . . .
Using their fingers, people could count their farm animals. They might count six chickens, three sheep, and three goats. They had twelve animals!
When their animals had babies, it was easy to count them, too. Using both hands, people could count to twenty-four. Twenty-four is two twelves!
Fingers, and the number twelve, were also used to find length. An inch was the width of an adult man’s thumb. A foot was twelve thumbs long.
Soon, people cut twelve marks for thumb widths on a stick. It was easy to carry the stick. That stick was the first kind of twelve-inch ruler!
People used the number twelve to divide their days into parts, or hours, that they could count. In daylight, they watched the shadow of a stick or a sundial to know what hour it was.
Twelve things are also called a dozen. We buy a dozen pencils in a box. We buy a dozen doughnuts or a dozen eggs. The number twelve helps us to do a dozen things every day!",522.0

" The V-formation makes it easier for the geese to move through the air. They can cut through the air like a knife.
The goose in the front of the formation has to work the hardest. The geese take turns flying in the front. When the goose in front gets tired, a goose from the back takes its place. This is how geese in a flock work together.
Sometimes a goose in a flock gets injured and has to stay behind. Another goose stays behind with the injured goose. It stays until the injured goose gets better.
When the injured goose gets better, it continues to migrate. The other goose that stayed behind migrates, too.
Geese are like a family. They take care of each other. If one goose needs help or is in danger, other geese are there to help.

When April opened the lid to Harold’s home, she only had a couple of small spiders. Harold was disappointed that she didn’t feed him a red jellybean. But he was very hungry. He felt grateful that April fed him so well. Yet, he really wanted a jellybean.
That night, when April was going to bed, she ate a jellybean before brushing her teeth. Then she took another one—a red one—and placed it into Harold’s pitcher.

" Oil rigs drill deep into the ground. Some special oil rigs can float on the ocean. They use pipes to bring the oil to the surface.
Problems can happen when people drill for oil. This floating oil rig caught fire. Some people were killed, and others got hurt.
The oil rig burned and sank into the water. Oil from the well below the rig began to leak into the ocean.
When lots of oil leaks from a well, it makes an oil spill. Oil spills can become very large. Oil spills cause harm to people and other animals.
When oil floats to the shore, it covers everything. Sand and rocks get covered. Birds and other animals get covered. Oil makes a mess and can kill many plants and animals.
Wells are not the only cause of oil spills. Oil tankers are big ships that carry oil across oceans. If an oil tanker crashes or sinks, lots of oil can get in the water. It can take years to clean up the mess from a large oil spill.
Some people think we should not drill for oil under oceans. Some people think we should not ship oil in large tankers. They say it would be easy for something to go wrong. They say that oil spills could happen.
Other people think we should keep drilling for oil under oceans. These people think we can find safe ways to drill for oil and carry it on ships. They say that good rules help keep oil spills from happening.
Everyone agrees that oil spills are bad. But it’s also true that oil is an important resource. Do you think drilling for oil under the ocean is a good idea? Do you think we can take a chance on another oil spill happening?",529.0

When it was time for Jae to go home, he asked Ron, “Can I come again sometime?” “Sure,” Ron said. Wow, losing my keys turned out okay, Jae thought as he walked home.
The next day at school, Jae searched his desk. “Oh, no. Not again!” he groaned. “Need help?” asked his classmate Martina. She was new in school. “Yes, I’ve lost my dinosaur book,” Jae said.
“Do you want to borrow mine?” asked Martina. She showed him a dinosaur encyclopedia. “That’s the same book that I use!” Jae exclaimed. “Are you into dinosaurs, too?” “Yeah,” said Martina. “What’s your favorite?”
“Have you heard of Microraptor ?” asked Jae. “They’re tiny, but fast.” They kept talking. After school, Jae and Martina went to the park to play catch with Jae’s favorite baseball. Martina’s pretty cool, Jae thought as he went home.
The next morning was Saturday. Jae wanted to do some throwing drills, but he couldn’t find his baseball. “Can we go to the park to look for my baseball?” Jae asked his mom.
At the park, they saw a thin puppy without a collar or tags. The stray puppy was chewing on something. It was Jae’s baseball! “Mom, look!” Jae said. “Doesn’t he look like he needs a home?” His mother smiled. “Yes, he does,” she said. “He’ll be your responsibility, though.” Jae nodded excitedly and picked the puppy up.
What a week! Jae thought to himself, walking home with the puppy. I lost my keys, my book, and my baseball, he thought. But every time I lost something, I gained a friend.
He thought about Ron and Martina, and he patted the puppy’s head. “Well, maybe I should lose stuff more often,” he told the puppy. “Why don’t we go see if Ron and Martina want to play a game of catch?”",499.0
" Peacock asked the goddess of animals for a new voice. The goddess replied, “You are jealous of the nightingale, but you should not be. The feathers on your neck shine with every color of the rainbow. And your tail looks as if it is covered in gems. No one has it all. The falcon is very fast. The eagle is very strong. The parrot can speak. The raven is smart. The nightingale has a pretty song. You are big and beautiful. You are special just as you are.”

“Little pigs, little pigs, let me come in,” said the ravenous wolf. “Not by the hairs of our chinny, chin, chins!” answered the little pigs. “Then I’ll huff, and I’ll puff, and I’ll blow your house in,” growled the wolf.
Again, the wolf inhaled deeply. And again, when he exhaled—whoosh— the wolf blew down the house, leaving a pile of sticks. The wolf also blew the little pigs. Down the hill they rolled, like two pink balls.

Our dog, Trixie, is kind to the chickens. She even lets them eat her dog bones! Once a coyote showed up in the alley behind our house. Trixie barked to keep the chickens safe.
Our chickens depend on us to take good care of them. We keep their coop clean and fill their nesting boxes with soft bedding. In the summer, we hang a screen on their coop to keep out the hot sun.
Each afternoon, our chickens eat grass, bugs, and pebbles in the yard. Chickens don’t have teeth— eating pebbles helps them grind up their food. We feed the chickens corn pellets and table scraps, too. They really like grapes and watermelon.
The chickens love to go outside when it rains. The wet soil is a good place to find insects and slugs. When Scott Jr. gets wet in the rain, her feathers stand up like spiky hair. She looks so funny!
My favorite part about having chickens is seeing what color eggs they lay. Sometimes the shells are tan. Sometimes they are light pink or green. We eat the eggs for breakfast.
I also like the sounds that the chickens make when they lay their eggs. They say things like “rah, rah” and “bah-bock, bah-bock!” When we hear the sounds, we know that more eggs are on the way.
One day, our chickens escaped from the yard. We found them under a bush behind our house. We were so happy to see them! We sprinkled their favorite seeds on the ground to lead them back to the coop.
At night, our chickens climb the ladder to their nesting boxes and go to sleep. Dad closes the coop door to keep them safe.

Many days passed at sea. The rats loved being at sea. They had plenty to eat, and no one saw them.
But then the cook began to find evidence of rats. There were ragged holes chewed in the sacks of rice, and something had been nibbling the cheese.

"Ships and boats carry people and goods over water. Before cars, trains, or airplanes, boats were the fastest way to move things. Boats continue to get bigger and faster.
The first boats were carved from single logs. People used poles to push the boats.
Other boats used paddles or oars. Paddles and oars are long pieces of wood with broad, flat ends. They push against the water, moving the boat forward.
Later, people made boats with wooden frames. They covered the frames with bark or animal skins.
Frame boats were larger than log boats. Many people could row at the same time. Some frame boats carried hundreds of rowers.
Sails made from strong cloth were also used to move boats. The sails caught the wind, and the wind pushed the boat.
As ships became bigger, they needed more sails. Sailing ships carried explorers all around the world.
Today, many boats are made of metal and plastic. Many ships and boats use engines to turn propellers. The propellers push the boat through the water.
People still use smaller boats for fishing, fun, and sport. Many boats that carry one or two people still use paddles or oars.
Cruise ships are like floating hotels. They can carry thousands of people. Huge tankers carry oil and gas over the ocean.

How Do Hermit Crabs Live?
Hermit crabs live in warm oceans all around the world. Some hermit crabs live on beaches or in tidal pools. Others live in the water. All hermit crabs are scavengers. They will eat just about any food they can find. Seaweed? Love it. Dead fish? They’re great. Rotting wood? Dinner is served.
Hermit crabs are mostly nocturnal, which means they move around at night. They hide in their shells during the day.
Hermit crabs start as eggs. The eggs hatch in the water, and larvae (LAR-vee) float out. The larvae look like tiny shrimp. For a few months, they grow and change shape. When they are big enough, they find an empty seashell and join the colony.
As young hermit crabs grow, their exoskeletons don’t get any bigger. So every year or so, they molt. They get rid of their old exoskeleton and grow a new one that’s the right size. Hermit crabs can live to be thirty years old, but most live six to ten years.
Danger!
Birds, octopuses, fish, and other animals will eat hermit crabs if they can. If a crab senses danger, it pulls into its shell and sits still.
Hermit crabs got their name by mistake. Hermit crabs hide inside their shell “homes” when they are scared. People thought this meant they wanted to live alone, like hermits. But these crabs don’t like to live alone at all. They like to live in groups.
Watch Them Run!
Hermit crabs look funny when they run across the sand. But they do more than make us smile. Hermit crabs have important jobs to do. They keep beaches clean by eating dead fish and plants. Seeing hermit crabs is usually a sign that a beach is healthy.",602.0
" While he slept, that goose laid a perfect golden egg. Then another.
I stepped out of the cupboard. I grabbed the goose (and a doughnut) and tiptoed away. But the giant woke up. He chased after us, roaring all the way. He was almost as mad as my mom. Hoo-wee!
I ran for my life. Scrambling down the beanstalk, I shouted, “Mom, Mom, bring the ax !” She brought it. I grabbed it. Then I chopped the beanstalk with all my might.
The beanstalk toppled to the ground, and the giant fell from the sky. He landed with a crash. “Ow-wow-wow-wow!” he moaned. “I think my leg is broken.”
Mom and I crept forward. The giant groaned and moaned some more. “He’s hurt,” she said. “He’s dangerous,” I said. “ He’s a thief,” said the giant. “My goose lays golden eggs, and he stole her.” “He’s a man-eater,” I said. The giant shrugged. I shrugged. My mom looked from the giant to the goose to me, and back again. All the while, the giant kept moaning and groaning. “I can fix your leg,” she said at last. “But you’ll have to stay here until it heals.”
“ Then what?” he groaned. “How do I get back to my castle?” I dug the fifth bean from my pocket. The giant looked surprised. “Fine,” he grumbled.
For the next six weeks, George the Giant stayed with us. He ate a wagonload of food every day. But the goose laid golden eggs every day. Pretty soon, Mom and I weren’t poor any more.
When George was healed, he stuffed the goose in his pocket and climbed back up to his castle. But sometimes the two of them drop by. Always at dinnertime. And when they do, we all enjoy a bowl of Mom’s green bean soup.",496.0

Waiting with the other second graders, Poppy played with her glasses. She hoped her class’s turn would never come. Next to her, Raúl fussed with his hair. “You’re lucky your parents didn’t make you get a haircut,” he complained. “That’s nothing,” said Lei. “At least you can still smile for the camera.” Lei showed that a few of her teeth were missing.

“Second graders,” the photographer called. “You’re up!” The class marched onto the stage. “What a great-looking bunch!” she said, moving Poppy to the front. Maybe it would be okay if I took my glasses off for the picture, Poppy thought. Just then, the photographer whispered, “Nice glasses.” Poppy saw her wink from behind her own bright red glasses.
Poppy smiled and looked at her classmates. They couldn’t take off a bad haircut or hide a broken arm. They were all different, she realized. That’s what made them special. She left her glasses on for the picture. “Cheese!” the class called out. Poppy smiled her brightest. Picture day hadn’t gone the way she had planned. It had gone even better.

Gretel swung her broom at the cage, knocking it from its hook. As the cage and Hansel came crashing down, the woman stumbled backward and fell. Hansel wiggled free. Together, Hansel and Gretel pushed the woman into the cage and slammed the door. “Let me out!” she screamed. Hansel grabbed the treasure chest, and the children fled into the forest.
They were back where they’d started, lost in the woods. Still, Hansel and Gretel felt less afraid than before. They kept walking. Soon they heard a voice calling their names from far away. Afraid, they hid in the bushes and waited. Then they realized who it was.
“Father!” Gretel cried. The children ran to him. Father’s eyes were red from crying. “I’m so sorry,” he wept. “I sent your stepmother away.

An earthworm’s body is shaped like one tube inside another. On the outside is a tube of muscle. On the inside is a tube that breaks down food.
The body of an earthworm is made up of many parts. Each part is shaped like a ring and can bend and stretch.
Earthworms move by stretching out their bodies and pulling themselves forward. Short, tough hairs on their bellies help them hold onto the ground.
Slimy Worms!
Earthworms are slimy. The slime helps keep earthworms cool and wet. It also helps earthworms slide through soil.
After worms mate, a ball of slime forms. The slime dries into a cocoon. Baby worms come out of the cocoon.
Earthworms build long tunnels underground. The tunnels protect worms from heat and sunlight. They also help earthworms hide from hungry animals.
Earthworms are sometimes called night crawlers because they come out at night to feed. They use their mouths to pull dead leaves and plants into their tunnels.
Farmers love earthworms! When earthworms dig tunnels, they make space in the soil. The space helps plants get what they need to grow.
Some people raise earthworms on worm farms. The earthworms eat food scraps, turning them into rich soil. Earthworm waste helps plants grow big and strong.
Wanted: Earthworms!

Sometimes my mom and I go to Millennium Park. Millennium Park is huge and has lots of things to do. The first thing I always do is run to the giant silver bean. Its real name is Cloud Gate.
I like to lie next to it and see my reflection. I love how it reflects the city and the people all around it. If you walk under it and look up, you see something magical.
We also visit the outdoor theater. Sometimes I stand where the audience sits. I pretend that I am listening to my favorite singer.
At other times, I sit on the stage and pretend I am the one singing. I can hear the crowd clapping and cheering for me.
But the thing I love the best is to tickle my toes in Crown Fountain. Crown Fountain has two gigantic towers of glass blocks. The blocks show different videos of faces and places. Water spills down from the top.
People of all ages come here to laugh and play in the water. I like to turn cartwheels and feel the water drip down my legs.
Each park has a stand that sells cool drinks and ice cream. Sometimes my mom gives me money, and I get to choose and pay. It makes me feel grown up.
After a long day, my mom and I take the El back home. El is short for elevated train. We wait on the platform for our train to come. We don’t have to wait long.
During the ride home, I look out the window and watch the buildings whiz by. I think about what I will do the next time I go to the park. Will I play soccer? Will I play in water, or will I just turn cartwheels all day? City parks are the best!",559.0
" A generator is a machine with huge blades that spin to make energy. A large power plant near your town may have many generators. Many kinds of fuel are used to run the generators.
About half the energy used to run generators comes from burning coal. Coal is a natural rock resource that is usually mined under the ground. Power plants can burn coal to make energy to heat water.
When water becomes hot enough, it changes to steam. Flowing steam makes the fan blades inside a steam generator spin fast. Generators use energy made by the spinning blades to make electricity.
Wind can be used to make electricity. Blowing wind turns the large blades of a wind generator. The generator uses energy from the spinning blades to make electricity.
Moving water can be used to make electricity. People build dams to block rivers. Water from a river moves through large pipes in the dam. The moving water spins the blades of the dam’s generators.
Some places under the earth are very hot. They have layers of hot rock and hot water deep underground. Hot steam rises out of openings in the ground. The steam is trapped in pipes and used to spin the blades of a generator.
People can use the Sun’s energy to make electricity. Solar cells and solar panels can change sunlight into electricity. Solar cells make this car move!
People use more energy each year. We use lots of coal, oil, and natural gas to run our cars, homes, and businesses. Our natural resources are limited. They can’t last forever.
It is important not to waste resources like coal, oil, and natural gas. When they are gone, they can’t be replaced. Sun and wind are good energy resources to use instead. Sun and wind cannot be used up.",610.0
" Soon, the blue egg hatched,” Grandmother Sasha read.
“The baby goose loved the kind woman. It lived with her for the rest of her life,” read Sasha. “The woman never felt all alone again.” “That’s the dancing goose in my music box!” Anna said.
Anna got up early the next morning. “This kistka pen draws with warm wax,” Sasha said, “as you would draw with ink. The design on this egg will have parts that are white, yellow, green, and dark blue. I’m drawing the part I want to be yellow.”
“This wax will protect the yellow part of the design when I dip the whole egg in green dye,” Sasha explained. “Another wax drawing protects the parts I want to be white.” “Watch closely, while I tell you a story about painting eggs.”

Through the fence and into the barnyard he went. When he found the biggest pile of cow manure, he jumped on it.
He rolled around and around. He rubbed his fur through the delightful smelling cow manure. Ah, this is heavenly, he thought.
When he had enough, Clyde stood up. Again he stuck his nose high into the air. And again, he began to sniff.
Soon he smelled another lovely odor. It drifted toward him from the stable. Clyde panted with excitement at the smell of another favorite—horse manure.
After rolling around in the horse manure, Clyde felt even more refreshed.
He walked happily from the stable. And what do you think he smelled? You guessed it. Drifting past the stable was Clyde’s absolute favorite odor—pig manure.
So off he ran toward the pigpens. Soon he was standing over a mud hole. He jumped in and rolled around in the mud and pig manure.
Clyde felt quite content. He thought he smelled great, so he headed back home. When he arrived home, he slipped through the doggy door and into the house.

John was sitting on the cot with his head in one hand. With the other, he held a bag of ice on his knee.
“Hi, John,” I said, skidding into the room. John looked up and gave me a weak smile. “Would you please sign my yearbook?” I asked. John’s tiny smile suddenly turned into a big grin.
“Yes, but only if you sign mine,” he said. We traded our books. I opened his and saw only a few names here and there. When I looked over at John, he was running his fingers over all my signatures.
“I wanted to have everyone sign mine this year,” he said sadly. “Then I got stuck in here.” His smile had turned into a frown. “I know what to do,” I said. “My parents said I can have a big birthday party in July. If you come, you can have lots of kids sign it then.”
“Really?” John said, and his smile came back. I nodded. “That would be great!” he said.

The morning passes quickly. The other children are kind and helpful. Raj is quiet. He is frightened that he might say or do the wrong thing again. A bell sounds loudly, and Raj looks around, confused. “It’s time for lunch!” Sandeep says. They join the class as it forms a line by the door. “The early bird gets the worm!” Mr. Washington says.
“Are there other things to eat?” Raj asks Sandeep. “I don’t think I would like worms.” “It’s an idiom —a saying,” Sandeep explains. “He means that the first to arrive get the best choice of food.” Raj shakes his head in dismay. This new way of speaking English confuses him. Raj chews his nails as they walk to the lunchroom.

“Ben is part of the Animals for Rent program with City to Farm,” said Ms. Vega. “He takes care of Mabel, one of our cows.” “What’s City to Farm?” asked a girl. “Maybe Ben can explain it to the rest of the class,” said Mr. Perkins.
“City to Farm is an organization for young people,” Ben told them. “Grownups show city kids what life is like on a farm. I want to learn about cows, but I live in an apartment. I can’t keep a cow there!” The class laughed. “So,” Ben said, “Ms. Vega ‘rents’ Mabel to me. I don’t pay to rent her. We just sign an agreement. My mom brings me here three times a week to care for my cow.”
“Why don’t we go meet Mabel?” said Ms. Vega. Ben led the class into a large barn with many stalls. Marcos squinted to see in the barn’s dim light. What he saw made him stop short. There, in the second stall, was a llama.
Marcos began speaking softly to the animal in Spanish. As if it understood, the llama bent its long neck toward him. Marcos reached up and stroked the gentle animal’s fur.
Ms. Vega watched Marcos. “Do you like llamas?” she asked. Marcos nodded. “Sí. I mean, yes,” he replied shyly. “My grandfather had llamas in Ecuador.” “Paco here came from Ecuador, too,” said Ms. Vega. “We are going to try to raise llamas for wool.”
Ms. Vega said to Marcos, “Maybe you could help us. I could rent Paco to you just as I rent Mabel to Ben.” Marcos’s eyes got big. “And I could take care of Paco?” he asked. Ms. Vega smiled. “Sí,” she said. Marcos’s heart soared. His mother had been right. Ranches were different in the United States, but llamas were the same!",535.0

First she explained where the sun came from. “Do you see that large mountain? The one that is towering above all other mountains?” she asked, pointing east. Ichiro replied, “Yes, I do. In fact I see the sun rise over that mountain each morning.”
“Well,” said the wise woman, “that is where new suns come from. Each night after the sun sinks into the sea, people from the village go to the mountaintop. They carry large pieces of wood and coal with them.”
“They drop the wood and coal into a large opening at the top of the mountain,” she said. “The mountain begins to rumble. It roars and smokes.”
The wise old woman kept telling her story. “By morning, the rumbling is very loud. Then suddenly the mountain spits out a giant ball of fire. The ball is spit out with great force. It shoots up high into the sky. The fireball lights the land below as it travels across the sky. It also heats the land.”
“When the ball of fire reaches its highest point, it begins to drop,” she continued. “In a few hours it crashes into the sea. The cool waters of the sea put out the ball of fire.”
“It is very important that the villagers go to the mountain each night. They must feed it wood and coal,” she said. “As long as we feed the mountain, it will make a new sun each morning. But if ever we fail to do so, there will be no new sun. Then the land will become dark and cold.”
From that day on, Ichiro worried no more. He played happily in the trees. He knew there would always be light and heat as long as the villagers took coal and wood to the mountain.",580.0

All four Hoppers leapt inside Grandpa Grizzly’s snowplow. They sat up high while the plow pushed a path through the snowstorm.

A tortoise was sitting quietly in a tree. No one was sure how it had gotten up there, but that is another story. The tortoise was very smart and was also very old. It knew what the dog was. In fact, it knew just about everything there was to know. “Have you given up?” the tortoise asked the monkey. The monkey replied, “Yes, I think so. We cannot decide whose family this creature is from.”
Tortoise replied, “You might want to call him ‘Dog’ unless you have a better name. If you ask me, and you didn’t, ‘Dog’ is the perfect name.” Hearing its name spoken, the dog woke up. It was not happy to be awake. It saw all the other animals staring at it.
“Who was mean enough to wake me up?” the dog asked. It wasn’t feeling very polite. The dog bared its big, pointed teeth and growled. It barked and barked. All the animals scattered. They were afraid that the dog wanted to eat them.
The tortoise was safe in its tree, since dogs can’t climb trees. “You can’t get me. But from now on, all the animals will run from you, and you will chase them,” said the tortoise, laughing as it tucked its head into its shell.

" Then they grow tails.
After breakfast, we walked down to the beach. Gram turned over the upside-down crabs. She also put stranded ones back into the ocean.
She said when crabs get tired of swimming, they turn over onto their backs and float on their shells like little boats. When they are hungry, they let themselves sink slowly to the bottom of the ocean. On the bottom, the crabs eat plants, small clams, worms, and other tiny sea animals. They grind food with their legs, so they have to be walking to chew their food! Scientists study horseshoe crabs to learn more about their nine eyes and nervous systems. Also, their blood can be used to test for some human diseases (diz-EEZ-es) and to test new drugs. Gram said horseshoe crabs have been around since dinosaurs roamed the Earth!
Gram gave me a job to do. Every morning I hurried to the beach to save as many crabs as I could. I would turn them over and toss them back into the ocean waves. Sometimes I’d toss them from the end of the jetty and wave “good luck” to them. I also tried to chase birds away when I saw them eating the eggs. But Gram told me not to do that because the birds needed the eggs as food to survive.
One morning, all the horseshoe crabs were gone. When I ran back to the house, Gram said they were done laying eggs until next year. She told me that next year I would have to come back and save more crabs! I walked back to the beach and lay down on the warming sand. Saving the crabs was exciting, but my summer vacation had just begun. What would I do now?",650.0

Laws kept black people and white people separate . White children and black children went to different schools.
Black people had to sit at the backs of city buses. The front seats were for white people.
Dr. King wanted the unfair laws to change. He talked to many people about how to change the laws.

When she was old enough, Jane worked and saved her money. When she had saved enough, she went on a trip to Africa. In Africa, Jane met Dr. Louis Leakey, a famous scientist.
When Jane met Dr. Leakey, he needed help with an important new animal study. The study would look at how chimpanzees behave. Dr. Leakey asked Jane to work on the chimpanzee study with him.
To work on the study, Jane and her mother moved to the country of Tanzania (tan-zuh-NEE-uh). They lived with chimpanzees in the Gombe (GOME-bay) Forest.
At first, most of the chimps in Gombe were afraid of Jane. Only a chimp she had named David trusted her. He let Jane meet his family group.
Jane wrote notes as she watched the chimps every day. Her notes upset many scientists. They had their own beliefs and ideas about how chimps behaved.
Jane said chimps were smart. She said they used sticks as tools to dig up bugs to eat. She also said chimps showed feelings, as humans do.
Jane saw chimps that were happy, sad, and angry. She saw that each chimp behaved in its own way, just as humans do.
Jane’s work made some scientists think again about their old beliefs and ideas about chimps. They saw that some of their old ideas might be wrong. Some scientists agreed with Jane.
After many years in Gombe, Jane became very worried. People were cutting down trees in the Gombe Forest. Hunters were stealing baby chimps.

Karate began long ago on an island in Asia. Now, people do karate all over the world!
Karate students practice in a special gym. They wear a robe and a belt. They learn to listen to their teacher.
Karate belts come in many colors. Students get new belts as they get better at karate.
The teacher gives new belts to students when they practice hard. They must have good habits and follow the rules.
Students earn new belts in a certain order. The different colors of the belts stand for the colors of the Sun, plants, and sky. Like a plant, a student grows over time.
Students learn karate in three main steps. First, they learn to breathe, move, and stand a certain way. They also learn to be very patient.
Students are told to breathe out from their bellies. They also learn to let out a big shout as they do a move. When students shout, their moves are stronger.
Next, students practice moves in a certain order. They learn how to defend themselves. They also learn how to flow from one move to the next.
In this step, students also learn why the moves are useful. They think about each move before they do it.
Finally, students practice the moves on one another. They work very hard to get to this last step.

What Is Baseball?
Baseball is a game with two teams. A team has nine players. Baseball teams play in an open field. Players use a bat, a ball, gloves, and four bases.
A pitcher on one team throws the ball to a catcher on the same team. A batter on the other team hits the ball with the bat. The batter runs to first base, second base, and third base. The runner scores one point if he or she reaches the fourth base—home plate.
People have played baseball for hundreds of years. Long ago, people from England brought ball games to America.
The games were like baseball in many ways. Over time, people made new rules and the games became one game—baseball.
Baseball fans love the fields where their teams play. In Boston, the team plays at Fenway Park. It is the oldest ballpark in America.

“Fall forward” sounded better, so she set her clock forward an hour. Just like that, it was past her bedtime. She was late again. “Time is not my friend,” Nola sighed.
The next morning when Nola woke, her clock said 10:15. The parade began at ten o’clock.
Nola and Pablo ran to the parade route, but there was no parade. It seemed they’d missed the whole thing. They turned and headed home.
On their way back, they spotted their neighbor Frank. He was climbing around next to an eight-foot pumpkin float. “The early bird gets the worm!” he shouted, then asked for their help. They worked on his float for more than an hour. Then Frank clapped his hands. “Let’s get to that parade!” he cried.
Nola and Pablo blinked in confusion. “Wait a minute,” Nola said. “Wasn’t the parade at ten o’clock today?” she asked.“ Was at ten?” Frank asked. “Will be at ten is more like it!” he cried. He thrust his watch toward them. It said 9:30. Nola laughed for joy.

“I hope I get a calendar,” Carlos said to Mama. “I’ll put a star in December,” said Carlos. “So I know when we’ll come back for Navidad, again!”",549.0
" The show looks exciting.
This is a very big painting. The light on the woman’s dress makes it look like she’s really sitting here. A note on the wall tells us about the artist and the painting.
This is a very old sculpture. Parts of it have broken off. But you can still see how the man looked. I wonder if he was a king.
I like this painting. It seems like the little girl is looking down at us. She looks surprised to see us here.
These old paintings are very beautiful. The lines on the lady’s collar and dress are so small. The artist must have used a very tiny brush.
It’s time for a snack. The museum has a snack bar that sells food and drinks. My sister is having lunch.
This is my sister’s favorite part of the museum. There is a room with costumes in it. She is dressing up to look like one of the people in the old paintings. Then she gets her picture taken.
We can even make art ourselves. The museum has special benches used for drawing. We use pencils and paper to draw the flowers. A picture of flowers is called a still life.
The museum has too many paintings to show at once. Some paintings are stored away. You can see the stored paintings on the computer. The computer has a note about each painting and artist.
The museum has a gift shop. There are lots of books about art. They have books for kids, too. Some of the art is really colorful and crazy. I think I’d like to have this book.
My sister and I are tired, but we had fun. The art museum is a great place to visit. I hope we go to the art museum again soon.",517.0

Long ago, people from Europe settled in North America. They saw First Nations people playing lacrosse. The settlers liked the game and started playing it. Sometimes, they played with First Nations people.
For a while, mostly settlers in Canada played lacrosse. Then, some schools in the United States began playing. Still, the game wasn’t popular. The sticks used in the game were handmade and hard to get. Later, sticks were made more simply. Over time, people began playing the game across the country.
Today, men, women, boys, and girls play lacrosse. Lacrosse teams usually play outside in a field. Sometimes they play indoors. This is called box lacrosse. Lacrosse is popular in schools. There are two leagues in North America.
Lacrosse is most popular in Canada and the United States. People in England and Australia also play the sport. Today, lacrosse is catching on all over the world!
A game starts with one player from each team in the middle of the field. The ball is on the ground between the players. When the whistle blows, the game begins. The two players use their sticks to get the ball.
When a player gets the ball, he or she runs to get to the net. The player can also pass the ball to another player using the stick. Each team tries to keep the ball.
One player on each team is the goalie. He or she stands next to his or her team’s net. The goalie’s job is to keep the ball from going into the net. If the ball goes into the net, it is worth one point. At the end of the game, the team with the most points wins!
Now, more than ever, people love playing lacrosse. It is a fun team sport that is exciting to play and to watch!",495.0
" As soon as Leopard got home, he went to Jackal. Jackal’s house was close by.
“I had such a fright!” panted Leopard. “I saw such a fierce fellow! He had a large head, terrible horns, and a rough voice! He said his name was Ram.”
“How foolish you are!” Jackal laughed. “Ram cannot hurt a flea, and his meat is juicy and sweet. I thought you were a hunter. Tomorrow we shall go and eat him.”
Leopard was still afraid. He wanted to seem brave, so he said he would go. The next day, Jackal tied Leopard to his leg with a string. This way, Leopard could not run away.
Ram saw the two friends as they came to the top of the hill. Ram ran into his house. “Wife, what shall we do?” he asked. “Jackal and Leopard are both after us.”
“Have no fear,” said his wife. “Take our child in your arms and go outside. Pinch her to make her cry as if she were hungry.”
Ram took the child and did as he was told. He stepped outside just as Leopard and Jackal arrived.
As soon as Leopard saw Ram, he grew afraid. He pulled back, but Jackal jerked the string. “Come on,” he said. “He cannot hurt you.”
Ram saw Leopard’s fear, and he pinched the child. The child began to cry, and Ram said in a rough voice, “Jackal, you have done well. You have brought us the leopard to eat. You are just in time. My child is crying for food.”
These words were more than Leopard could stand. He leaped away and began to run, dragging Jackal with him. Leopard ran up and down hills, through bushes, and under rocks. He did not look back until poor Jackal was bruised from head to toe.",516.0
" He spent his days eating the fruit of the tree and swinging in its branches.
One day, Crocodile took rest under the tree. Monkey greeted Crocodile, saying, “As you are under my tree, that makes you my guest. Allow me to offer you food.”
Monkey tossed down fruit after sweet fruit to Crocodile. Crocodile visited Monkey’s tree each day after that.
One day, Crocodile asked Monkey to cross the river with him for dinner. He called up to Monkey, “Please join me. I should have invited you sooner.”
“I’d love to come,” Monkey said, “but I can’t swim. How shall I cross the river?” “Please take a ride on my back,” Crocodile said. “It would be my pleasure.”
“The pleasure is all mine,” said Monkey. He left his safe tree and climbed onto Crocodile’s back.
They set out across the river. “What, may I ask, is for dinner?” Monkey asked.
By this time, the two were halfway across the river. Since it was now impossible for Monkey to escape, Crocodile told him the truth. “You are for dinner, my furry little friend. I am taking you home to eat you.”
The monkey was scared to death. His heart boomed in his chest, but he kept his wits about him.
“In that case,” Monkey said, “let me fetch my heart. Of all my parts, it tastes the best, but I left it back in my tree.” “Oh, yes,” Crocodile agreed, “please fetch your heart!”
Crocodile turned and swam back to Monkey’s tree. As soon as they reached the riverbank, Monkey jumped off and climbed out of reach. He laughed down at Crocodile.
“Crocodile,” he called, “my big, scaly friend, I won’t be coming tonight for dinner.”
Crocodile was angry and ashamed. He knew then that Monkey had outsmarted him. From that day forward, monkeys have never trusted crocodiles.",532.0
" There will be rain in front of you, where you’ll see the rainbow.
Rainbows need water drops and sunlight to form. They can even form under a bright moon. These are called moonbows.
We usually see a rainbow as a half circle. It actually forms a full circle. From the ground, we can only see the top half.
Years ago, a French scientist studied rainbows. He found that to see a rainbow, you must be in the right spot.
Knowing how light moves helps explain rainbows. Think of running on land. Now think of trying to run through water. You will move more slowly through water because it is thicker than air. In the same way, light moves faster through air than through water. As the light moves through water, it slows down and bends.
Rainbows form when water drops meet sunlight. The light bends when it goes into each drop. Then it reflects, or bounces, off the back of each drop. The light bends again as it leaves the drop. This happens in millions of water drops at once, making the colors of a rainbow.
Sunlight is made up of many colors. Water drops split the sunlight into different colors. Splitting light makes a rainbow.You have to be in the right spot to see a rainbow. Each water drop reflects colored light at a slightly different angle.
The colors of the rainbow always appear in the same order. The name ROY G. BIV can help you remember the seven main colors. They are red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet.
Rain stops and the Sun comes out. A beautiful rainbow sweeps across the sky. Most people find it hard not to stop and stare when a rainbow appears. Science explains how rainbows form. Still, a rainbow is always a magical sight to see.",551.0

Next, Jennie was riding too close to the parked cars. Dad pedaled up to her. “Be careful because you never know when a car door might open,” Dad said. Jennie saw a car door opening. Dad had to swerve to miss it.
Then, Dad saw a stop sign ahead. “What do we do at a stop sign?” Dad asked. “We stop and look both ways for cars,” Charlie and Jennie said.
“What do we do if we need to make a left turn?” Dad asked. “We give a signal,” Charlie and Jennie said.
Dad watched them stop, look both ways, and signal a left turn before riding on. Dad felt so proud that he rode after them without signaling or looking. He didn’t see the car until it honked its horn at him.
Next, Charlie was trying to ride without holding on to the handlebars. Dad pedaled up to him. “Hold on to your handlebars or you might crash!” Dad said.
Charlie put both of his hands on the handlebars. Dad lifted his hand to pat Charlie on the shoulder. He didn’t see the pothole until he hit it and crashed.
“Are you okay?” Jennie and Charlie asked. Dad nodded. “That’s why you wear a helmet and never let go of the handlebars,” he said.
Finally, they made it to the park. Jennie and Charlie ran and hugged Mom. “We rode our bikes all the way here, and we were safe!” they said. Dad walked up slowly and fell onto the picnic blanket.

The mayor is usually in charge of the town or city council. The council decides how money is spent in the community. It might spend money to build or fix roads, buildings, and parks. It has meetings for people to talk about ideas for the community.
The mayor and council also work together to make laws. Laws are important.
A community needs laws to keep people safe and keep the community clean. Some laws say how fast cars can go on the roads. Other laws say people must not throw their trash on the ground.
Police officers make sure people follow the laws. They also help people who are in trouble.
When people break the laws, they may go to court. In court, a judge or a jury decides whether someone broke the law. A judge is the head of the court. A jury is a group of people from the community. The jury listens to both sides and decides whether someone broke the law. Sometimes there is no jury, and the judge decides. If the judge or jury decides that someone broke the law, the judge decides the punishment.
Other people in the government also help the community. Firefighters put out fires and help people get away from fires. Emergency workers help people who are sick or hurt. They may take people to a hospital.
The community government is important. It makes a difference in the lives of people every day. The government gives people in a community a good and safe place to live.
People can make a difference in their government, too. They can run in an election. They can vote. They can speak at community meetings. They can also offer to help in parks and other places. What can you do to make a difference?",556.0
" “You’ll never grow big, leaping like that,” said another salmon.
But she did grow—just like the others. Soon, they knew it was time to leave home. They swam downstream and headed for the ocean.
“On the trip, she practiced her leaps. “ I was born to leap!” she said, jumping higher and higher. “You’ll hurt yourself, leaping like that,” said the other salmon. “But she never did.
“In the ocean, she practiced her special leaps. “ She did a sideways roll! She did a double twist! She did a triple backward flip! “I must say,” said another salmon, “she is a lovely leaper.”
Years later, the salmon knew it was time to go home. It was time to go upstream to spawn. Soon they would lay the eggs that would become baby salmon. They swam against the current of the stream. They struggled through rapids, leaped over waterfalls, and darted away from hungry predators.
Then, at one waterfall they met a bear! “We’ll never make it,” said one salmon. “We’re done for,” said another. ”Maybe not,” said the lovely leaper. She gathered all her strength and swam forward. She leaped with all her might.
The bear had never seen anything like it! He watched her go up and up, higher and higher. He watched her twist one way, then another. He watched her flip end over end, and then backward!
What the bear didn’t see was the other salmon as they jumped the waterfall and swam safely away. Quickly, she followed! With one last mighty flip, she was over the falls and gone.
Home at last, she dug a hole with her tail. As her final task, she laid hundreds of tiny pink eggs. Before long the baby salmon would hatch. Like all salmon, they would be great leapers.
And maybe one would be a really lovely leaper!",536.0
" Her beauty enchanted him. He wanted to meet her, but he could not open the tower door.
Just then, the witch appeared. The prince hid and watched her call to Rapunzel, then climb her hair. When the witch had gone again, he too called, “Rapunzel! Rapunzel! Let down your hair!” and climbed up.
Rapunzel was amazed and frightened when she saw him. But he was kind to her, and soon they were talking like old friends.
After that, the prince visited Rapunzel every evening. Before long, they fell in love.
One night, when Rapunzel was expecting the prince, the witch arrived. She called out, “Rapunzel! Rapunzel! Let down your hair!” “Hurry, my prince!” Rapunzel called back, not realizing the witch was there instead.
When the witch heard this, she climbed up the tower in a rage. “ Wretched girl!” she cried. “Is this how you thank me for my care?” She grabbed a pair of scissors and cut off Rapunzel’s hair. “You will never betray me again!” she said.
The witch dragged Rapunzel to the bottom of the tower. She blasted the stones away from the door and sent Rapunzel into the dark forest.
When the prince came, the witch let him climb up using Rapunzel’s cut hair. “You tried to steal my precious Rapunzel,” the witch said to him. “Now you will never see her again.” She put a curse on the prince to blind him. Then she sent him into the forest, too.
Blind and heartbroken, the prince stumbled through the trees for several days. On the morning of the third day, he heard a voice he knew, singing sadly. “Rapunzel!” he cried. “Is that you?”
Rapunzel rushed to him, weeping. Her tears fell on his eyes, and his sight returned. The prince and Rapunzel went back to his kingdom. Together, they lived happily ever after.",554.0

The sundew is also a meat-eating plant. It has many sticky hairs on its surface. Insects landing on it get stuck. Then the plant digests the insects. The giant sundew plant of Australia even eats small frogs!
Some plants steal food from other plants. The dodder plant sends rootlike parts into another plant. It sucks food and water from the plant. It is a parasite. A parasite lives off another living thing.
Many flowers have bad smells that attract insects. The stapelia flower smells like rotting meat. Flies like the smell, so they fly into the flower. Special powder gets on their bodies. They take the powder to other flowers. The flowers use the powder to make seeds and grow new plants.
Some plants look like stones. The plants in this picture are called “stone plants” or “living stones.” They live in very hot, dry places. They hold water very well. Their shape helps to hide them so that animals do not eat them.
Some cactus plants are covered with wool-like hairs. The “wool” protects them from daytime heat. It protects them from nighttime cold. The “wool” also helps the cactus plants hold moisture.
Some trees and shrubs grow out of solid rock. They grow up high where the wind blows strong. Their roots reach down into small cracks for moisture. As the roots grow, they split the rock.
Some plants have animals living inside them. Ant colonies live inside ant plants. They use spaces in the plant’s stem as houses. Some spaces are used for raising young ants. Other spaces are used for garbage. The ant plant uses some of this garbage for food.

Chen carried his pot to a well with fresh water. Months passed, but the little seed didn’t sprout.
He kept his pet cricket next to the pot. He wanted the seed to hear the cricket’s sweet sounds. Seasons passed, but the little seed still didn’t sprout.
A year passed. It was time to bring the pot back to the emperor’s palace. Chen was sad. His seed hadn’t sprouted at all. His mother found him crying in the garden. “You did your best,” she said. “Bring your pot to the emperor and tell him what happened.”
Children came to the emperor’s palace with their pots full of flowers. Chen looked down sadly at his empty pot.
The emperor walked slowly through the crowd of children and flowers. Something was wrong. The emperor didn’t look pleased. At last he came to Chen and his empty pot.
“What’s this?” the emperor demanded. “Why is your pot empty?” he asked. Chen said, “I’m sorry. I put the seed in a pot. I moved it into a bigger, fancier pot. I made sure it had sunlight. I gave it the freshest water. I even let my cricket keep it company at night! No matter what I did, it wouldn’t grow. I tried my best.”
Suddenly, to Chen’s surprise, the emperor shouted, “I’ve found the next emperor! I don’t know how the rest of you grew your flowers. The seeds I gave out were boiled. They could never have grown. But this child was honest and used his best effort to try to grow the seed.”

A desert tortoise lives in this hole! This animal lives in a desert. It digs a burrow to get away from the heat. It spends most of its life in the burrow.
A huge spider lives in this hole! It lives in a deep burrow. A female lays about fifty eggs in a little bag. She takes the bag with her if she leaves to hunt.
This hole belongs to puffins! These birds spend most of their life at sea. They use their strong wings and webbed feet to fly and swim. Puffins swim better than they fly.
Puffins use a burrow as a nest. They dig the burrow on a high cliff. Both parents care for the egg and then the chick.
Naked mole rats live in this hole! They spend their whole lives in the dark. They dig tunnels to find roots to eat.
Naked mole rats work together to build tunnels. One animal digs through soil at the front. Several others sweep dirt toward the back. An animal at the back kicks the dirt out of the tunnel.
A big salamander lives in this underwater hole! It lives in rivers and streams. It hides in a burrow or under rocks during the day. It comes out to hunt at night.
In late summer, males and females gather at burrows. A female lays up to five hundred eggs there. A male watches the eggs to make sure no fish eat them.
A wombat lives in this hole! This animal digs a burrow with its huge claws. It sleeps in its burrow during the day. At night, it comes out to find plants to eat.

Santa Claus jumped straight into the air, he was so surprised. “Oh! What are you doing up, Snubby Nose? You know you’re supposed to be asleep!” Snubby Nose was very startled. He dropped his flashlight and jumped into the closet under the stairs. “I’m sorry I was bad!” Snubby Nose said to himself. “I hope Santa doesn’t put coal in my stocking.”
Snubby Nose could hear Santa filling the stockings. Then, he heard him going up the chimney, and he heard the patter of reindeer hoofs. Finally, he heard sleigh bells ringing into the distance. Snubby Nose was upset, but it was very late, and soon he fell asleep.
The next morning, Speedy Legs, Floppy Ears, and Fluffy Tail ran downstairs. Their stockings were full of treats. Mother and Papa Hopper came down after them.

" It looked like one Mom used for their Thanksgiving. Football... cornucopia... was Canada copying the United States?
At dinner, Curtis sat down to turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes, and pumpkin pie. He blurted out, “Your Thanksgiving is just like ours!” Uncle Ed laughed and said, “We do celebrate in similar ways. In the 1700s, many Americans moved to Canada. They brought their Thanksgiving traditions with them.”
“We probably gave you our holiday, too,” Curtis said. “Actually, we celebrated Thanksgiving before you,” Uncle Ed replied. “However, Thanksgiving is much older than both Canada and the United States.” “Really?” Curtis said, surprised.
“The First Nations people were giving thanks for the harvest long before settlers arrived. Also, Spanish settlers in the southern part of North America celebrated Thanksgiving even before Canada.” “So when did Thanksgiving start in Canada?” Curtis asked.
“An explorer named Martin Frobisher celebrated the first Canadian Thanksgiving in 1578. He gave thanks because he had survived the long trip across the ocean from England to Canada.” “He didn’t give thanks for the harvest?” Curtis asked. “No, and many other Canadian Thanksgivings weren’t harvest celebrations, either,” Uncle Ed said.
“In 1872, Thanksgiving was held because the Prince of Wales survived an illness,” Uncle Ed said. “That prince must have been an important person,” Curtis said. “He later became a king,” Uncle Ed said. “Canadians had a Thanksgiving for that, too!”
“But now Canada gives thanks for the harvest?” Curtis asked. “Yes. In 1957, Canada made its Thanksgiving official. Since then, we have always given thanks on the second Monday in October,” Uncle Ed said.

" Oils and fats give food flavor. When they are removed, the food doesn’t taste as good. To give these foods flavor, sugar is added.
Breakfast cereal is another source of sugar. Many cereals have colorful sugary treats added to them. Even cereals with plain flakes may have a dusting of sugar to make them taste sweeter.
If sugar is such a great source of energy, how can too much of it be bad? The body cannot just get rid of sugar it does not use. Instead, it changes the sugar to fat and stores it for later. The more sugar that is not used the more fat the body makes.
A body that has too much fat can have problems. Extra pounds strain bones and muscles. More fat forces the heart to work harder to push blood through the body. Too much glucose in the blood can be bad, too. It can make it hard for some parts of the body to work as they should.
So how can people keep from eating too much sugar? One way is to eat more natural food. Naturally sweet fruits have no added sugars. It’s also better to eat homemade meals instead of prepared food. Cooking at home lets people control what goes into their meals.
Another way to limit sugar is to carefully read food labels. Most food labels have a list of ingredients. The ingredients are listed in order by the amount present in the food. If sugar is near the top of the list, the product probably has a lot of it.
Sugar makes food taste better. It’s what fuels our bodies and keeps us going. Too much sugar can also slow us down if we’re not careful. That’s why it’s important to pay attention to what we eat. Sugar can be almost anywhere!",590.0

Only June, July, and August had first 100° days. “ It’s hard to compare all these tally marks,” complained Harlan. “ A bar graph would show the data much better,” said Nora. “That’s a great idea!” said Harlan. “I’ll get some markers and a piece of paper.” Harlan wrote “FIRST 100° DAYS” across the top of the paper. Next, he drew a line along the left side of the page and labeled it “Number of Days.”
Then he drew a line along the bottom of the page and labeled it “Months.” Nora looked at the chart and counted the tally marks for each month. On the bar graph, she colored in one bar for each mark. June had the fewest marks, and July had the most. The bar graph showed that the first 100° day would probably be in July.
“Well,” said Nora, “based on the graph, we can guess that the first 100 degree day is likely to be in July.” “ And there are thirty-one days in July,” said Harlan. Now they just needed to find thirty- one friends and family members...

John Henry knew he had to beat the machine. If the machine won, the boss would fire the men and use the machine to drill through Big Bend Mountain. But if John Henry won, the boss wouldn’t want the machine. He’d keep paying the men.

Early next morning, Knockmany Hill shook. Cucullin was coming! “Where’s Finn McCool?” shouted Cucullin, bursting through the door. He waved around a bright disk. It was his smashed thunderbolt. “He’s working on the bridge,” Oonagh said sweetly. “I haven’t seen him for weeks.” “I thought I saw him running home. He looked like he was afraid of me!” Cucullin laughed.
“Oh, no,” Oonagh laughed back. “Finn is much bigger and stronger than you. But you can wait for him. I’ll bring breakfast,” she added. Cucullin happily bit into a loaf of Oonagh’s golden-brown bread. “Ouch!” he shouted. “What kind of bread is this? I broke two teeth!”
“Oh, that’s Finn’s bread,” said Oonagh. “The only people who can eat it are Finn and Finn Junior, here.” Oonagh handed a loaf to Finn, still in the cradle. This loaf had no frying pan. Finn ate it in two bites. “Maybe you would like cheese instead?” Oonagh offered.
She set one of the white stones on Cucullin’s plate. She gave Finn the soft cheese, which looked just the same. Finn squeezed the cheese until it dripped. Then he swallowed it whole.
Cucullin squeezed his stone, but nothing came out. He bit down. “Ow!” he screamed. He’d lost four more teeth. “That baby must have iron teeth! Let me look,” he said.
Cucullin pushed Finn’s mouth open with one thumb. Chomp! “Aaaagh! He broke my thumb!” Cucullin screamed. “There’s no way I’ll fight that baby’s father!”
Cucullin ran over the bridge back to Scotland. Then he smashed the bridge to pieces so Finn McCool couldn’t follow him. You can still see the pieces on the coast today.",514.0
" We try to catch the ball and throw it to the base before he gets there.” “Oh,” Zorb said, “that’s right. I try to catch the ball, not catch the people running.”
The next kicker whacked the ball, and it came straight toward Zorb. He ran toward the ball, spread his arms open, and tried to catch the ball in his mouth! The ball smacked Zorb in the face and knocked him to the ground. “What are you doing?” Hector yelled. “What planet are you from?”
“I’m from—” Zorb started, but then he stopped himself and said, “I’m not from around here.” “I can see that,” Hector said. “This is kickball. We don’t chase people, and we don’t catch balls with our mouths.” “I’m sorry,” Zorb said. “I don’t know how to play your game.”
Hector called a time-out, and the team huddled up. The other kids explained the rules and how to kick the ball. Even though everyone else knew more about kickball, no one made fun of Zorb. Maybe humans aren’t so bad after all, Zorb thought to himself.
When it was Zorb’s turn to kick, the pitcher rolled the ball. Zorb tried to remember everything his teammates had taught him about the game. He kicked as hard as he could, and the ball soared over the back fence. His team chanted, “Zorb! Zorb! Zorb!” as he rounded the bases. As he stepped on home plate, Hector gave him a high five.
Zorb saw two grown-ups watching the game. “Did you learn your lesson?” the woman asked. “Dad, Mom, is that you?” Zorb asked. “Yes,” his dad said, lifting up his human mask. “Do you still want to take over Earth?” his mom asked. “No,” Zorb said. “I just want to take over this game.”",507.0
" After thinking for what seemed a long, long time, Sammy finally answered. “Nothing,” Sammy said. “I do absolutely nothing with my stuff.”
“Then why do you have so much of it?” Sammy’s friend asked. “Because,” said Sammy. “Because why?” pressed his friend.
Sammy didn’t know how to answer. So he just blurted out, “Because it makes me happy.” “Well, you sure don’t seem all that happy,” replied Sammy’s friend. “Besides, how can something you do absolutely nothing with make you happy?”
“Wouldn’t all that stuff you have stuffed away make someone who doesn’t have much stuff happier than it makes you?”
Sammy didn’t know how to respond to his friend. He became very frustrated. So he just stomped off. But what his friend said made him think about all his stuff. He began to think that maybe there was truth to what his friend had said.
He thought about how his stuff just sat in drawers, closets, barns, warehouses, and boxcars. He began to realize that he never used it. And he suddenly came to realize it was just stuff.
So after thinking more and more about his stuff, Sammy made a decision. He decided that having so much stuff stuffed away was silly. He thought it made him selfish. And he suddenly realized that it didn’t really make him happy.
So Sammy gave a little of his stuff to someone who had very little stuff. He saw that the stuff made the person happy, and that made Sammy feel good. So he gave more stuff away, and that made him feel even better.
To Sammy’s surprise, giving his stuff to others made him happier than having the stuff for himself. Before long, Sammy had given most of his stuff away. He soon became known as Happy Sammy instead of Sammy Stuffit.",609.0

When Red had picked enough flowers, she set out again for Grandma’s house. When she arrived at Grandma’s cottage under the three large oak trees, she was surprised to find the door open. A feeling of dread flooded her as she stepped inside. “Good morning!” she called, but no one answered. So she went to the bed and drew back the curtains. Before her lay a very strange sight, indeed.
“Oh Grandma,” Red cried, “what big ears you have!” “All the better to hear you with, child,” Wolf said. “Oh Grandma,” Red cried, “what big eyes you have!” “All the better to see you with, child,” Wolf said.“Oh, Grandma,” Red cried, “what a big, terrible mouth you have!” “All the better to eat you with!” Wolf roared.
With one bound, he leapt out of bed and swallowed up Red—flowers, cake, and all. Belly now full, Wolf lay down again on the bed and drifted off to sleep. Inside Wolf’s stomach, it was dark and cramped, but Red managed to reach down and squeeze Grandma’s hand. Grandma squeezed back. Neither spoke—the only sound came from above, and it resembled rolling thunder.
When Red raised her head, she could discern a weak light leaking down Wolf’s throat. Then she understood: Wolf was snoring with his mouth open.Inch by inch, Red lifted her bouquet of flowers. She tickled Wolf’s throat—once, twice, thrice. He coughed once, twice, thrice, then kept on coughing until he coughed Red up. When at last he did, Red held tight to Grandma’s hand and pulled her out, too.
They fastened Wolf, still asleep, to Grandma’s bed. Then Grandma and Red settled down for a nice, long chat. They drank tea and ate cake. When Wolf awoke from his nap, you can be sure he didn’t get any!",561.0

Skunk bragged, “My stench can drive away the workers.” Skunk sprayed a good whiff. “Gross!” Turtle shouted. “You stink.” Turtle retreated into his shell. Skunk laughed and scurried down to Moss Trail. Skunk scampered behind the workers and lifted her tail. The humans smelled her odor immediately, grabbed masks to cover their noses and mouths, and returned to their work. Skunk returned to the woody hill. “That was as easy as A-B-C,” she boasted.
The animals went to check on the humans’ progress. They were upset to see that the humans were still working in the forest. Rabbit fumed, “Our efforts were useless. The humans are still here.” “No matter what we do, we can’t seem to get rid of them,” sighed Bear. For a long time, all the animals felt defeated.
Then one day, they saw something strange. They watched the workers put dirt and grass over the bridge. Moose said, “My goodness, humans are weird.”
Soon the workers left the bridge. Then, the animals saw the workers underneath the bridge. They were putting signs by the side of the road that passed beneath the bridge.
“Hey, wait a minute,” Bear said. “That’s a picture of me! I think this bridge was made for us.” The animals whooped and hollered. “The humans are trying to help us,” Rabbit exclaimed. “They made their bridge into an animal bridge,” Moose added, smiling. Deer said, “Now I can find my herd.” Then she bounded off into the forest.

" Once outside, he waved Jack over. “Jack, me lad,” he called, and handed Jack an old map with a black X painted on it. “Show us the way to me booty!” he said. Jack recognized some of the landmarks. There was the cafeteria, the slide, and an old crooked tree. “I think it’s by the swings,” Jack said.
The class ran to the swings and started digging. Sand flew into the air as they sang a sea shanty Pirate Chalk Beard had taught them. “Heave ho!” cried the pirate. Finally, they heard a clink as they hit something solid. “Avast!” cried the pirate. They helped Chalk Beard lug out an enormous wooden chest. The lid opened with a creak—inside were pirate costumes.
“We share our booty equally,” he said. “Each of you may pick a costume to keep.” The class pulled out the costumes in a frenzy. By the time Jack reached inside the treasure chest, though, there was nothing left. Chalk Beard shook his head. “Alas, me lad. They’re like a hungry bunch of sharks,” he said.
Chalk Beard winked, took off his hat, and set it on Jack’s head. “I was once a shy pirate myself, y’know,” he said. “You were?” Jack asked. “Aye,” the pirate said. Jack felt the brim of the large hat and smiled. “Thank you, Captain,” he said. “Arrr!” Chalk Beard cried. “Me pleasure. Remember, matey, it isn’t the size of your voice that be matterin’. It’s the size of your heart.”
“I’ll remember,” Jack said. He grinned. “I know why it takes pirates so long to learn the alphabet.” “Oh?” said Chalk Beard. “And why might that be?” “Because they spend years at C,” Jack said. Chalk Beard laughed. “So we do,” he said, then stroked his beard. “We also get stuck on ‘Arrr.’”",552.0

Visitors to this beach dig holes in the sand. They’re not making sand castles. They want to sit in the warm water that comes up from beneath the sand.
Glass items were dumped into the ocean as trash for many years at this beach. The waves and rocks made the glass smooth over time. Today, the glass looks like gems.
Not all beaches are found along the shore. This beach is surrounded by land. The water reaches the beach from underground tunnels.
The grains of sand at this beach are shaped like tiny stars. They’re really shells that have been worn down into these shapes.
The round rocks at this beach look like bowling balls. You can visit these amazing rocks during low tide.
Rare turtles come to this black sand beach. The sand is black because it’s made of tiny pieces of rock from a volcano.
The sand at this beach is the color of cotton candy. The white sand mixes with pieces of red shells to make the sand pink.
This beach is full of giant rocks. People aren’t the only visitors to this beach. About three thousand penguins live here.
Have you ever been to a white sand beach? This beach holds the record for being the whitest beach in the world.
This beach is so long that it’s used as a runway for planes. Be careful when swimming here, though. The water is full of sharks.

"What if you could fly like a bird? Where would you go? What would you see?
People always wanted to fly. Some made wings out of wood. One artist drew a plan for a helicopter hundreds of years ago!
Two brothers made the first hot-air balloon. Other people built strange gliders.
Airplanes use engines to stay in the air. The Wright brothers built the first airplane that worked. People could fly!
Airplanes have changed a lot since the early days of flight. Now, large planes can carry your family on vacation.
Some planes today use strong jet engines. They help planes fly high and fast.
Planes that fly low or slow often use propeller engines. Propeller blades spin like a fan’s blades.
Planes carry things quickly over long distances. Planes carry cargo all around the world.
Helicopters fly differently from planes. They can fly in any direction. They can take off straight up and can land almost anywhere.
Flying in a helicopter saves time. Helicopters are used to quickly help people who are lost or hurt.
Hot-air balloons are quiet. They are pushed by the wind. Unlike other flying machines, you can’t steer them.
Blimps are like long balloons. Blimps have engines and are steered by pilots. Have you seen a blimp?
There are many ways to fly. A hang glider drifts on a breeze. A hot-air balloon can take you for a ride. Airplanes fly everywhere. Where would you like to fly?",567.0

Jasmine smiled. Then, she spelled it the right way. She spelled one more word. Then, Mr. Russo said, “You won!”
At lunch, Lilly said, “Tomorrow you will be in the school-wide spelling bee!” “It should be easy,” Jasmine said. “I will probably have to spell baby words like the ones today,” she added. Finn looked sad. “I guess so,” he said.

Jasmine saw Josh, a fourth grader she knew. “I think I’m going to win,” she told him. Josh laughed. “A second grader has never won,” he said.

The burning buildings filled with smoke. It wasn’t safe to use the elevators. People rushed down the stairs.
Two men saw a woman in a wheelchair on floor 68. They saw she needed help, so the men carried her to safety. Many office workers stopped to help others that day.
Not all the heroes were people. Some were dogs. About 400 dogs helped that day. Some dogs looked for hurt and lost people to rescue. Some dogs just helped people feel better.

I ate all my vegetables, but I never seemed to grow.
“Being small has its perks,” Mom said. I doubted it.
One day, Mrs. Alvarez told the class that we’d be putting on a spring play. I was thrilled. The next day she told me I was the perfect size to play the elf.
“I don’t want to be in the play anymore,” I told Mom. “You didn’t get the part you wanted, but you love acting,” Mom said. “I’ll bet you’ll be the best elf in the play,” she added. That won’t be hard to do, I thought. I am the only elf in the play.
In the play’s last scene, the main character finds a box under a giant mushroom. When she opens it, a dog jumps out. Mrs. Alvarez’s dog, Prince, played the dog role. She brought him to all the rehearsals. He liked all the kids, but he seemed to like me best.
The night of the show, Prince jumped out as planned. He jumped into the giant mushroom, though, which fell over. Then he leaped off the stage and disappeared underneath it.
Mrs. Alvarez called him, but he whimpered and wouldn’t come out. “How are we going to get him out of there?” Mrs. Alvarez asked.
“I’m small enough to get him,” I said. I crawled under the stage through the dust and the cobwebs until I reached him. Prince licked my face.

"Do you like to play in water? Do you like to swim? If you do, then you might like life as a beaver.
When you’re a beaver, you can swim days after being born. As an adult, you can hold your breath for fifteen minutes.
A set of clear eyelids allows you to see underwater. You can also close your nose and ears to keep out water.
Your four huge front teeth never stop growing! Chewing on wood all the time keeps them from growing too long. You can chew through a skinny tree in twenty minutes.
Why do you want to chew through a tree? To build a dam!
Behind the dam, you build your home, called a lodge. A lodge is shaped like a dome and made of sticks and mud. In cold weather, the mud freezes hard. This keeps the lodge warm.
Your family, called a colony, lives in the lodge together. You and your mate stay together for many years.
As a beaver, you waste nothing. You eat the leaves, twigs, and bark of the trees you cut down. You store enough limbs under the water near your lodge to last all winter.
In the spring, you dine on ferns and water plants. You fill up on roots, too.
Storing food and working on your dam keeps you busy. You work mostly at night because you are nocturnal.
Some animals hunt you because you’re slow on land. You’re safe in the water, though. When an enemy comes close, you slap the water with your flat, wide tail. The loud sound may warn other beavers.
Your tail also helps you balance when you stand. It helps you steer when you swim. It even stores fat for the winter.
If you like water and don’t mind work, then you might like being a beaver.",532.0

After that, nobody talked to me all morning. I looked for some humans to sit with at lunch, but they were all sitting with other species.
I only found one table with any empty chairs. There, alone, sat one of my classmates, Hululialana. She was so wrapped up in her tentacles , I couldn’t find her face.
I approached with caution and spoke with great care. “Hello, Hululialana,” I said. Slowly, several arms lifted. Then one arm unwound itself, floated toward me through the air, and pulled out the closest chair.
I took a seat. “Thank you,” I said. We looked at each other, then away. She began to wrap herself up again.
“How’s your first day going?” I quickly asked. Hululialana shrugged—I think. “I wish I were still at my old school,” she said. “Me, too,” I said. She looked shocked, and I laughed. “I mean, I wish I were still at my old school,” I explained.
“At least you’re not the only human,” Hululialana said. “I’m the only Hulu.” I thought for a moment. “That makes you special,” I said. “That makes me a freak ,” she said. “Well, let’s be freaks together,” I suggested. Then, for the first time, Hululialana smiled.

Athletes at the Games compete to win medals for their countries. They participate in hundreds of events. Let’s look at some events.
One water sport is swimming. Some swimming races are short, and swimmers swim only two lengths of the pool. Other races are longer.
Some swimming races use only one kind of stroke. In one race, swimmers can choose the type of stroke they want to use.
Diving is another water sport. In diving events, divers jump from high above the water. They twist, flip and turn while in the air. They get points for how well they dive.
Track and field events include running, throwing, and jumping competitions. The marathon is the longest running event. The shortest races are called dashes.
In throwing events, athletes throw objects as far as they can. People competing in these events must be very strong.
In jumping events, athletes jump high or far. In the high jump, athletes leap over a bar. The bar is raised higher and higher until only one person can jump it. In the long jump, athletes leap as far as they can.
Gymnasts leap, flip, and twirl through the air. They need strength, skill, and perfect timing.
Only women compete in the balance beam event. They must balance on the beam while they turn and flip.
Only men compete in the rings event. They hold onto the rings and flip their bodies in circles.

" Dolphin mothers and babies can go without sleep for as long as two months to stay safe.
Some ducks sleep with just half their brains, too. These ducks often sleep in a line. The ducks at both ends help keep the group safe. They keep one eye open to watch for danger. The ducks in the middle sleep deeply with both eyes closed.
Seals breathe air, but that doesn’t stop some of them from sleeping underwater. They hold their breath and dive deep to sleep for up to twenty minutes at a time. Sleeping deep underwater helps these seals stay safe from animals that hunt them near the surface.
Some fish make their own sleeping bags. They make a big spit bubble and sleep inside it. The bubble keeps them in one place all night. It also keeps other animals from smelling them. If an animal bumps the bubble, the fish swims away.
Horses often sleep standing up. Their legs lock in place so they don’t fall over. If a horse is lying down, it needs a long time to get up. A horse can run from danger more quickly if it is already standing.
A flamingo can sleep while standing on one leg. The standing leg locks so it stays straight. The other leg tucks up close to the flamingo’s body. Its head rests on its back. A flamingo lives (and sleeps) near many other birds to stay safe.
Some seabirds can sleep while they fly. These large birds spend most of their lives over the ocean. They are in danger on the water, but they are safe in the air. They glide for many hours without flapping their wings. Sometimes they sleep while they glide.
The animals on this page are sleeping, too. Would you like to sleep how they sleep?",554.0

With five minutes to play, Jason kicked the ball high across the Sharks’ goal. Jamal jumped as high as he could. He hit the ball hard with his forehead.
The ball whizzed past the Sharks goalkeeper. Jamal scored a spectacular goal to make the score Sharks: 2, Dragons: 2.
Jessica decided it was time to help. She left the center circle. The Sharks didn’t notice her moving toward the goal. Even her teammates didn’t notice her. It was as if she were invisible.
One of the Sharks kicked the ball back to his goalkeeper. Jessica ran to the ball and reached it before the goalie. Jessica kicked the ball as hard as she could. The Sharks’ goalie dived to stop the ball.
Jessica’s kick was too powerful. She scored the winning goal. The referee blew his whistle to end the game. The Dragons were the Champions. “You are a great soccer player,” said Jamal.",545.0

In geta (GEH-tah) sandals, I can be much taller! Grandma sent these tall wooden geta from Japan. Both men and women used to wear these sandals with their beautiful silk kimonos. The high wooden platforms kept their kimonos out of the dust and mud.
People started wearing wooden geta over 2,000 years ago. Today, Grandma says this traditional shoe is usually worn only for special occasions and official ceremonies. To wear them, I had to practice how to walk in a new way. But after a few tries, I could do it! I just imagined I was wearing a long silk kimono as I clack-clacked along in my geta!
Next, Grandma sent me some Saami (SAH-mee) reindeer boots from Lapland. That’s the part of Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Russia that is north of the Arctic Circle. These boots are very warm.
See how the toes turn up? That’s to help people walk through the snow. The boots tie around your ankle to keep the snow out and the heat in.
Near the end of her trip, Grandma went to Australia. My cowboy boots came from there. Did you know cowboy boots are pointed at the toes? That is so cowboys and cowgirls can easily slip their feet into saddle stirrups.
Cowboy boots are tall to protect cowboys from cactuses and snakes. I hope Grandma did not run into any snakes in Australia!
Last, Grandma sent me some sandals from West Africa. It’s very hot there. That’s why these sandals have such thick soles. Thick soles protect your feet from the hot ground. Also, sandals let air move around your feet to keep you cool.
People around the world wear different kinds of shoes. They wear different shoes at different times. They wear different shoes for different reasons. Just like me!",674.0

Principal Lopez started to explain the rules for the spelling bee, but Jasmine wasn’t listening. What kinds of words would she have to spell? I probably should have studied the word list Mr. Russo gave the class, she thought.
Jasmine sat onstage with the other spelling champs. Her hands were sweating. As Principal Lopez introduced each of the spellers, their classes cheered. When she said Jasmine’s name, most students in Mr. Russo’s class clapped. Jasmine saw Finn glaring at her.
The first students spelled their words correctly. Jasmine knew some of them, but not all of them. Finally, it was her turn.
“Your word is caterpillar, ” said Principal Lopez. Jasmine’s heart sank. She had never spelled this word before. She tried to sound it out. “Caterpillar. C-A-T,” Jasmine paused. “E-R-P,” she continued, but she wasn’t sure what came next. “I-L-E-R,” she finished. “I’m sorry, but that’s wrong,” Principal Lopez said.
Jasmine returned to her chair. That was it. She was out on her first word. Yesterday she was sure she could win. Jasmine looked out and spotted Finn. Now I know how he felt, she thought.
Later, Jasmine opened the classroom door quietly, hoping to slip in. “Way to go, Jasmine!” Lilly said. “Yeah, bad luck on that word,” Finn added.
“You’re not mad at me?” Jasmine asked. “I said such mean things yesterday. I’m really sorry.” “It’s all right,” Finn replied. “Besides, it was really brave to go against those fifth graders,” he said. “Thanks, Finn. Now I understand how you felt yesterday. It is okay to fail, but it’s not okay to be mean about it,” Jasmine said. “You never know how others feel until you’re in their shoes,” she added. Finn looked at his shoes and laughed.",545.0
" It wasn’t nice at all. It was the coming of an ice age.
It wasn’t long before it began to get cold and colder and colder. The Theropods could see great mounds of ice—glaciers—creeping down from the mountains. “We must move from here,” said the Theropods. “We must escape to someplace warmer.” And with little thought or planning, they began moving away from the ice.
But the Tinosaurs were too small to escape. Their legs were too short and they could never run far enough. “What are we to do?” one Tinosaur asked another. “If we stay here, we will be covered with ice!” They thought and thought. Big plans for little creatures.
“We must find some place to stay warm,” one finally said to another. “A place where we can hide from the ice,” the other said in return. “I have an idea!” said the first one. He quickly told them of his plan. “Follow me!” With that, he searched about and found a large walnut shell. The other Tinosaurs did the same.
They ate the meat inside until there were only hollow shells left. Then, one by one, they each climbed inside a shell. They twisted and curled themselves inside and then pulled the top down tight.
Safe and warm in the hard shells, they fell fast asleep. They slept as the earth turned cold. Sadly, all the other dinosaurs became extinct during the ice age. The Tinosaurs slept and slept, waiting for the ice to melt. And, in time, it did.
After the ice melted and the days became warm, all over the world Tinosaurs crawled out of their walnut shells. But to this day, some Tinosaurs remain asleep in their shells. If you are lucky, some day you may crack open a walnut shell and there find a Tinosaur, fast asleep.",570.0

“Why don’t you do your homework?” she suggested. “I finished it at school,” he answered. “Okay, clean your room,” she suggested. In fifteen minutes, Elton’s room was clean and he was still wearing his unhappy face. For an outside boy, winter was a terrible time of year.
Just then the doorbell rang—it was Penelope, Elton’s friend and next-door neighbor. “Elton, would you like to come outside and make a snowperson with me?” Penelope asked. Elton wrinkled his nose. He didn’t like snow, and he didn’t like winter.
“Yes, yes, Elton would like to go,” his mother said. She bundled him up and sent him and his unhappy face outside with Penelope. Penelope and Elton made the largest snowperson anyone had ever seen. Then they made the tiniest snowperson anyone had ever seen.
“At dinnertime, Elton came inside and his unhappy face was almost gone. But the next morning, it was back again. “I don’t like snow, and I don’t like winter,” said Elton. Elton’s mother sighed. Just then the doorbell rang again—it was Penelope. “Elton, would you like to go snowshoeing?” asked Penelope, holding two pairs of snowshoes. Elton wrinkled his nose but said, “Sure, I guess so.”
Elton and Penelope strapped on the snowshoes and went stomping through the trees behind the house. At lunchtime, Elton came inside without his unhappy face. He told his mom all about the adventures he and Penelope had had in the snow. Just then the doorbell rang—it was Penelope.
“Elton, would you like to go sledding?” she said. This time Elton didn’t wrinkle his nose. Instead he grabbed his coat and yelled to his mom, “I’ll be home at dinnertime, with a happy face.”

Tía Teresa’s gravestone was piled with flowers, sweet pan de muertos , and candles. Someone began setting off fireworks. Mamá smiled to herself.
“I have a story about your Tía Teresa,” Mamá said to me. “One day, Teresa heard a tiny squeak coming from some tall grass. It was a little gray kitten. She was so small that Teresa named her Ratona.”“When Teresa died, I took Ratona home,” Mamá continued. “You were just a baby, María, but you loved her right away. Seeing you with Ratona reminded me of Teresa.”
Everyone in the graveyard was laughing and dancing. I was too young to remember Tía Teresa, but we had both loved Ratona. That made me happy. That was what Día de los Muertos was all about. Mamá took my hand and stood up. “I think it’s time to dance!” she said.",517.0
" They come out when the soil is warm and wet enough for them to survive.
Earthworms build long tunnels underground. The tunnels protect worms from heat and sunlight. The tunnels also help earthworms hide from hungry animals. If a bird attacks, an earthworm can pull back into its tunnel to get away.
Earthworms don’t have ears, but they can sense tiny movements in the ground. They don’t have eyes, but special parts of their skin can sense light. They avoid bright light. Earthworms are sometimes called night crawlers because they come out at night to look for food. They use their mouths to pull dead leaves and plants into their tunnels to eat later.
Farmers love earthworms! When earthworms dig tunnels, they make space in the soil. The space helps plants get what they need to grow. Earthworms also put organic matter, such as rotting leaves, into the soil. Organic matter acts like a sponge. It soaks up water, so soil stays wet longer.
Earthworms also put nutrients into the soil. The nutrients are in their waste, or castings. Castings make excellent fertilizer. In a garden smaller than most classrooms, earthworms make 170 pounds (77 kg) of castings every year. That’s like fifteen bowling balls’ worth of worm waste!
Some people raise earthworms on worm farms. The earthworms eat food scraps, turning them into rich soil. Both earthworms and their castings can be sold to gardeners to improve their soil. Earthworms are also sold for fishing bait.
Wanted: Earthworms!
Farmers aren’t the only ones who love earthworms. Moles, rats, and toads love juicy night crawlers. They love to eat them! Fish think earthworms are tasty, too. Earthworms are an important food source for these and other animals.

Elephants are herbivores (UR-beh-vores), or plant eaters, and they like many kinds of food. They eat grass, leaves, bark, branches, fruit, flowers, and seeds. Elephants are always on the move, looking for food and water. They eat so much that they can’t stay in one place for very long. When they leave an area, the plants have time to grow back.
Sometimes three or more families of elephants join together to form a herd. A herd may travel together to look for food and water. Elephants often walk in single file with each family following its matriarch. They follow the same routes year after year as they move from place to place.
Elephants need to drink water, just like people. Because they live in hot places, they also need water to cool off. Elephants like to give themselves showers. They also like to roll in mud or cover themselves with dust. Elephant skin may look tough, but it’s really very sensitive. Mud and dust help protect an elephant’s skin from insect bites and the Sun’s heat.
I was sad to learn that both kinds of elephants are endangered. Even though it is against the law, people kill elephants for their tusks. The tusks are made of ivory, which people use to make jewelry and pieces of art. People also change a lot of wild land into farms, which leaves some elephants with no place to live.
Many people around the world are trying to save elephants. Some countries have created special parks to protect elephants. Hunters are less likely to kill elephants that live in the parks than ones that live in the wild. Elephants are amazing animals. I hope people can help these gentle giants stay alive for a very long time.",681.0
" Their slim legs seemed so small, and their great heads and chests seemed so big. Now the leaders let every man ride as fast as he could.
All the men dashed ahead, trying to catch the buffaloes. Wind-in-the-Treetops’s pony was fast. It carried him along with the lead hunters. He was dangerously close to the terrified buffaloes.
Surrounded on all sides, the buffaloes tried to fight their way out of the circle. But the men shot with wonderful strength and swiftness. One great beast after another fell wounded or dead. The men let them lie and continued their chase. They knew that the rest of the tribe was close behind. Each woman would claim the buffalo shot by her husband or son.
Wind-in-the-Treetops rode on until he had shot the very last arrow from his quiver. The last of the buffaloes had disappeared from view. He turned back very slowly. His pony was tired. He was tired, too. He was so tired that he could hardly hold up his head. All the way back, he saw women skinning buffaloes and cutting up the meat.
Pretty soon he saw his younger brother shouting, leaping, and waving his skinning knife. His mother was bending over a huge buffalo with her knife. Wind-in-the-Treetops sprang from his pony. He forgot all about being tired.
“Did I kill it, Mother?” he cried. “Did I kill it?” “Yes,” said his mother. “Here is your arrow, which I pulled from it. We will have meat for the winter and fine, warm fur. I am very proud that my son has become a great hunter.”

" He almost didn’t hear the thin groans coming from a roadside ditch.
An old man with torn clothes was lying in the dust. “Water!” he cried feebly. The boy ran to the well, filled his jug, and brought the man some water. The man drank his fill. “I am a trader, but robbers stole my goods,” he said. Two frightened horses stood by the trees. The boy held out the water jug for them, and they drank until they were calm.
“You can have my jug to trade,” the boy offered. “For your kindness, take one of my horses,” urged the trader. “What a rich gift!” the boy said. He climbed on the horse and rode happily down the street.
He passed a group of men sitting in the shade of a fig tree. They were beautifully dressed, but they looked miserable. “What’s the matter?” asked the boy. One young man said, “I’m going to my wedding, where this band will play. But if I show up on foot, my bride will laugh at me.”
The boy hopped off the horse and handed the reins to the young man. “I have lived my whole life without a horse. You need it more than I do!” The musicians leaped up and sang. As they danced down the road, the last musician stopped. “Thank you for being so kind,” he said. He handed the boy a beautiful drum.
The boy shouted with joy. He tapped, slapped, and banged his drum the whole way home. Mother came out to see what the noise was. The boy told her the story of the stick, the roti, the jug, the horse, and the drum.

" “Stay here quietly,” she said before joining a group of teachers who were huddled around the slide.
Aja and the class waited and waited. What is taking so long? they wondered. Finally Ms. McBride came back to the class. “We can go back inside now. It seems to have been a false alarm,” she said.
As they walked back inside the building, Aja saw something strange in the hallway outside their classroom. She pulled on Sammy’s shirttail until he stopped. “Why is there a chair pushed up against the wall by the fire alarm?” she asked. “I bet that’s why the teachers looked upset. Maybe a student pulled the alarm.”
Before Sammy could answer, they heard excited shouts coming from the classroom. “Aja! Aja! Quick, come see! Look at your desk!” Aja and Sammy rushed into their room. Wrapped around Aja’s desk were rows and rows of glittering paper shamrocks. The top of her desk was covered with a gigantic green bow. All the other desks were untouched just as they had been before the fire bell had rung.
Aja did not know what to say. She knew no one had been in the room while they were outside. Fire bells were serious, and the teachers had counted everyone on the playground. Even Ms. McBride seemed speechless for a minute as she stared at Aja’s desk. “I wonder who…” she started to say, but then stopped. “Strange things seem to be happening this St. Patrick’s Day.”
Aja touched the beautiful bow on her desk. “It couldn’t have been you this time, Ms. McBride. My sister must have been wrong,” said Aja softly.

We’re just like planets, only we share our orbits with other objects.” Pluto made a face. “You mean the junk?” Eris laughed. “It’s just frozen gases and rocks left over from when the solar system began.”
“There sure is a lot of it,” Pluto griped. “Especially in the Kuiper Belt,” said Eris. “That’s our neighborhood. Scientists study the Kuiper Belt for clues about how the solar system began.” “Are they studying us, too?” Pluto asked. “Yes!

Eris and Pluto rolled out of their orbits. They zoomed over to where Makemake, Haumea, and Ceres had gathered together to meet them. In their excitement, they all started talking at once. “I have an idea,” said Pluto. “Let’s get to know each other with a game.”
They played Brag and Tag for hours and hours. Pluto was “tagged” a dozen times or more. Meanwhile, he learned that Eris took the longest time to orbit the Sun, and Ceres took the shortest.

" They look at the harm caused by a tornado. They use the amount of harm to estimate the wind speed.They use a special scale called the EF Scale.The EF Scale measures the strength of the tornado.
Tornadoes may be hard to measure, but scientists have a good idea where they’ll strike. It’s true that a tornado can hit anywhere in the world at any time. Most tornadoes happen in the central part of the United States. This area is called Tornado Alley.
More than one thousand tornadoes strike Tornado Alley each year.
There is no way to be sure that a tornado will strike. The National Weather Service (NWS) tries to help people stay safe during tornadoes. If they put out a tornado watch, a tornado might strike. If they put out a tornado warning, a tornado has been spotted.
If there is a tornado warning, it’s important to get to a safe place. Go indoors. The safest place is a basement. If you can’t get to a basement, go into a closet or bathroom. Stay away from windows.
The spinning air in a tornado makes things fly around. This can be dangerous. It’s always important to protect your head. You should get close to the ground. Go under a desk or table. You can even lie down in a bathtub.
It is not safe to stay in a mobile home in a tornado. If you are in a tall building, go to the stairs. If you are in a car, wear your seatbelt and lean forward. If you are outside, lie down on the ground.

A better kind of shadow clock was called a sundial. Sundials had a pointer and a base. The pointer cast a shadow on marks around the base. People could tell time by reading the marks. But shadow clocks were not good for telling time on cloudy days—or at night.
One kind of clock that didn’t need the sun was a water clock. A water clock was a container with a tiny hole in the bottom. Water would steadily drip out of the hole. Marks on the inside of the container showed the time. It took one hour for the water to go down one mark.
Another kind of clock that didn’t need the sun was a candle clock. You would know the time by how much of the candle had melted. The candle had marks down its side to show the hours.
Sometimes people used candle clocks as alarm clocks. They put a nail in the candle at the time they wanted to wake up, hanging a shoe on the nail. When the candle melted down, the nail fell out and the shoe hit the floor with a BANG!
Now there are all kinds of timepieces, from tall grandfather clocks to watches we wear on our wrists. Most clocks run on electricity from batteries.
Many clocks have two hands that point to numbers in a circle on the clock face. These are called analog clocks. Other clocks don’t have hands, only numbers. These are called digital clocks.
Inside one kind of analog clock is a carved bird called a cuckoo. Every hour, the door opens and the bird pops out and sings its song: cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo!

“Come here, my boy, and try on this shoe,” the coach said. The twins guffawed, but when the shoe slipped on perfectly, they both gasped, “Cinderello!” Mateo looked at the twins and said, “My name is Mateo.” “Mateo will be our captain, and he will lead us to victory!” the coach announced. Turning to the brothers, the coach added, “And you two will be our towel boys!”",576.0

“I don’t look at people anyway,” Cy said. “Everyone stares at my one eye.’” “Imagine having a head full of snakes,” Medusa said. “I guess,” Cy said. “The truth is, I don’t see well, but I don’t want to wear my monocle.”
Cy pulled a round glass piece on a chain from his pocket. “How silly is this?” he said. “It makes me stand out even more.” “Can I see that for a second?” Medusa asked. “Sure,” Cy said as he gave her the monocle. “I won’t be using it anyway.”
The school bell rang, and Medusa patted Cy on his shoulder. “I like your one eye,” Medusa said. “We need to get to shop class before we’re late.” Cy smiled. “Hey, shop class...” he said. “That gives me an idea.”
For the next two weeks in shop class, Cy and Medusa sat together. Cy worked on building a visor that would keep Medusa from turning people to stone. Finally, Cy handed the visor to Medusa, and she slipped it on. Inside, mirrors allowed her to look at people without making direct eye contact with anybody.
Medusa sneaked toward another table. The students looked at her, and no one turned to stone. “You did it!” Medusa yelled. She rushed back to the table and pulled something from a drawer. “I’ve been working on your monocle,” she said.
She handed the monocle to Cy. Medusa had wrapped the glass with wire and attached it to a leather strap carved with lightning bolts. “Wow,” Cy said, slipping it over his head. “Thanks! Now this I’d actually like to wear.”
“No problem,” Medusa said. “Thank you for helping me.” When the bell rang, Medusa and Cy headed out together. For the first time, neither of them stared at the ground.",559.0

Most eggs hatch into a worm-like stage called a larva. Caterpillars, grubs, and maggots are larvae (LAR-vee). They have long bodies and many legs. Almost all larvae are eating machines. A larva can eat more than its own body weight in one day.
Many larvae can destroy crops. Some larvae suck sap from crop roots. Others devour the leaves. Others eat fruits or vegetables. Beetle larvae can weaken and kill trees. Some moth larvae eat wool clothing. On the other hand, the silkworm, a moth larva, makes silk thread.
Once the larva has grown, it must totally change its shape. And it must protect itself while it does so. Many larvae spin cocoons out of silk or grow hard shells. The pupa does not eat and does not move much. But inside, the insect is very busy changing shape. This change is called metamorphosis (MET-ah-MORF-oh-sis).
After the metamorphosis is complete, the pupa hatches as an adult. The adult insect has wings, six legs, and three body parts. Many larvae that lived in water will hatch into adults that live on land. Larvae that lived underground will hatch above the soil. Adult insects will find mates, and the females will lay eggs. Sometimes, this is all the adults do. Mayfly adults live for only one day. Most other insects have longer adult lives. They eat, fly, hunt, and work.
In the three-stage life cycle, eggs do not hatch as larvae. They hatch as nymphs, which look like small adults. Some nymphs do not have full wings. Others, such as the dragonfly nymph, may live underwater.
Nymphs do not turn into pupae. Instead, they shed their skin as they grow. Each time they shed their skin, they look more like an adult. Slowly, the nymph transforms into an adult.",635.0
"” “Good work!” said Dad. “The next step is a petition.”
Dad and Mom showed Jenny and Joey how to write a petition. The petition stated the reasons for adding stop signs. People could sign the petition if they agreed. “You’ll need signatures from the majority of people in the neighborhood,” said Dad.
“What does majority mean?” asked Jenny. “It means more than half of the people,” explained Dad. Over the next week, Joey, Jenny, Ruben, and Rebecca talked to people in the neighborhood. Many people signed their petition, but some did not.
“The city council has a meeting next week,” Joey said to Mrs. Murphy. “My dad asked if our stop sign request could be put on the agenda.” “We’ll bring our petition, photos, and the traffic counting we did, too,” said Rebecca.
Friends, family, and neighbors were at the city council meeting. “I’m nervous,” whispered Ruben. “Me, too,” Joey agreed. When their names were called, Joey, Jenny, Ruben, and Rebecca stood at the microphone.
Joey talked about the need for the stop signs. Jenny and Rebecca showed their petition. “These are the photos we took of people trying to cross the street,” said Ruben. “This is Lucy, a dog that was hit by a car.”
When they finished, neighbors took turns speaking. Everyone said stop signs were needed. “Thank you for your hard work,” said the city council president. “We’ll discuss this and vote in two weeks.”
Joey, Jenny, Ruben, and Rebecca waited the long two weeks. One day, there was a phone call. “The city council voted YES!” said Jenny.
A few months later, workers put up the stop signs. There was a story and a photo in the newspaper about what the kids had accomplished. “Our street sure is safer now,” said Joey. “Woof!” Lucy agreed.",565.0

“It’s Red,” called Wolf in a high, sweet voice. “Lift the latch and come in,” called out Grandma. Wolf lifted the latch, went straight to Grandma’s bed, and swallowed her whole. Then he dressed himself in her clothes, pulled on her cap, and climbed into her bed.
When Red had picked enough flowers, she set out again for Grandma’s house. The door was open when she arrived. Red went straight to the bed, where she saw a very strange sight, indeed.
“Oh Grandma,” Red cried, “what big ears you have!” “All the better to hear you with, child,” Wolf said. “Oh Grandma,” Red cried, “what big eyes you have!” “All the better to see you with, child,” Wolf said. “Oh, Grandma,” Red cried, “what a big, terrible mouth you have!” “All the better to eat you with!” Wolf roared.
With one bound, he leaped out of bed and swallowed up Red—flowers, cake, and all. Then Wolf lay down again on the bed and drifted off to sleep. It was dark inside Wolf, but Red managed to reach down and squeeze Grandma’s hand. Grandma squeezed back.
Red could make out a weak light leaking down Wolf’s throat. He was snoring with his mouth open.Inch by inch, Red lifted her bunch of flowers. She tickled Wolf’s throat until he started to cough. She tickled Wolf’s throat—once, twice, thrice. He coughed once, twice, thrice. She kept on tickling until he coughed her up. When at last he did, Red held tight to Grandma’s hand and pulled her out, too.

“Oh, yes!” said Maria. Her aunt set Ruben on Maria’s lap. “His smile is like yours,” Maria’s abuela said.
Later that evening, Maria and her family attended church. They held candles and sang Christmas songs in Spanish and English.
Maria noticed Mr. Lewis sitting alone at church. Maria remembered that his only son lived far away.
“Could we invite Mr. Lewis to Christmas dinner tomorrow?” she asked after church. “That’s a great idea,” said Maria’s mother. Her father agreed.
The next morning, Maria and her cousins woke early. Ruben crawled right to the presents under the tree. Maria laughed. “How did you know this one’s for you?”
All the gifts were opened except one. “That’s for my friend, Carlos,” Maria explained. “He’s celebrating Navidad with his family in Mexico. They’ll open gifts on Three Kings Day, January 6th. Then he and his family will fly back here.”
Everyone had a job to do to get ready for Christmas dinner. Maria and her cousins decorated placemats for the table. Her father made meatball soup. Her abuela and mother made tamales. A turkey roasted in the oven, too.

" People called the men “sky boys.”
Sky boys worked in teams of four to join the beams together with red-hot rivets. Every team member was brave and fast. The steel beams zoomed up an amazing four floors a week. Some of the best teams were Mohawk Indians from New York State. Some of them could set a rivet every minute.
By June, the steel reached the twenty-fifth floor. Behind the sky boys came other workers. They built the outside wall of the building. These workers were so fast that they started to catch up to the sky boys.
August was the busiest month. The sky boys were almost to the top. The outside wall made of stone, windows, and metal was going up a floor a day. Inside, thousands of workers were busy.
Getting supplies to so many workers was taking too much time. Workers laid tracks around each floor to speed things up. Carts were loaded and pushed along the tracks right to the workers.
In November, Al Smith stood proud. He was on the 102nd floor. The steel beams had reached the very top. He was also scared standing that high up on a beam. The last rivet was placed. When he smashed it into the beam, the steel work was done! That rivet made newspaper headlines. Not only was it the last one set, but it was also the only one made of gold.
Happy Birthday!
The building opened on May 1, 1931. Fifty years later, in 1981, the building was made a landmark. It is protected by law and cannot be torn down. Al Smith said his building was made for the future, and he was right! It will be standing tall in New York for a long time to come.",584.0

Suddenly, the train got very loud and everything became pitch dark. “It’s a tornado!” cried Speedy Legs. “ We’re caught in a thunderstorm,” said Fluffy Tail. “ I think there was an explosion,” said Floppy Ears.
Snubby Nose got so scared that he began to cry. The other Hoppers were afraid, too. “ Don’t worry, Snubby Nose,” said Grandpa Grizzly. “We’re just going through a tunnel.” But it was so dark and the train roared so loudly that Snubby Nose was still afraid. “ The tunnel won’t hurt you, Snubby Nose,” said Grandpa Grizzly.
Grandpa Grizzly reached into his bag, took something out, and put it around Snubby Nose’s head. Then he put something on his own head. He flipped a switch, and a bright light shone from Snubby Nose’s forehead. Then a light shone from Grandpa Grizzly’s forehead. Grandpa Grizzly gave all the Hoppers their own head lamps.
“Let’s pretend we’re miners in the tunnel,” said Grandpa Grizzly. “ Finally, Snubby Nose stopped crying, and the other Hoppers weren’t afraid anymore. The Hoppers went up and down the dark train with their head lamps on. Soon they saw a little light from a sign that said “Snack Car.”

" Without plants, what would hawks do for food?
Summer is playtime. For the leaves of many trees, however, it’s work, work, work! The Sun is shining. The leaves are making sugar from water, carbon dioxide, and sunlight.
What do the leaves do with the sugar? They send it to the tree’s roots, branches, and buds. Those parts store sugar so the tree will have food during the cold months.
Leaves are green in summer because they are full of chlorophyll. Leaves also have orange, yellow, or brown chemicals inside them. Those chemicals are there in summer, but the green chlorophyll hides them.
In places far from Earth’s equator, the temperature gets cooler in fall. The days get shorter, and the nights get longer. Trees get less sunlight, so photosynthesis slows down. Over time, leaves stop making chlorophyll, so they lose their green color. The hidden orange, yellow, and brown colors start to show. Leaves also start making a red chemical at this time.
When the weather gets cold enough in fall, the temperature drops below freezing. Since tree sap contains a lot of water, it can freeze. A tree’s roots, trunk, and branches protect the sap from freezing. However, leaves are very thin. If they freeze, the tree will be hurt. Trees drop their leaves to keep themselves safe. They close off the opening at the bottom of each leaf’s stem. Soon afterward, the leaves fall off.
Trees that drop their leaves are bare in winter. They use the stored food to get through the cold days and colder nights. Spring comes before long. Ice and snow melt, and the rains come. The Sun shines, and tiny leaves sprout from branches. Once again, the leaves use water, chlorophyll, carbon dioxide, and sunlight to make food. The cycle begins again.",593.0
" “Rapunzel! Rapunzel! Let down your hair!” she called, her voice barely rising above the storm. “Hurry, my love!” Rapunzel called back, thinking that her prince, not the witch, was climbing up to her. “We must escape before the witch returns.”

She climbed to the tower room in a rage, pulling harshly on Rapunzel’s hair. “ Wretched girl!” she cried. “Is this how you thank me for caring for you and keeping you from harm all these years?” She grabbed a pair of scissors and cut off Rapunzel’s hair. “Now, you will never betray me again!” she said furiously.
She dragged Rapunzel to the bottom of the tower and blasted the stones away from the door. “I banish you,” she said, and sent Rapunzel into the dark forest. Then the witch waited for the prince inside the tower. When he came, she let him climb up using the hair she had cut from Rapunzel’s head.
In the tower, the prince came face to face with the witch. “You tried to steal my most precious treasure,” the witch said to him. “Now you will never see her again. I curse you to blindness.” The prince’s sight vanished. She dragged him out of the tower and sent him into the forest. “You will never find her in there, Prince!” she cackled after him.
Heartbroken and unable to see, the prince stumbled through the forest for days. On the morning of the third day, he heard a voice he knew, singing sadly. “Rapunzel!” he cried. “Is that you?”

" Some snakes can sense the heat of animals nearby. Pits near the snake’s eyes sense heat. These snakes can tell how far away something is in the dark when they hunt.
Snakes are meat eaters. Some snakes inject venom when biting prey. Other snakes squeeze prey to death. Some snakes swallow prey alive. Most snakes’ jaws are loosely connected. This lets snakes open their mouth wide to swallow large prey. Snakes’ fangs and other teeth point backward, helping push food toward their throat. Snakes have a breathing tube that they push out of their mouth. This lets them breathe when they swallow prey. Muscles move it to the stomach. Stomach acids turn prey into liquid so the snake can digest it easier.
Most female snakes that live in cold areas lay eggs in late spring or early summer. Snakes that live in warmer areas may mate at any time of year. Baby snakes may grow sharp teeth to cut through the eggs. Once they hatch, they must survive on their own and face many dangers. Some female snakes keep eggs inside their body until they hatch. Then they give birth to live babies.
Venom is a dangerous liquid. Some snakes inject venom when they bite with their fangs. Venom is made in sacs behind the snake’s eyes. It flows through the snake’s fangs from these sacs.
Snakes use venom to defend and attack. Snakes usually inject more venom when biting in defense. The venom paralyzes their prey. Some snakes inject venom and let the prey go. Then they follow the prey until it dies. Other snakes use their teeth or body to hold on to prey until it dies. Then they eat it.
Snakes are amazing hunters. They have survived almost everywhere. Snakes are unusual animals that play an important role in our environment.",620.0

Jesse opened his fortune cookie next. You will lose something you care about. “I hope it’s not my skateboard,” he said. Then Emma opened up her cookie. The message inside said: Trees keep secrets under their leaves. “Trees don’t have secrets,” Emma laughed.
“Let’s get one for Sparky so we can find out his fortune,” said Jesse. “Sure,” said Dad. “After all, he’s a member of our family now.” Jesse asked for another fortune cookie when he asked for a leftover container. Jesse mixed the leftovers together while Emma opened Sparky’s cookie. It read: Those around you will be busy while you are at rest. Huh? thought Emma. “I wonder what that means.” Emma stuffed all the fortunes in her pocket.
As soon as the family got home, they discovered Sparky was missing. Emma had a sick feeling in her stomach. Emma knew it was her fault. She had forgotten to lock the back gate. The family began to search everywhere they thought the puppy might go.
Mom called all of the neighbors. Dad drove around in the family car. Jesse rode his skateboard to the park. But, after an hour, they hadn’t found the puppy.

“Have you heard of Microraptor ?” asked Jae. “They’re tiny, but speedy...” Chattering together, they went outside to recess. “Do you want to hang out at the park after school?” Jae asked her. Martina agreed. After school, they spent several hours at the park talking about dinosaurs and tossing Jae’s favorite baseball around. Martina’s pretty cool, Jae thought as he went home. And it’s pretty cool that she likes the same book that I lost.
The next morning was Saturday, and Jae wanted to do some throwing drills. When he looked for his baseball, he had a familiar sinking feeling. He couldn’t find it. “Can we go to the park to look for my baseball?” Jae asked his mom.
At the park, they heard a rustling sound coming from behind a bush. Curious, Jae peered over it and saw a thin-looking puppy without a collar or tags. The stray puppy was chewing hungrily on something round. Jae looked closer. It was his baseball! “Mom, look!” Jae said, picking up the puppy very gently. “Doesn’t he look like he needs a home?” His mother smiled, watching them. “Yes, he does,” she said. “He’ll be your responsibility, though.” Jae nodded excitedly and hugged the puppy closer.
What a week! Jae thought to himself, walking home with the puppy in his arms. I’ve lost homework, my keys, my book, my baseball... He paused as he realized something. Almost every time he had lost something, he had gained a friend.

"It’s a moonlit night. A dark shape floats over you and into the trees. It’s an owl!
More than two hundred different kinds of owls live around the world. The way they look and act helps them survive.
Owls can’t move their eyes, so they turn their heads. Owls can turn their heads almost all the way around. They can even turn their heads upside down!
Owls have big eyes, but they can’t see in total darkness. They see better in low light than most animals, though. That’s because of their pupils—the black circles in the center of their eyes. Their pupils can grow large to let in more light.
Most owls use their hearing to hunt. Owls have huge ears. On most owls, one ear is higher than the other. Owls can hear prey that’s hiding in grass or snow.
Barn owls can hear a mouse and catch it in complete darkness. Barn owls have the best hearing of any animal.
Owls must attack by surprise if they want to eat. The soft feathers that cover their bodies help them fly without a sound.
The main food for most owls is small animals—lots of them. In its lifetime, a barn owl may eat 11,000 mice!
Some owls can live in many different places. Other owls cannot.
Spotted owls can only survive in old forests with huge trees. Many of these forests have been cut down. Today, few spotted owls are left.
People don’t see owls very often, but they are out there. Go out at sunset and listen for their calls. If you stay out too late, people might think you’re an owl. A night owl, that is.",575.0

Canada has only one neighbor, the United States. Ottawa is the country’s capital. The city’s buildings are fun to visit.
Nearly all Canadians speak French, English, or both. People come from far-away countries to live in Canada.
Together, all of these different people make Canada strong. Most Canadians live in big cities in the south of Canada. Few people live in the far north.
Canada has many different landforms. In the west are rows of steep mountains. Then there are flat or rolling plains. A high flat area with thousands of lakes is in the middle.
The land in the south is where most of the cities are. In the east are hills. In the north, the land is covered with ice and snow.
Some animals live only in the cold north. Others live only in the mountains or forests. Polar bears and baby harp seals live in the north. They both have white fur to hide on the snow.
Big sheep live in the mountains. They have feet that help them climb rocks. Many animals in Canada move in winter and spring. Canada geese fly south every winter. They return in the spring when it is warmer.
All across Canada, people celebrate winter. There are festivals for ice-skating and ice carving. There are dogsled races across the snow.

One player on each team is the bowler. The bowler throws a ball to a batter on the other team.
The bowler tries to hit three small posts in the ground near the batter. These posts are called stumps. At the top of the stumps are two small pieces of wood called bails. Together, the stumps and bails are called a wicket. If the bowler’s ball knocks the bails off the wicket stumps, the batter is out.
The batter protects the wicket by hitting the ball with his or her bat.If the batter hits the ball, he or she runs down the pitch.If the batter swaps places with the other batter, he or she scores one point. The point is called a run.
Nine players on the bowling team play in the field. Their job is to get the balls that the batter hits.They can get the batter out by catching the ball. They can also throw the ball and hit the wicket to get an out. After ten outs, the bowling team gets their turn at bat.At the end of the game, the team with more runs wins.

Uncle Jason gives me a tour. Just like my house, the fire station has a kitchen, but different people use it on different days. That’s because firefighters work long shifts. They’re on one day, then off two.
Next stop on the tour is Uncle Jason’s bedroom. It has a television, couch, and bed. After sleeping, Uncle Jason puts fresh sheets on the bed for the next firefighter.
Next, Uncle Jason shows me the day room. This is where the firefighters hang out after chores are done.
The most exciting part of the fire station is the garage. Two fire trucks are waiting, ready to go.
Uncle Jason usually drives the water truck. Its tank holds enough water to fill forty-eight bathtubs! They use the water in the truck whenever there’s no fire hydrant nearby.
On the truck is everything that firefighters need, including a snake box. Since we live in the desert, the fire station gets calls from people with snakes in their yards.
If the snakes are dangerous, firefighters catch them. The snakes are locked safely in the box. They’re let go later, far from any houses or businesses. Uncle Jason shows me a rattlesnake. It gives me the creeps, but it’s cool, too.
I get to put on the gear that firefighters wear in a fire. There’s a special coat, pants, a helmet, and an air tank. It’s like wearing a winter coat in the summer—heavy and hot.
Suddenly, there’s a call—it’s a fire! Later, Uncle Jason tells me about the call. He carried pets out of a house while the other firefighters put out the fire. They saved the day!
It’s time for me to go home for dinner. The firefighters start cooking their dinner, too. They’re like one big family!",584.0

“Like the idea you had for the squirrels?” his mom asked. Two weeks before, Sam tried to stop the squirrels from eating all the birdseed. He dug a pit around the bird feeder and ruined his mother’s tulips.
“This is different,” Sam said. “I promised you I’d draw all my ideas first before I actually do anything.” “We could move our trampoline under the tree so the bear could jump onto it,” Sarah suggested.
Sam drew the idea on his notepad. He pictured the bear bouncing high into the air. “I think the trampoline’s too bouncy, Sarah,” he said.
“Mom, what would you do to get the bear out of the tree?” Sarah asked. “I’d play a really bad song from the radio,” Mrs. Miller laughed.
Sam drew the idea on his notepad. He imagined the bear climbing even higher in the tree to get away from the noise. “If you play a bad song the bear will never come down,” Sam sighed.
“Look, the bear’s eating something up there,” Sarah said. “He’s probably found some nuts that were stashed away by squirrels,” Mrs. Miller said.
“I’ve got it!” Sam shouted. He scribbled his plan in the notepad and showed Sarah and his mom. “We can make a trail of nuts leading back to the forest,” Sam said. “Let’s get nuts!” Sarah yelled.
“All right, let’s try it,” Mrs. Miller Everyone raced to the chestnut tree in the backyard. “We’re going to get that bear out of the tree!” Sam shouted.
While they were gathering the chestnuts, the bear climbed down from the tree. Sam returned just in time to see the bear disappear into the woods behind the neighbors’ house.
“Aw, the bear is gone!” he said. “Look on the bright side,” Mrs. Miller said. “At least you can have the yard sale now,” she smiled.",680.0
"” People in Mexico have celebrated holidays like this one for thousands of years. All over the United States, people hold parades and celebrations. These usually take place around November 1 and 2.
Is It Halloween?
Día de los Muertos might seem like Halloween. The two holidays are different, though. Halloween is often about scaring people. Día de los Muertos is a time of joy. People remember and celebrate loved ones who have died.
Lidia Terán-Cooper grew up in Mexico. Lidia and her family spent every Día de los Muertos at the cemetery. The family brought flowers and a picnic.
Lidia lives in the United States now. Lidia and her family walk in the parade in Tucson (TOO-sawn), Arizona, every year.
Some places have a parade for children. Children decorate cardboard wings to wear. They paint their faces and put on costumes.
Día de los Muertos has many other traditions. Some people build altars in their homes. The altars are covered with cloth. The family puts up photos of the person who has died. They might add a favorite item or piece of clothing of the loved one.
The family lights candles around the altars. They also make special bread. They might even leave a favorite drink. Flowers, skeleton toys, and dolls also decorate the altars.
Some people make sugar skulls. People decorate the sugar skulls with colorful frosting. Children love eating the sweet skulls.
Some artists make paintings for the holiday. The paintings show skeletons dancing and playing music. The art is a way to celebrate friends and family members who have died.
Día de los Muertos helps people to feel better after losing someone they love. Marching in a parade or decorating altars can help them celebrate that special person. No other holiday is so full of life, costumes, masks, joy, memories, and love.",661.0
" It flows in rivers and streams, and it crashes as ocean waves.
Not all water is liquid. When liquid water gets very cold, it freezes to form ice. Ice is another state of water— solid water. Ice can float on liquid water. People form ice into different shapes. Artists even carve ice to make sculptures.
Much of Earth’s frozen water is at the North and South Poles, Earth’s coldest areas.
Some of Earth’s water is in an invisible state as a gas called water vapor. While it’s always invisible, water vapor is all around us.
Earth’s water is always changing from one state to another. When frozen water is heated, it melts and becomes liquid water. When liquid water is cooled, it freezes and becomes ice.
Liquid water can become a gas, too. Have you ever seen a puddle of water dry up on a hot day? Energy from the Sun changed the liquid to a gas in a process called evaporation. Water evaporates from oceans, rivers, lakes, and puddles all over the world.
When water vapor in the air cools down, it changes from a gas to a liquid. This process is called condensation. Clouds are made up of tiny drops of water formed by condensation. The tiny drops stick together, creating larger, heavier drops. Once they’re large enough, they fall to the ground as rain or another type of precipitation.
Rain keeps plants alive and allows them to keep growing. People and other animals need water to survive. We also use it for other purposes, such as fighting fires.
It is important to take care of Earth’s water. Keeping waste and trash away from water keeps it from becoming dirty and unusable. Polluted water makes people, plants, and animals sick. Would you want to drink and play in polluted water?",586.0
"Gorillas are members of the great ape family. They live in the forests of Africa. Gorillas have strong, heavy bodies. They can walk on two legs like people do. Most of the time they walk on their feet and hands.
Gorillas eat leaves, stems, bark, fruits, flowers, and wood. They also eat insects and snails. Most gorillas do not hunt.
Gorillas make faces to show how they feel. Their faces tell if they are happy, sad, or upset. Gorillas can cry, and they laugh when they are tickled.
A gorilla family is called a troop. A troop eats, sleeps, and plays together. Family members play tag, catch, and dress-up with leaves.
A gorilla baby nurses and stays close to its mother for a few years. It rides on her back to move around.
When a male gorilla grows up, the fur on its back turns silver. It is called a silverback. The silverback’s job is to protect the troop.
Gorillas are very smart. A woman named Penny taught a gorilla to use sign language. The gorilla’s name is Koko. Koko uses signs to tell Penny what she wants and how she feels.
Many gorillas have been killed by hunters. Their forest homes are being cut down. Gorillas are now endangered. Many people are trying to save these great apes.",558.0
" The tools tell us how high the balloon is and the temperature of the air. They also tell us where we are.
Interviewer: How do you steer?
Dan: The wind goes in different directions at different heights. We go up and down to find wind that goes the way we want to go. We fly just after sunrise or before sunset. That’s when the winds are best.
Interviewer: How do you make the balloon go up and down?
Dan: There is a hole at the top of the balloon. We can open and close it with a cord. To go down, we open the hole to let out hot air. To go up, we close the hole.
Interviewer: How high can you go?
Dan: Some people take balloons ten miles in the air. They have to wear oxygen tanks so they have enough air to breathe. But most stay within two miles of the surface.
Interviewer: How do you know where you are?
Dan: We use radio signals from satellites and then follow on a map.
Interviewer: How did you start flying hot-air balloons?
Dan: I fixed balloons before I flew them. My first flight was so much fun that I just kept doing it!
Interviewer: What is the longest trip you ever took in a balloon?
Dan: My longest balloon trip was 55 miles. I flew right up the Mississippi River. Some people go on much longer trips.
Interviewer: Is it dangerous to fly a hot-air balloon?
Dan: No, it’s a safe sport. A balloon is like a big pillow. We make sure the weather will be good before we fly so we stay safe.
Interviewer: Are you ever scared when you fly?
Dan: No, I find it exciting. I like flying best in the fall when the leaves are different colors. The scenery is beautiful from high in the air.",522.0
" Most Indian people live in the countryside. The cities do not have as many people. They are very crowded, though.
Around half of the people in India make their living from growing food. They grow crops or raise sheep, goats, and chickens for meat. They do not raise cows for meat. Most Indians are Hindu. Hurting a cow is against the Hindu religion.
India has many mountains and different kinds of flat land. The mountains are in the north. They are the highest in the world.
Rich land covers the north of India. It was formed long ago as rivers flooded over and over. In the west is the dry desert. In the south is raised, flat land. This land takes up more than half of India. In May or June every year, winds bring a large amount of rain. This is called the monsoon season. Most of India’s rain falls during this season.
People in India celebrate many special days. Diwali (dih-WAH-lee) lasts for five days. During this festival , people light small candles. They shoot firecrackers and give sweets to family and friends.
Holi (HOH-lee) is a spring Hindu festival. During Holi, people celebrate the end of winter. They throw colored water and powder on each other.
Many kinds of animals live in India. It is the only country in the world with both lions and tigers. Elephants live in the flat lands and forests. The mountains are home to bears, foxes, sheep, and wild goats.
India is also home to the world’s largest mangrove forest. Here, tigers swim with sea turtles, sharks, and crocodiles.

" Opossums pretend to be dead if an enemy is near. They stay still and let out stinky green slime.
Wolverines make a smelly liquid to keep other animals away from their home. They also pee on food they don’t eat right away. The smell may help them find the food later. It may also keep other animals from eating it.
Male musk oxen fight each other for females. Males use their stinky pee to tell other males to keep away. The pee sticks to their long belly hair and makes them smell terrible.
The stinkbird mainly eats leaves. Food goes to its crop (the area under its throat) before the stomach. Tiny living things there break down the leaves. This way of eating makes the stinkbird smell terrible.
Vultures eat animals that are dead and often rotten. When vultures are in danger, they throw up! The stuff they throw up is very smelly.
A type of beetle sprays a hot, stinky liquid from the back of its body. The spray can kill many enemies and burn people.
Millipedes (MILL-ih-peedz) can’t move fast. If an enemy bothers them, they curl up and give off a stinky liquid. Some millipedes can even shoot the smelly stuff!
The common musk turtle has another name—stinkpot! It smells bad when other animals disturb it. A stinky yellow liquid comes out of the back of its body. The mink frog also uses smell to stay safe from enemies. It smells like rotten onions.
Being stinky helps many plants and animals stay alive. For plants, the bad smell brings helpful insects. For animals, the bad smell may keep enemies away or help in other ways. Stinky steam, spray, throw-up, slime, and pee all help living things stay alive.",613.0

A tarantula is covered with hairs. The hairs sense heat, cold, and things that move. Other hairs near its mouth help a tarantula taste and smell. Stiff hairs with points grow on its stomach and back. A tarantula can sting enemies with these hairs.
The legs of a tarantula have little claws with hairs. The hairs help the tarantula hold on when it climbs. Two little arms near its mouth have sharp parts. The tarantula holds and cuts food with them.
Tarantulas rest during the day and come out at night to hunt. They eat insects, frogs, lizards, bats, mice, and small snakes. They also eat spiders—even other tarantulas.
To catch prey, a tarantula sits very still and waits. When an animal comes near, the tarantula jumps and jabs its fangs into it. Venom shoots into the animal and makes it stop moving.
The tarantula drags the animal back home. It uses its jaws and little arms to cut up the animal. It spits juices onto the pieces, which turn to mush. Then the tarantula sucks up a tasty meal.
You might think tarantulas are too big to be hunted. Not true! The tarantula hawk—a big wasp—hunts tarantulas as food for its young. A female wasp stings a tarantula, which then stops moving. The wasp lays one egg on the tarantula’s body. When the young insect comes out, it feeds on the tarantula.
How Safe Are Tarantulas?
Many people are scared of tarantulas because they are so big. Tarantulas are harmless if you leave them alone. Some tarantulas are slow and calm. Others are fast and looking for a fight, so don’t mess with them!
People are a bigger danger to tarantulas than any other threat. These amazing spiders are important to the balance of nature. They deserve to be protected.",565.0

As dragonflies grow, their skin doesn’t grow with them. Instead, young dragonflies shed their entire outer layer every time they need to grow. When a young dragonfly is ready to become an adult, it crawls out of the water. The last layer of skin splits open, and the adult dragonfly climbs out.
Adult dragonflies have the largest eyes of any kind of insect. Each eye is made up of about thirty thousand tiny pieces. They can see in almost all directions at once. Dragonflies’ super eyesight helps them catch prey.
Dragonflies can speed up faster than the world’s fastest race cars! Dragonflies are among the world’s fastest flying insects. Large dragonflies reach speeds greater than 22 miles (36 km) per hour.
Unlike most flying insects, dragonflies control each wing on its own. This skill lets them swoop and dive like fighter jets. They can fly forward, backward, and even upside down.
Adult dragonflies are high-speed flying hunters. They surprise mosquitoes and other small insects by attacking from behind and below. They kill their prey with a fast, powerful bite. Dragonflies often eat their catch without bothering to land.
Many animals like to eat dragonflies—birds, lizards, frogs, spiders, and even other dragonflies. Dragonflies’ flying skills help them avoid danger. Not many animals can catch these speedy insects. Humans eat dragonflies, too. In many parts of the world, dragonflies are a special treat. You can buy dragonflies on sticks for a snack.
Dragonflies sometimes travel in huge groups, called swarms. They travel in swarms for food and to go south for the winter.
There are nearly three thousand kinds of dragonflies. They are found all around the world, in almost every kind of habitat. Check out your closest stream, pond, or lake. See if you can spot them for yourself!",699.0

" It takes very little energy to keep hibernating animals alive.
Where Do Animals Hibernate?
Hibernating animals also need a safe place to sleep. They need to be away from the cold and hidden from hungry predators. Some animals, like bats, hibernate in caves.
Hibernating snakes sleep underground in burrows. Frogs and turtles sleep in mud at the bottom of ponds. Some mice hibernate in winter nests. Some animals, like squirrels, store food where they hibernate.
Many people think of bears when they think of hibernation. But a bear is not really a hibernating animal. A bear often wakes up and moves around in winter. Also, a bear’s body temperature doesn’t get as cold as that of other warm- blooded hibernating animals. The bear’s sleep is called torpor. A torpor is a deep sleep, but not as deep as hibernation.
Like a hibernating animal, though, a bear prepares a place to sleep for winter. It fills its winter den with leaves and tree branches. This bed helps keep the bear’s body heat in while it sleeps. Layers of snow on the den also keep the heat inside. This helps keep the bear warm.
Like birds, some butterflies fly to warmer areas in winter. But many insects hibernate. They need a safe, warm place to sleep just like other hibernating animals. Some hibernate in holes in the ground. Others hibernate under tree bark. Some insects, like many ladybugs, hibernate in buildings, including houses!
Who Hibernates?
Warm-blooded animals like groundhogs, chipmunks, and prairie dogs hibernate. Cold-blooded animals like snakes, frogs, turtles, insects, and lizards hibernate.
Some animals like bats, some squirrels, and some mice hibernate all winter long. Some animals wake up to eat, as bears do. Raccoons, badgers and skunks might wake up to eat on a warm winter day. In the spring, all the hibernating animals wake up.",672.0

I knock on Grandpa’s door, and I hear barking—I hear Patches! When Grandpa opens the door, Patches jumps up and licks my face. I hug her and pet her, and even rub her stomach just where she likes it.
When we get to Grandpa’s backyard, Grandpa asks me what happened. I tell him how I accidentally left the backyard gate open and how Patches got out—probably looking for food.
“ Can you explain how you forgot to feed her?” Grandpa asks. “ I started playing one of my video games, and I couldn’t get past this one part. When I realized Patches was gone, I was so worried.” “ How could a video game be more important than your dog?” Grandpa asks. “It’s not,” I say.

The crazy mice were just waxing their boards when I saw the beam of a flashlight searching our theater. A theater manager was looking for something... or somebody. My friends noticed the beam, too. I looked over at Derek, and his eyes were as wide as saucers. We heard the manager call, “Psst! Hey, you!” We didn’t dare turn to look. “Who, me?” a voice said.

" Electric eels can’t see well and are nocturnal, or most active at night. Electric eels send out small shocks—about fifty every second—to sense nearby plants and animals. When an electric eel senses prey, it sends out two or three big shocks. The shocks make the prey move, which helps the eel find it quickly. Then the electric eel sends out its attack shock, which stuns or kills the prey. The electric eel sucks the prey into its belly before the animal swims away. Electric eels mostly eat small fish or animals like frogs or shrimp. Young eels also eat worms and insects.
Don’t Swim There!
Electric eels are top predators that few other animals eat in the South American rivers where they live. They can also live in other types of nearby fresh water, such as ponds. Because they breathe air, electric eels can live in water that might kill other fish. They can also live out of water for hours if they stay wet.
Electric eels mostly lay eggs in small ponds. Male eels build bubble nests with their spit. Female eels lay eggs in the bubbles. Males protect the nest. They also protect the babies until they grow to about half as long as a pencil. The young eels only make small shocks, so they can become prey for other animals.
Scientists are still learning new things about electric eels. Some scientists want to use what they have learned about electric eels to make a new kind of battery. The battery could be used inside people, and it wouldn’t harm them or run out of power. Two hundred years ago, Humboldt wrote that scientists didn’t understand all the secrets of electric fish. That is still true today. What will electric eels help scientists learn next?",694.0

It was goopy chicken soup, a dried quesadilla, and many fruit cups. I removed it all from hidden corners. The worst was yet to come.
I found cherry tomatoes covered with black mold. Then I found a box of Caesar salad smelling of rotted fish and greens.

I wiped the goo on a tree. “What are you going to do?” “We will put in the beast only what we can take out. We will not fill the beast with leftovers that won’t be eaten. Those who do not follow the rules will receive no food from the beast, but must feed it all the same.”",546.0

I’m a little jealous,” Harmony whispered back. When the pair finished, they came into the room and sat down near Rhythm, Harmony, and their mom.
Everything was quiet except for the TVs. Rhythm started tapping on the chair next to him. The boy started nodding his head to the beat, and then he started humming a song. Harmony recognized it and started harmonizing while humming along. Before they knew it, they were both singing loudly. The boy’s sister pulled out her guitar, and Rhythm was slapping his hands on three chairs. When the song ended, everyone in the waiting room cheered. “I never thought I’d see you two playing together,” Mom said.
“We did sound pretty good,” Rhythm admitted. Harmony nodded in agreement. “Good? We sounded amazing!” the boy said. “I’m Mel, and this is my sister Tempo.” “Our parents are big music buffs,” Tempo said before whispering, “Mel is short for Melody .” “Don’t tell people that!” Mel said. Rhythm and Harmony introduced themselves, and they all had a good laugh about their names.
“We should jam again sometime. We’d make a great band,” Tempo suggested. The man with the clipboard came in and said the judges were announcing the winner. Everyone crowded around the televisions. Mr. Hackett was on stage. He opened an envelope and read: “The winner is . . . Springfield Country Band!” The audience exploded into cheers.
Rhythm, Harmony, Mel, and Tempo were smiling, even though they hadn’t “You guys want to come over sometime?” Rhythm asked. “Our basement would be a really great place for all of us to practice together,” Harmony said. Hearing this, Mom couldn’t help but smile.",625.0
" “This will do just fine,” he said as he put it on. “Tell you what, I’ll trade you.” He pulled the bandanna off his neck, reached down, and tied it around my neck. “Isn’t much,” he said, “but when you wear it, you’ll never forget me.”
He spun his horse, ready to ride away, but he stopped. Then he reached into his shirt pocket and pulled out a picture. “Give this to your grandma. Tell her there’s a note on the back.” He squeezed his legs, and the horse leaped into a gallop. Just like that, he was gone!
And just like that I woke up sitting on the couch with my book flopped over in my lap. My grandma woke up with a start. She looked over at me, smiling, and then her eyes got really big. “Where did you get that bandanna?” she asked. I reached up and grabbed the ends of a red bandanna that was tied around my neck.
It was then that I realized that I had a picture clutched in my right hand. I unfolded it. The picture was of a handsome man sitting on a horse. I gulped and handed it to my grandma, who had big tears in her eyes. I could just barely make out the writing on the back, which said, “I love you, Nettie. Always have, always will.”
Well, I’m back now, and I wear the bandanna every day so I won’t forget. Sarah and Sybil don’t believe my story. But who cares? They are liars and fibbers and tellers of untruth. My diary proves it!

A model rocket’s body is a long tube made of cardboard or plastic. The nose cone fits into the top of the tube. The size and shape of a rocket’s body and nose cone can change how it flies.
Fins help the rocket fly straight. The engine burns fuel to push the rocket into the air. A parachute helps the rocket fall safely back to Earth.
People like to make their rockets look great. Many people paint their rockets with different colors and designs. Every rocket is one of a kind!
The only place to launch a rocket is in an open space. The launch area needs to be far away from people and buildings. A large field or a playground is a good spot. First, set up the launchpad. Place the rocket over the guide wire on the pad. The guide wire keeps the rocket pointing straight up when it lifts off. Connect the launch controller to the rocket engine. Then step back and press the button on the controller to start the engine. Whoosh! The rocket flies up and away.
People who fly model rockets often join model rocket clubs. Schools or hobby groups can have information about model rocket clubs. A science center or museum might have a model rocket club, too.
Many people enter model rocket competitions. They set off rockets and see which one flies the highest and the fastest. Model rocket competitions are held all over the world.
In the United States, students between twelve and eighteen can enter the Team America Rocketry Challenge. Every spring, one hundred teams compete to become the best in the country. The winners go on to compete against other teams from around the world.

" It is very important to protect your brain. Wearing a helmet will protect your brain from getting hurt. When you fall, you put out your hands to catch yourself. You land on your wrists, knees, and elbows. Wrist, knee, and elbow pads can protect you from breaking your bones.
Riding near cars is very dangerous. Cars are big and fast, and the drivers cannot always see you. Ride your wheels on paths or the sidewalk. If you have to ride in the street, go with an adult.
Playgrounds are great for climbing, swinging, and spinning. But lots of kids get hurt on playgrounds. Most kids get hurt by falling. Soft ground, such as wood chips or rubber, can help you land safely. Some kids cut themselves on broken toys. Keep away from broken or rusty playground toys.
Lots of people love swimming, boating, and water sports. But every year, many people get hurt in the water. Always swim with a buddy and with an adult watching. There should be a lifeguard on duty at community swimming areas. If you swim alone, you could get hurt and someone might not see you in time.
Always follow signs and rules. Swimming in dirty water can make you sick. If you swim where there are strong waves and currents, you could be swept away. If you dive outside diving areas, you could hit your head and injure your brain. Boats, jet skis, and water skis usually go on lakes, rivers, and the ocean. This kind of water can have currents and waves. It might be very cold. A life jacket keeps your head above water so you do not drown.
Playing safely can keep you from getting hurt. It can even save your life. Make sure you and your friends always play safely.",580.0

The town was decorated with ribbons, streamers, and banners of red, white, and blue. The whole town came out to see Sam lead the big parade.
The school band followed behind Sam and played patriotic tunes. He wagged his tail and barked in time with the music.
After a while, he started to dance on his back legs. Everyone watched him hopping and spinning in circles. They clapped and cheered for their favorite patriotic pup.
A man offered Sam some tasty barbecue. He happily ate it, and he liked it so much that he begged for more. The man laughed and gave him a second piece.
Sam waved his paw to thank the people in the army. They waved back.
The mayor even walked up and shook Sam’s paw. “What day in July is the birthday of the United States?” the mayor asked. Sam barked four times for the Fourth of July!
“I don’t think anyone has been this excited for an Independence Day since 1776!” the mayor said. To show his excitement, Sam ran in circles around the mayor, and everyone laughed.
The parade made a lot of noise as it followed Sam through the town. Sam enjoyed hearing it all. They had almost walked to the park where the parade was to end.
Suddenly, some fireworks exploded with a very loud bang. The people cheered, but Sam didn’t like the fireworks. He ran home to get away from them.
The people wondered where the leader of the parade was going. The parade followed Sam all the way to his backyard. It had grown dark, and fireworks started to fill the night sky.

Do You Know? New skin is under the old skin. It is soft at first but soon hardens. The caterpillar sheds its skin four to six times and eats the old skin each time. The caterpillar grows for two to four weeks.
When the caterpillar is grown, it hangs from a branch to prepare for the next stage. It sheds its skin one last time. The new skin is bright green and looks like a leaf.
This green skin hardens around the caterpillar. It will protect it from other animals as it changes inside. The caterpillar becomes a pupa. It will stay inside its shell for one to two weeks. During this time, big changes happen to its body.
An adult butterfly comes out of the shell. Its wet wings are folded against its body.
The new butterfly rests. The butterfly must hang upside down, or it will not be able to fly. Blood pumping into the wings causes them to unfold and spread out.
The butterfly hangs for several hours. The sun and air dry its delicate wings. A butterfly has two pairs of wings. They are covered in scales. The wings in the front often have a different pattern from the pair in the back. The colors on the wings are usually similar to each other.
Once the butterfly is able to fly, it flies off to eat. Unlike a caterpillar, a butterfly does not eat leaves. Instead, it sips sweet liquid from flowers. It also searches for a mate.
Adult butterflies do not grow. They save their energy for flying and laying eggs. Females are bigger than males. A monarch butterfly may only live for two to six weeks. After she finds a mate, the female monarch lays her eggs. The butterfly life cycle starts all over again.",563.0
" The first word you speak will kill your brothers.”
The princess set out for the forest to begin her work. She gathered many nettles, which burned great blisters on her hands. With the nettles, she made yarn for the first shirt.
Her brothers returned at sunset, and when they saw her hands, the youngest brother wept. Where his tears fell, the pain stopped and the blisters vanished.
Each day, Eliza knit another shirt. When she needed more burning nettles, she gathered them and hurried back to the castle. Each day at dusk, the brothers returned to her. Each dawn, they again became wild swans and flew away. But one morning the queen saw them leaving Eliza’s open window and grew worried.
The next dawn, before they could fly away, the queen threw a giant net over the swans. She had men haul the swans to a dark cell deep in the castle’s dungeon. Eliza found them there and continued to knit through the dark nights outside their cell door.
Then the queen announced that there would be a grand feast: roast bird for everyone in the castle. Only Eliza knew the truth about the feast, and she could not speak it. She continued her task instead.
The morning of the feast, ten shirts lay beside her at her brothers’ cell. She was working hard on the last shirt when the men came to haul the swans away. As the queen unlocked the cell door, Eliza threw the eleven shirts over the swans.
They turned into eleven handsome princes, but the youngest brother’s shirt was not quite done. He was left with a swan’s wing instead of an arm.
When the king learned the truth about his new wife, he sent guards to arrest her. On her throne they found a vulture—the queen was never seen again.",634.0

She turned on a light and pointed it at Louie’s mouth. “It’s too bright!” Louie yelled. The dentist gave him a pair of dark, flip-up sunglasses and inspected his teeth.
“Hmmm,” she said, “there’s some trouble with your upper left cuspid.” “What’s an upper left cuspid?” Louie asked, trembling. “It’s the scientific name for one of your fangs. I’m going to give you a special new tooth.” Louie cried into his cape. “Not my fang!”
“It’s okay,” the dentist said. She gave him some medicine, which made him sleepy. “This chair is really great,” he said and then fell asleep.
“When are you going to take out my tooth?” Louie asked when he woke up. “It’s already done,” the dentist said.
Louie felt the tip of his new tooth with his tongue. The dentist held up a mirror so he could see his new gold fang. “I love it,” Louie said, shaking the dentist’s hand. She gave him a sticker and his own roll of dental floss.

Frank saw them and broke into a grin. “The early bird gets the worm!” he cried.Nola and Pablo looked at each other. Pablo had never been early for anything in his life, either.“Climb on up here, sonny, and give me a hand with this float !” shouted Frank. “You too, missy!”
Frank put them both to work for more than an hour. When they were done, his float looked fantastic.“So,” Pablo said at last, “I guess you’re all ready for next year’s parade.”
“Next year?” Frank cried. “Try this year!” Nola and Pablo blinked in confusion. “Wait a minute,” Nola said. “Wasn’t the parade at ten o’clock today?”“ Was at ten?” Frank cried. “ Will be at ten is more like it!”He thrust his wristwatch toward them. It said 9:30.Nola laughed for joy. “I fell forward ,” she said. “I needed to fall back.”
She had sprung forward an hour when everybody else had fallen back an hour. That meant she and Pablo were now two hours ahead of everybody else. For once in their lives, they were early!“The early bird gets the worm!” Nola cried.Frank nodded. “You got it now, missy,” he said.Pablo yawned.

On the truck is the equipment that firefighters need, including medical supplies and a snake box! In the desert, the fire station gets calls from people with snakes in their yards.
If the snakes are dangerous, firefighters capture them with a metal pole called a snake grabber. The snakes are locked safely in the box. They’re let go later, far from any houses or businesses. Uncle Jason shows me a rattlesnake. It gives me the creeps, but it’s cool, too.
The firefighters show me the gear they wear in a fire, and I get to put it on. There’s a special coat, pants, a helmet, and an air tank. It’s like wearing a winter coat in the summer—heavy and hot! If there’s ever a fire at home, Uncle Jason warns me never to hide under my bed or behind my curtains. That would make it hard for firefighters to find me.

The next day, the creatures representing each group met. Everyone listened to the issues. When the groups started to argue, Maddy reminded them to work together. Each group then shared the rules that they thought would let everyone sleep. In the end, they came up with rules that everyone could agree on.

The emperor walked slowly through the crowd of children and flowers, studying each child and pot as he went. Something was wrong. The emperor didn’t look pleased. In fact, it seemed as though the prettier the flower, the angrier he became. At last he came to Chen and his empty pot.

“Hello, Prince,” the queen called, reining in her horse. “I have been looking everywhere for someone like you. Since my husband died, this country has been in ruin. Will you marry me and be my king?” She was not coy at all. She expected him to say yes and be grateful for her offer. After all, she was the queen.
The shepherd was a practical man. It did not take him long to make up his mind. He decided that he would rather be king of his own country than live with the beautiful fairy a long way away. So he bowed very low. “Yes, ma’am. I would be honored to be your king.”
The moment he said the words, his fine clothes vanished and his carriage disappeared as well. He stood there in his old threadbare smock, surrounded by sheep. The assistants laughed at his clothes and his sheep.
The queen could hardly believe her eyes. “And who is this?” she asked scornfully. She was embarrassed to think that she had asked such a humble man to be her husband. She ordered her assistants to chase him and his sheep away. Then she rode off with her nose in the air.
The shepherd was ashamed. And he was out of breath. When he went to round up his sheep, he could not find them anywhere. They had all run away. He sat down on the ground and looked at his old clothes. “What have I done?” he asked himself. “I am such a fool.”

Sitting Bull pointed to a speck high in the sky. Annie took aim and shot. The speck flew on, and Buffalo Bill shook his head and started to walk away. Sitting Bull made him wait.

“Oh. Why?” Suddenly, the Namer got a strange look on her face. She herself did not really know why things were called what they were. It sounded right,” she finally replied. “That’s it? It sounded right?”
“Yes. You looked like a monkey to me. And you, Balam, looked like an iguana. My favorite name in this rainforest is sloth. I named him with a sneeze. I was allergic to him. The cuckoo named herself, because of a sound she made. And sometimes I just try to think of words that sound fun or make me laugh.”
“You see, when I was young, I began to name animals. I use names to separate one creature from another. But whatever name I chose, I was careful to stay true to each creature.” Finally it made sense. Names were meant to set apart each special creature. They were just like the names that Tari and Balam were given specially by their parents.
Tari and Balam had reached their goal. While their names did not turn out to be as mysterious as they had thought, they were happy to know the truth.

Will that be enough?” “Yes, it will!” Mom said. “Are you sad that the tax will make you wait another week to get your backpack? “A little bit,” Molly nodded. “But maybe my tax money will help build a park.”",561.0
" Sometimes people eat some kinds of tree sugars for food. You’ve probably had tree sugar for breakfast—pouring it over your pancakes or waffles. Have you guessed what tree sugar this is? It’s maple syrup, and it comes from the food, or sap, of a sugar maple tree.
Deciduous trees grow flowers, which make seeds that are inside fruit or nuts. Conifers make cones instead of flowers. The cones do the same job for conifers that flowers do on other trees. They make seeds to grow more trees. Each seed holds its own supply of food to keep it alive until it’s ready to sprout.
How does a tall tree grow from a small seed? The seed soaks up water until it can send out a root. With more water, leaves inside the seed case grow until they push up and out. Once this has happened, we say the seed has sprouted. Now the sprout can make its own food and no longer needs the seed’s store of energy. The seed leaves will make food for the new sprout.
While trees look like they aren’t doing much, they are working. They make their own food by changing sunlight and air into sugars. This helps keep the air clean, too. Trees are homes and food for birds and other animals. Look to see which animals make homes in trees near your home. Some animals, including humans, eat sap, fruit, and seeds from trees. Others eat bark and leaves.
Trees do many things. Tree leaves shade us on sunny days. They also shade new sprouts from the heat of the sun so they won’t burn. Tree roots hold the soil in place that trees and other plants need to grow. From saplings to mighty giants, trees stand tall.",592.0

Next to her, Raúl fussed with his hair. “You’re lucky your parents didn’t make you get a haircut,” he complained. “I hate this short hair!” “That’s nothing,” said Lei. “At least you can still smile for the camera. Look at this!” Lei flashed a jack-o’-lantern grin, showing several missing teeth.
Poppy looked around at her classmates. Rosa had a bandage taped across her nose. Gabe was pulling at his pants, trying to hide his mismatched socks. Evan’s broken arm was still in a cast. “I guess we all have something we don’t like about our looks. None of us is perfect,” Poppy said.
“All right, second graders,” the photographer called. “You’re up!” The class marched onstage. “What a great- looking bunch!” she shouted cheerfully. The photographer arranged the class, moving Poppy front and center. She felt noticeable, like a big goofy target. Maybe it would be okay if I took the glasses off for just a minute, she thought. She was starting to remove them when the photographer leaned close and whispered, “Nice glasses.” She winked from behind her own funky red frames.
Poppy smiled and glanced at her classmates. She thought about how each one of them had been nervous for picture day. They couldn’t take off a bad haircut or hide a broken arm. We’re all different, she thought. Maybe that’s what makes us special. She decided to wear her glasses for the picture. “Cheese!” the class called out. Poppy smiled her brightest.

“Hurry up!” Shorty screamed. “I’m getting tired.” Shorty was sweating on the pogo stick. Still jumping, he started to move through the human maze. People cheered him on as he blew his biggest bubble, bouncing all the while.
Shorty turned a corner in the maze. The pogo stick wobbled, but Shorty did not fall off. At the end of the maze, he leapt off the pogo stick and collapsed on the ground. “A new world record!” Ruby yelled.
Everyone cheered and rushed to give Shorty high fives. “Not bad, Shorty,” Ben said. Shorty lay on the ground. He reached up his hand to give high fives to everybody who had come to watch him. Ruby wanted to write that up as a new record, too.
“Hold on,” said Ben. He did some quick research on his phone. “There are a lot of high-five records out there. Most high fives in a minute wearing a banana costume. Loudest high five. Most in a rainy parking lot. But I don’t see any with one person on his back.” “You’ve got potential,” Ruby said. “I could use someone like you to help me invent new records. Want to be my assistant?” “First, though,” Shorty said to Ben, “it’s your turn.” Ben high-fived him.
“No,” Shorty said. “Your turn to get into ‘The Other Book of World Records.’” Ben looked shocked. “Me?” he gasped. “No! I don’t—“Ruby winked at Shorty. “Step right up!” she yelled. “We’ve got a new world record in the making!”",545.0

Suddenly there was a banging on the door. “Let me in! Let me in!” It was Benjamin.
Angie opened the door, and Benjamin tumbled in, clutching something under his shirt. They could hear Sara running down the hallway outside. “Come back here!” she yelled. “Give me my fin!” “Benjamin,” Angie said sternly, “are you stealing Sara’s swim fins again?” Jared closed the door. “Angie—that’s it!” “What?” “Sara’s fin made our footprint! Give it to me, Ben!”
“Oh, no—of course!” Angie said, slapping her forehead, while Benjamin pulled the fin out from under his shirt. “Ben, were you down by the creek awhile ago?” Jared asked. “Nooooo.” Ben said innocently. “Well, a long time ago.” Meanwhile Angie measured the fin and compared it to their drawing and notes. “You’re right, Jared—it’s an almost perfect fit.” Then she noticed the blanket tucked into Benjamin’s shorts. “The tail marks must have been his blanket!”
Benjamin grinned up at them. “You mean you found my monster print?” Angie and Jared looked at each other and laughed. “First we thought it was a dinosaur,” said “Then we thought it was a bird,” said Angie. “But now we know it was the scariest monster in the whole world!” And she gave Benjamin a hug.",562.0

“This is mostly for family, though I suppose Ratona was part of ours,” Mamá said. “We can celebrate her the day before,” I suggested. What Is Day of the Dead?
Later, Mamá and I went to the market in Puebla. We got paper banners, sugar skulls, and marigolds.
On October 31, my friends came over. Adriana brought her dog, Sal, or Salt. She had a photo of Sal’s sister, Pimienta, or Pepper, who died last summer.Gloria had a picture of Raúl the rooster, a pet she had lost. We set up the banners, marigolds, and photos where Ratona used to sit.
“Once, Pimienta stole a pound of cheese from our cooler. She got into the trash and ate it later! I have cheese for Pimienta,” Adriana said.
“My mother makes pumpkin seeds for my great-grandfather’s ofrenda. Raúl jumped up and ate them! My mother was so mad. I brought some for Raúl,” Gloria said.
“If someone had ice cream, Ratona went Squeak! Squeak! until you let her lick the bowl. I have ice cream for Ratona,” I said.

" Even after it can walk, the joey may still ride in mom’s pouch.
There are over three hundred types of marsupials. Most of them live in Australia (aw-STRAYL-yuh) and eat plants. Let’s look at a few kinds of marsupials and their joeys.
This joey stays in its mother’s pouch for eight months while it grows very tall. Its feet and tail grow very long, too. Can you guess what it is?
It’s a red kangaroo! A red kangaroo is the largest marsupial. It can stand over six feet tall and weigh 200 lbs (91 kg). It can jump 30 feet (9 m) with each leap!
When grown, this little joey will look like a furry teddy bear with big ears. It will live most of its life sitting in trees and eating leaves. Can you guess what it is?
It’s a koala! A koala lives, eats, and sleeps in eucalyptus (yoo-kuh-LIP-tus) trees. It is happy just to sit and eat lots of leaves every day. A koala usually only walks around at night.
This marsupial mom might carry three or four noisy joeys in her pouch at one time. Her little joeys can scream very loudly. What are they?
They are Tasmanian devils! The Tasmanian devil gets its name from its loud screams, sharp teeth, bad smell, and wild look. It is a meat-eater, and lives only on the island of Tasmania (taz-MAY-nee-uh).
Most marsupials eat plants, and many, like the koala, live quietly in forests. When those forests are cut down, their homes, food, and safety are lost. Other marsupials have lost their sources of food to herds of grazing cows or growing cities.
Most marsupials and their joeys live in only one place on Earth. We need to protect their special habitats and food sources—so we will always know where the joeys are.",683.0
" The pyramid was shaped to look like the Sun’s rays shining on Earth. People believed that the king would go to heaven on the rays of the Sun.
Pyramids took many years to build. When a king was still alive, people began building his pyramid. The stones used to make the pyramid were huge. It took hard work to get the stones out of the ground. It took harder work to move the stones to where the pyramid would be built. Some stones were moved on boats. Other stones were moved over land using big sleds.
Inside the pyramid was a tomb. This was a special room where the king’s body was placed. Many objects were put in the tomb. There were statues, paintings, and many gold things.
Many hidden tunnels and rooms were built inside a pyramid. They were built to trick anyone who tried to steal things from the tomb. Giant stones were put in front of the doorway of the real tomb. They were used to keep out thieves. Still, almost every king’s tomb has been robbed over the years. But the pyramids still stand.
The Great Pyramid at Giza is a famous pyramid. It was built for King Khufu. It has more than two million blocks of stone. Other pyramids near it were built for the king’s relatives. A statue called the Sphinx guards all of the pyramids. The Sphinx has the face of a king and the body of a lion.

There are many resources we need that are buried deep inside the Earth. We need big machines to get resources out. Oil drilling rigs are set up to remove oil.
Large drills are used to get coal out of mines. Very large excavators dig up the earth in search of resources. Huge dump trucks then carry the resources to where they can be used to make products.
There are big machines that move things on the water. Tugboats are machines that move other things over water by pulling and pushing. They pull barges. They push and pull large ships.
Ocean liners are large ships that move people. Oil tankers are huge ships that carry massive amounts of oil. And container ships are stacked high with containers that carry things from place to place.
Large airplanes carry people and cargo. A 747 is a giant passenger jet that can carry 400 to 450 people. The C-5 is a huge cargo plane. It is almost as long as a football field. Helicopters are flying machines too. The skycrane is a helicopter that is used to lift heavy objects. It can lift 15,000 pounds. It is used to carry things like bulldozers and power line towers into hard-to-reach places.

" While they are swimming, their eyes and nostrils stick out of the water. They can still see and breathe when they are mostly underwater.
Crocodilians use large, powerful tails and webbed feet to move through water. When underwater, they close their ears and nostrils so that water stays out. They can also shut off their windpipe. This allows them to open their mouth without breathing in water.
Crocodilians are fierce hunters. They use strong jaws to capture their prey. They eat animals as big as deer and cattle, and as small as fish and birds. They also will attack people. They cannot chew their food. They either swallow it whole or tear it apart. Sometimes they drag an animal underwater to drown it.
Crocodilians are very fierce fighters. When a crocodilian attacks, it is almost impossible to escape. But they have their enemies, too. They may be killed in a fight with a leopard or lion.
Some crocodilians lay their eggs in sand. Others make a nest with soil and plants. Newly hatched babies are mostly helpless. Many get eaten by other animals. The lucky ones have Mom to protect them after they hatch. Babies grow quickly. They are adults by the time they are 5 to 8 years old.
Most crocodilians are endangered. In many parts of the world, people kill crocodilians for food and for their skins. Farmers destroy their homes to create land for growing crops and grazing animals. Crocodilians are also captured for use in wildlife parks. They are often killed when they grow too big.

Smoke masks and air tanks protect firefighters from smoke. Firefighters use large fans to remove smoke from rooms. They also use fire extinguishers to put out small fires.
The fire truck is an important firefighting machine. There are four major kinds of fire trucks. The most common is the pumper truck. It carries long hoses and a pump to spray water over long distances.
Other kinds of fire trucks include ladder trucks, tanker trucks, and rescue trucks. Ladder trucks carry ladders of many different sizes. Big ladder trucks have a ladder that can reach up to eight stories high. Tanker trucks carry water to fight fires in places without water. Rescue trucks carry equipment to help rescue people who are trapped.
There are other kinds of firefighting machines, too. Fireboats fight fires on other boats that are in the water. They pump water from under the boat and spray it on the fire.
Helicopters dump water on fires in places that trucks cannot reach. Large planes help fight forest fires. Sometimes planes dump fire-retardant chemicals instead of water to slow the spread of a forest fire.
You must be at least 18 years old to be a firefighter. Before you can become a firefighter, you must pass a fitness test. You must be in very good shape to fight fires. You also must pass a written test.
Firefighters go to firefighting school for training. They learn how to fight different kinds of fires. They also learn how to rescue people and how to treat injuries.
Every year, fires destroy thousands of buildings. Fires also take many lives and destroy large areas of forest. Long ago, fires burned down entire cities because there was no way to stop fires from spreading. But today, we have brave firefighters to put out fires and help to keep us safe.",661.0

The project began in 1931. Workers had to make the river go around where Hoover Dam would be built. They dug four tunnels, and they also built huge walls above and below where the dam would be. After they finished, the water flowed into the tunnels and out lower down. Then workers moved rocks and mud away to make room for the dam.
Workers used giant molds to build the dam. They dumped huge buckets of concrete into each mold. Cold water ran through small pipes so each block of concrete would cool quickly. After each block was cool, workers built another block on top of it. Later, they sealed the stacks of blocks with grout.
If the river ever flooded, the water would ruin the power plant. Workers built two places for the water to go if it got very high. Those places are called spillways. Finally, workers built the power plant and four towers. The towers control how much water goes to the power plant at a time.
All the work was finished in 1936. The project took about five years. Building Hoover Dam was hard, unsafe work. Many workers lost their lives during the project.
Millions of people see Hoover Dam every year. The visitor center has displays about the area and how the dam was built. People can go inside the dam and power plant. At Lake Mead, they can go fishing and boating. Take a camera if you go. There’s a lot to see!
Hoover Dam changed many people’s lives. The river’s water helps crops grow in dry areas of the United States. The power plant makes electricity for over a million people.

Ichiro loved playing in Japan. Yet he wanted to show that he could play in the United States. He was thinner and smaller than most American players. He also didn’t hit the ball hard. Instead, he slapped at it with his bat.
Ichiro joined the Seattle Mariners in 2001. He played very well as a rookie. Ichiro had a.350 batting average. He led the American League in hits with 242. He stole 56 bases and scored 127 runs.
Ichiro won the American League Rookie of the Year Award. He also won the Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award. It is not often that a player wins both. Ichiro was one of the top players in the game. He played with the Mariners until 2012. That year, he was traded to the New York Yankees.
Ichiro has won two Most Valuable Player Awards while playing in the United States. He also won two awards for batting and ten Gold Gloves. Ichiro doesn’t hit many home runs. Still, he led the league in singles ten years in a row.

" You will move more slowly through water because it is denser, or thicker, than air. In the same way, light moves faster through air than through water. Light bends when it moves between water and air. That’s why a pencil sitting in a clear glass of water looks bent.
Outdoor rainbows form when water drops meet sunlight. The light bends as it enters each drop. The light then reflects, or bounces, off the back of each drop, like light off a mirror. The light bends again as it leaves the drop. Light bends and bounces in millions of water drops at once. This process makes all the colors of a rainbow.
Sunlight is made up of many colors. We can see them when water drops split the light into different colors. To see a rainbow, you have to be in the right place. Each water drop reflects colored light at a slightly different angle. We can only see red light shining from the drops at the rainbow’s top. Those drops are in the right place to shine the color red back at us. In the same way, we can only see violet shining from drops at the rainbow’s bottom.
The colors of a rainbow always appear in the same order. The name ROY G. BIV can help you remember the seven main colors: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet.
For a long time, rainbows have been featured in art and stories from all over the world. Most people find it hard not to stop and stare when a rainbow appears. Science explains how these colorful displays happen. Water drops bend, split, and reflect light. Then we are able to see the many colors of a rainbow.

" Different vibrations in the vocal cords make different sounds.
A vibrating object makes the air around it move. This is how sound travels. It moves outward in all directions. For example, when a tree crashes to the ground, the air around it vibrates. When the vibrating air reaches your ear, you hear the sound of a crashing tree. The vibrating air is called sound waves. Sound waves also travel through solids and liquids.
Not all sound is alike. Some sounds are loud. Others are quiet. The loudness of sound is called volume. The more air that vibrates, the louder the volume. For example, a lion’s roar vibrates more air than a buzzing bee’s wings. Sound also can be high or low. This is called pitch. Pitch depends on how fast something vibrates. Sirens vibrate quickly and have a high pitch. Bass drums vibrate slowly and have a low pitch.
The outside of your ear is shaped to collect sound waves. The sound waves move from outside the ear to inside the ear. Tiny bones inside vibrate when they are struck by sound waves. The vibrating bones send messages through nerves to your brain. Your brain then interprets the messages as noise, music, talking, or other sounds.
The inner parts of the ear are very sensitive. Very loud sounds can hurt your ears. Be careful around loud noises. Cover your ears with your hands, or wear coverings on your ears such as earphones or earplugs. Or simply move away from the loud sounds.
We are surrounded by sounds. Vibrations make loud, quiet, high, and low sounds. Our ears pick up these sounds, and our brain tells us what they are. Enjoy the many sounds of the world and be careful with your ears!",598.0

Finally, they heard a clink as they hit something solid. They helped Pirate Chalk Beard lug out an enormous wooden chest. He creaked open the lid—inside were pirate costumes. The class pulled them out in a rush. By the time Jack reached inside the treasure chest, there was nothing left.
Pirate Chalk Beard winked, took off his hat, and set it on Jack’s head. “I was once a shy pirate myself, you know,” he said.“You were?” Jack asked.“Aye,” the pirate said.
Jack felt the brim of the large hat and smiled. “Thank you, Captain,” he said. “Arrr! You wear it well,” Chalk Beard said. “Remember, matey, it isn’t the size of your voice that matters. It’s the size of your heart.” “I’ll remember,” Jack said.
Jack grinned. “I know why it takes pirates so long to learn the alphabet,” he said. “Oh?” said Chalk Beard. “And why might that be?”“Because they spend years at C,” Jack said.Chalk Beard laughed. “So we do,” he said, then stroked his beard. “We also get stuck on ‘Arrr.’”",552.0
" He peeked over the hedge and saw that his suspicion was true! There was a little man wearing a leather apron and a pointed hat. He was using a tiny hammer the size of a pin to shape a tiny golden shoe. Jack knew at once that he had found a leprechaun.
Jack crept close to the leprechaun and said good morning to him. The leprechaun smiled, said hello, and offered Jack a drink of water. “Just hand me that bottle,” the leprechaun said, hoping Jack would look away. But Jack just stared straight at the leprechaun and said, “No, thank you.” They talked for a while. The leprechaun tried many ways to trick Jack into looking away, but Jack wasn’t fooled.
Jack demanded that the leprechaun take him to a pot of gold. Finally, the leprechaun gave up trying to trick Jack and took him to a field of dandelions. He showed Jack the flower that the treasure was buried under, but Jack did not have a shovel. Jack used one of his socks to cover the dandelion and mark the spot. Then, Jack went home to get a shovel.
When Jack came back, every dandelion in the field had a sock on it. He never did find the sock that marked the buried pot of gold. Jack carried the socks home and told his wife what happened. She said that at least he would not need new socks for a while. Then they both started laughing.
Colleen and her parents started laughing, too. “Imagine a field full of socks!” exclaimed Colleen. “What a funny story.” Colleen could see that she was going to like learning about Ireland from her grandparents. This would be a great visit!",716.0
"“Not really,” she said. “Let’s try something.”She asked Leroy’s mother to pretend she was the Sun, and Leroy to pretend he was planet Earth.
Next, she told him to spin like a top while also circling his mom. “Every time you complete a spin, one day passes,” she told Leroy. “You also move a little bit in a big loop around the Sun. One full loop, getting back to where you started, is one year. That’s 365 spins—or days—on your journey.”
“Over time, people figured out a year was not exactly 365 days,” Mrs. Willowbark explained. “To complete a full year, you have to spin a little bit more. You need an extra quarter of a turn, or six hours, every year. In four years, that adds up to one full extra day, a special year with 366 days.”“Calendars would not work without leap years,” she added. “In a hundred years, summer would start almost a month later.”
“Why are they called leap years? ” Leroy asked.Mrs. Willowbark smiled. “Say New Year’s Eve was Sunday last year. Usually that means it would be Monday this year, but in a leap year, it would be Tuesday. It would ‘skip’ or ‘leap’ ahead a full day.”Leroy laughed for joy. He finally understood!
When he returned home, Leroy’s friends were waiting for him, with streamers and party hats. “Happy birthday!” they shouted.“We didn’t forget—we just wanted to surprise you,” Alan said. “Your mom got you out of the house while we decorated.”
Leroy spun around and stared at his mom in amazement. “When you were born, my heart leaped for joy,” Mom said. She brought out a cake with eight candles. Six were blue and two red—Leroy’s favorite color—for his special leap year birthdays.

" The load of spice had to cross the sea between Africa and Europe. So it was put onto one last boat. It could be sent to Greece, France, or many other countries. All the boat workers had to be paid.
When the boat reached Europe, the journey was almost complete. The pepper was carried over land by carts. All the drivers had to be paid. At last, it was sold at a high price. This helped pay everyone who worked to get it to Europe. Kings and queens in Europe paid their own explorers to find new ways to bring back spices and other riches. Explorers were able to sail from Europe all the way to India and back. This was cheaper than bringing it over land.
Pepper is used around the world today. But it is much, much cheaper now. You can buy it in a store with just a few coins. Many places even give it away for free. Imagine how a king from 600 years ago would feel if he saw free pepper! Why is pepper cheaper today? Now there is enough supply to meet the demand. Also, people can ship peppercorns around the world in just a few hours. People use fast ships, trains, trucks, and even airplanes to quickly get pepper to those who want it.
The pepper that comes out of your shaker is just like the pepper from 2000 years ago. It tastes the same. It still grows in India and in rainy parts of the world. So the next time you grind pepper on your food, imagine you are a king or queen. Think of what you could have bought in the 1400s with a whole shaker full of the King of Spices. It was like sprinkling your food with little bits of gold!",718.0

" He kept me warm all night. By the next morning, we were ready to go again.
I thought that was the last of our troubles. The next morning dawned bright and cold, and we were running hard. It wasn’t long before we were at the head of the pack again. And Dog, as always, was right up front.
During a short rest, Dog’s ears suddenly pricked up. There was a crashing sound coming from the trees. A huge bull moose stumbled into the clearing where we were. Nothing scares me more than moose. Unlike bears, they’re unpredictable. They seem to get mad and charge for no reason.
The moose sent a puff of steam out of its nostrils. Then, with a grunt, it started to gallop toward us. This was a disaster. The moose was about to trample me and my entire sled-dog team. But like a shot, Dog leapt at the moose and seized its leg.
The moose gave a mighty kick. It was too much even for Dog, who went sailing through the air. He hit a tree, hard, and I was sure he was dead. The moose lowered its head and seemed to eye the rest of the dogs. But Dog got up. He stood swaying on his three legs. And he stared that moose in the eyes until the moose realized that Dog would never, ever give up. Looking a little frightened, the moose retreated into the woods.
That was the third time my three-legged dog had saved my life. After that, I knew what I would name him. I chose the word Troika. It’s a Russian word that refers to things that come in threes. And even though he only has three legs, he has proven three times that he is a true superhero.",579.0

The bird grabbed the key with his beak and dropped it. “You’re the best,” Alia called as she unlocked the door and raced to the freezer. She tossed frozen leftovers onto the floor.

Ben watched as it sank in that Dave’s brother had played a prank on him. “Don’t worry. You’re going to get a good grade on this, and I’m going to help,” Ben said.
“See, fiendish means evil or cruel—like that prank your brother played on you. You had a great summer, right?” Ben asked. Dave nodded. Ben flipped to another page and said, “I marked terrific as a replacement. What do you think?” Dave looked at the dictionary entry. At the end was a list of synonyms. “How about outstanding? ” he asked. “That’ll work. Now, abolish means to get rid of something,” Ben said, but Dave was ahead of him.

Ichiro joined the Seattle Mariners in 2001, becoming the first non-pitcher from Japan to play in the United States. He didn’t play that well in spring training. Things changed when the season began. As a rookie, Ichiro had an amazing .350 batting average. He led the American League in hits with 242. He stole 56 bases and scored 127 runs.
Ichiro was so good that he won the American League Rookie of the Year Award. He also won the Most Valuable Player Award (MVP). A rookie player rarely wins both. Ichiro was one of the top players in the game. He played with the Mariners until 2012, when he was traded to the New York Yankees.
Ichiro won two MVP awards and two batting titles while playing in the United States. He also won ten Gold Gloves for great defensive play. Ichiro doesn’t hit many home runs. Still, he led the league in singles ten years in a row.
Yet it’s one hit in 2004 that Ichiro remembers most. On October 1, he made hit number 258. Ichiro finally broke the record for single hits in a season that had been set by George Sisler in 1920. Afterward, Ichiro ran to the seats near first base. There sat Sisler’s 81-year-old daughter. Ichiro bowed to her, a sign of respect in Japan. “My father would have been delighted,” she said. “He would be so happy to know such a fine young man was doing so well.”
Ichiro has become one of the most feared hitters in baseball. Not too bad for a skinny guy who is smaller than most of the other players. “Through my career, I think this is the best moment,” Suzuki said at the time. “I can’t really put it into words.”",809.0

Then I just wanted to fix everything before you found out.”
Mom lowered her voice. “Zarela, you can always talk to me. I’m your mother—I want to help you.” I wiped my eyes with my shirtsleeve. “I really am sorry,” I said. “I should have told you as soon as the machine turned on.” “It’s all right,” Mom said. “I’m sorry, too. I should have gotten rid of this machine a long time ago. I was too proud of my greatest invention to let it go.”
I looked out the window. The football game was interrupted, and everyone was staring up at the snow. “Mom, I think we’d better do something before Vetero turns into the North Pole,” I said. “We have to destroy the machine,” Mom said. “It’s the only way.” Together we took off the front panel. Mom cut the wires leading to the buttons, and I removed the circuit board. The WeatherBot made a high-pitched whine, and the lights flickered off for the last time.

Mike had a sinking feeling in his stomach. For the first time, he studied the grocery receipt his mom had handed him the day before. “These lemons are sixty-nine cents each,” Mike said, stunned. He knew money didn’t grow on trees, but lemons did! How could anything from nature cost so much? Now Mike understood: out of season = expensive. Then Mike did some more math: 30 lemons at $0.69 each equaled $20.70. The organic sugar was $6.80. The total cost was $27.50.
Mike slid the box and its twenty-six-dollar contents across to his mom. When he spoke, his voice was scratchy and hard to hear. “I owe you a buck fifty,” he said.

" Kites were also used as flying targets. The kites trained soldiers to aim better. Soldiers shot at the kites. The moving kites were hard to hit with bullets.
Different shapes of kites fly in different ways. Flat, diamond-shaped kites fly easily. Box-shaped kites can hang still in the air for a long time. Stunt kites twist and twirl on many strings. Large parafoil kites act almost like parachutes. Giant dragon kites flutter. Fighting kites can be used to cut other kites’ strings.
You’ll need:
• two lightweight, smooth sticks, one 3 feet (90 cm) long, the other 2 feet (60 cm)
Step 1: Form a cross shape with the sticks. Wrap tape around the sticks where they meet.
Step 2: Cut off a 4-foot (120 cm) piece of string. Tape each end of the string to each end of the long stick. This string is called the bridle. Tie one end of the rest of the string to the middle of the bridle.
Step 3: Lay the cross on the open plastic bag. Cut a diamond shape around it. Make sure to cut the diamond shape wider than the ends of the sticks.
Step 4: Fold the corners of the diamond over the ends of the sticks. Tape the corners tightly to the sticks.
Step 5: For a tail, tape the strip of cloth or plastic to the bottom of the kite.
On a breezy day, take your kite to a flat, open area. Be sure that there are no power lines or big trees. Look at the ground around you. Is there anything you could trip over? Hold your kite up by the bridle and run into the wind. Let go of the kite and slowly let out some string. Then let out a little more until your kite is high in the sky. Happy flying!",553.0

A player called a goalkeeper, or goalie, guards each team’s goal. Goalies are the only players who can touch the ball with their arms and hands on the field.
The other players move the ball around the field by kicking it. They can also “trap” the ball by stopping it with their feet, knees, or chests. They can even “head” a ball in the air using their heads!
Players run with the ball by dribbling it. They kick the ball to themselves with short, quick taps.
Whenever a team has the ball and is trying to score, they are on offense. The team playing defense tries to keep the offense from scoring. They also try to take the ball away from the other team. Each team plays offense and defense many times during a match.
The referees make sure the players follow the rules. Players are not allowed to push, hold, or trip members of the other team. A referee can call a foul if a player breaks a rule. The referee can give the other team a free kick or a penalty kick.
Players often wear cleats on their feet so they can run on the grass without slipping. Players also wear shin guards to protect their legs.
If a ball goes out-of-bounds, a player throws it back into play. The player uses a special throw that starts with both hands behind the head.
A team gets one point for each goal it scores. At the end of the game, the team with the most goals wins. If the game ends in a tie, the teams may keep playing until someone scores. They may also take turns doing penalty kicks to decide the winner.
Soccer is great exercise and lots of fun to play! Players learn how to work together and be good sports.",562.0

Family is important to Korean people. South Koreans keep careful family records. School is important as well. Korean parents work hard to help their children learn.
Most of South Korea has hills and mountains. The highest peak is Mount Halla, an old volcano, at 1,950 meters (6,398 ft.).
Much of the coast of South Korea is broken up by rivers and streams. The land along the coast is very low. Most people in South Korea’s countryside live on the plains. Farmers there grow rice, fruits, and vegetables.
For hundreds of years, Korea was a hard place to get to. Its people were mostly left alone. Different kingdoms took control of the land. Japan took control of Korea in 1905. It remained under Japan’s control until the end of World War II.
When the war ended, most world leaders wanted Korea to have its own government. The United States and a country called the Soviet Union were supposed to help. They did not agree. In the end, South Korea freely chose its leaders. North Korea set up a government that was less free.
New Year’s Day may be the most important celebration in South Korea. On this holiday, people celebrate everyone becoming one year older. Korean Thanksgiving is another important holiday. Families gather and visit family graves. They remember their family members.

Cranes lift and move heavy things. Some cranes help workers build tall buildings. Others are used to move goods from ships to land.
The world’s biggest dump trucks are used at mines. Miners use these trucks to carry rocks and dirt. The trucks use some of the biggest tires in the world. Their tires are twice as tall as a person.
These trains are used to move heavy things to places without roads. The trains move on big wheels instead of on train tracks. Each wheel is taller than a person.
Some of the world’s biggest vehicles were made to move things that go into space. They carry space vehicles on a high platform. These vehicles are so wide that they need their own road.
Miners use giant power shovels to dig rocks and dirt out of a mine. Giant power shovels have a big bucket that can break into the earth and scoop it up.
These vehicles dig under the surface of the earth. They can even move through solid rock.
Bagger 288
The largest vehicle in the world is the Bagger 288. This huge vehicle digs mines. The Bagger 288 is almost as long as two football fields.
It digs with a huge wheel. The wheel has buckets along its edge that scoop up dirt as the wheel turns. The Bagger 288 is big enough to move mountains.
Big vehicles are used in many ways. These vehicles move heavy loads. They travel both above and below the ground. Gigantic vehicles have gotten much bigger over the years. Some of these vehicles keep getting bigger and bigger. How big are they going to get?",556.0

Most owls rely on their hearing to hunt. Most owls have huge ears, with one higher than the other. The higher ear hears sounds from above. The lower ear hears sounds from below. Owls can move the feathers around their faces to send more sound to one ear or the other. This helps them find prey.
Great gray owls can hear a mouse hidden under the snow. Barn owls can hear a mouse moving far away and catch one in complete darkness. These owls have the best hearing of any animal ever tested.
Many animals that owls hunt also have very good hearing. So if an owl wants to eat, it must attack by surprise. The soft feathers that cover owls’ bodies help them fly without a sound.
The main food for most owls is small animals—lots of them. A hungry great gray owl may eat 1,400 mice in a year. In its lifetime, a barn owl may eat 11,000 mice!
Some owls can live in many different habitats. Other owls need a special habitat, though. Burrowing owls live mostly on the prairie, making their nests underground. They use old burrows dug by other animals. Sometimes they move into fields and golf courses, and even near airport runways.
Spotted owls can only survive in old forests with huge trees. By 1994, most of their habitat had been destroyed by logging. Today, few spotted owls are left.
People don’t often see owls, but they’re out there. If you’re in the country and want to find one, try going out at sunset. Listen for their calls.
If you stay out late enough, people might think you’re an owl—a night owl, that is.",724.0

Frogs are famous for their ability to leap with their long, strong back legs. They leap to catch insects and other prey. A frog can catch an insect in an instant with its long, sticky tongue.
The eyes and nostrils of a frog are on the top of its head. Frogs can see, smell, and breathe while they’re mostly under water. In fact, they breathe through their skin while they’re under water! Frogs can make an amazing amount of noise. Male frogs sing loudly to attract a mate.
Do you know the differences between frogs and toads? Here’s what I learned from a book at the library.
I was sad to learn that frogs and toads are food for many other animals. Bats, snakes, birds, and rodents all hunt them. But frogs and toads have clever ways to stay safe from animals that might try to eat them.
Some frogs and toads, like the wood frog I saw, are the same color as their habitat. This is called blending in. It allows them to hide better from predators. Some kinds of frogs are so poisonous that just touching their skin is deadly. These frogs are brightly colored to warn predators to stay away.
Some frogs try to trick predators that might want to eat them. The tomato frog puffs up like a balloon when a snake gets near. The snake thinks the frog is too big to eat. If the snake tries to eat it anyway, the frog leaks a liquid like glue from its skin.
Frogs Are Cool!
Frogs and toads come in many shapes, sizes, and colors. You can find them in trees, in or near water, and on the ground. One thing is true about all of them—they’re amazing animals. What kinds of frogs have you seen?",584.0
" So he threw away his seaweed suit and returned to his hole in the rock.
Peering out of his hole one morning, Keb noticed something strange had washed ashore. He crawled out of the hole to take a closer look. As he got closer he could see it was a boot. And a very fine boot it was.
The boot was bright blue, which was Keb’s favorite color in the world. He had always admired the blue starfish in the tide pools and he thought that blue crabs were the most handsome of all crabs. He had looked for a blue snail shell for a home when he was a smaller crab, but he had never found one.
Keb examined the boot more closely. It was made of rubber and would be perfect for stormy days when the cold wind and rain blew off the sea. And on the toe of the boot were two large eyes. Ah-ha, thought Keb. These eyes will surely scare off the swooping gulls.
And best of all, the boot was large. Keb looked inside and sized it up. The boot was most definitely big enough for Keb’s enormous body. He crawled into the boot. It was a perfect fit.
Keb strutted down the shore wearing his new home. The gulls were frightened by the two large eyes looking up at them.
All the other crabs ooooed and aaaahed as Keb walked by. They were envious of Keb’s beautiful new home. Keb was not only the biggest crab on the shore, he was also the most handsome.
The next week, Keb had an open house. All the other crabs came to see Keb’s home, and they all brought him gifts. Keb was no longer the laughingstock of all the crabs. He was the envy of the seashore.",636.0

A suitcase or moving box makes a good hiding spot for a bedbug. If a family brings that suitcase to a hotel, the bugs may crawl out. Some of the bedbugs might find hiding spots in the hotel. Some might hide in another person’s suitcase and go home with them. Once they get to a new home, bedbugs travel from room to room by squeezing through tiny cracks in the walls or floors.
It’s easy to spot bedbug bites. Many people get red, itchy bumps on their skin when they are bitten. But it’s not as easy to spot the bedbugs. They can hide in tiny places and only come out when it’s dark. But there are ways to find them.
Bedbugs often leave clues that they are around. If you look closely, you may find shed skin and dark spots of dried excrement, or poop, near their hiding areas. But the best way to find them is to hire a special dog. Some dogs are trained to smell bedbugs. They sniff all over homes or hotel rooms. When they smell bedbugs, they place a paw on the spot. Once the bugs are discovered, people can get rid of them with steam or chemicals.
Bedbugs are becoming common again in cities around the world. They are biting more people. Their bites don’t hurt, and they usually don’t spread germs or disease. But it’s still not nice to get them; they can itch—a lot.
If you do get bedbug bites, try to not scratch them. They can get infected if they are scratched open. And remember, you are not alone. People all over the world get bedbug bites. That’s why for years people have said, “Good night. Sleep tight. Don’t let the bedbugs bite!”",577.0
" When it is hot outside, more water vapor fills the air than when it is cold outside. Humidity is the amount of water vapor in the air. On hot and humid days, the air feels thick with lots of water vapor concentrated in the air.
Earth’s water is always changing from one state to another. When frozen water is heated, it melts and becomes liquid water. When liquid water is cooled, it freezes and becomes ice.
Liquid water can become a gas, too. Have you ever seen a puddle of water dry up on a hot day? Energy from the Sun changed the liquid to a gas in a process called evaporation. Evaporation happens every day as the Sun beats down on Earth’s bodies of water. When water vapor in the air cools down, it changes from a gas to a liquid. This process is called condensation.
Clouds are made up of tiny drops of water formed by condensation. The tiny drops stick together, creating larger, heavier drops. If the drops become large enough, they fall as rain, snow, or another type of precipitation. Some rain and melted snow soak into the ground, becoming groundwater. Precipitation and groundwater fill rivers, lakes, streams, and ponds. Water evaporates from bodies of water around the world. Later, it condenses and falls in other places on Earth.
Rain keeps plants alive and allows them to grow. People and other animals need water to survive. We also use it for other purposes, such as fighting fires.
It is important to take care of Earth’s water. People are the main cause of water pollution, although sometimes it occurs naturally. Littering and dumping trash lead to dirty and unusable water. Polluted water makes people, plants, and animals sick. Would you want to drink and play in polluted water?",717.0
" It molts one last time. The new skin is bright green and resembles a leaf.
This green skin hardens around the caterpillar to protect it from predators as it changes inside. The caterpillar becomes a pupa, or chrysalis (KRI-suh-lus). It will stay inside its shell for one to two weeks. During this time, its body is completely transformed.
An adult butterfly emerges from the shell. Its wet wings are folded against its body.
The butterfly must hang upside down to rest and gain strength, or it will not be able to fly. Blood pumping into the wings causes them to unfold and spread out.
The butterfly hangs for several hours. The sun and air dry its delicate wings. A butterfly has two pairs of wings that are covered in scales. The wings in the front often have a slightly different pattern from the pair in the back. When a butterfly rests, it holds its wings up. The colors on the wings are usually similar to each other.
Once the butterfly is able to fly, it flies off to eat. Unlike a caterpillar, a butterfly does not eat leaves. Instead it sips nectar from flowers. It also searches for a mate.
Adult butterflies do not grow. They conserve their energy for flying and laying eggs. Females are usually bigger than males and have wider stripes on their wings. The last monarchs of the season will migrate, or move, to a warmer place in the late summer. These few butterflies will survive the winter until they can return home and find a mate. A monarch butterfly usually lives for two to six weeks. After she finds a mate, the female lays her eggs and starts the butterfly life cycle all over again.",733.0
" If a snail or slug dries out, it will die.
Snails and slugs can be as tiny as the period on this page, and the largest are the size of rabbits! Snails can have dull, bright, spotted, or striped shells. Many sea slugs are brightly colored with red, blue, purple, silver, or yellow. Most land slugs are brown or green. One slug looks quite a bit like a fruit. It is the banana slug, which lives in the western United States. A banana slug is yellow with black spots, and it can grow as big as a banana.
Like bears, land snails and slugs sleep through cold winters. Snails nap in their shells, and slugs sleep in holes they’ve dug in the dirt. In the spring, they come out. They’re very hungry after they wake up, and they need to find plants to eat.
Snails and slugs spend most of their time searching for food. Land snails and slugs eat live plants, and some eat dead plants, too. They rub their tongues on leaves and stems. Sharp teeth on their tongues grind off bits of plants. Sea snails and slugs eat underwater plants, sponges, and tiny ocean animals.
Almost all snails and slugs lay eggs. When each egg hatches, a baby snail or slug crawls out. How long does a snail or slug live? It depends on the type and size. Small snails and slugs usually live about six months, and large snails and slugs might live eight to ten years.
Some snails and slugs can damage crops and gardens, but snails and slugs are very important. They clean up the world by eating dead plants. They provide a source of food for birds and other animals. Now you know all about the secret lives of snails and slugs!",589.0
" This is to make sure the chocolate has just the right flavor. The beans are roasted in order to bring out the chocolate flavor. This is when the beans begin to smell like chocolate. As the beans are roasted, the thin shell that covers them grows brittle. The beans pass through a machine that cracks their shells and blows away the pieces of shell with fans.
After the shells are removed, only the meaty part of the bean, called the nib, remains. The nibs are ground up and crushed until they become a liquid. The liquid is poured into molds where it cools into bars of bitter, unsweetened chocolate. The bars are then pressed until a yellow liquid, called cocoa butter, is removed. The cocoa butter drains through a screen and is collected to make the chocolate we eat. After the liquid cocoa butter is removed, the solid part of the bar is ground into a powder. Cocoa powder is sent to dairies and bakeries to flavor baked goods and dairy products.
The chocolate we eat is made in the final step of mixing. The mixing takes place in machines with big rollers. Sugar, cocoa powder, cocoa butter, and other ingredients are rolled and mixed until smooth. The smooth mixture is poured into molds and cooled. After it has cooled and solidified, the chocolate is wrapped in packages for shipping.
Most of the chocolate made in factories today is used to make chocolate candy. Other chocolate goes into ice cream, chocolate drinks, and baked goods such as cakes and doughnuts. Each year people around the world consume, or eat, tons of chocolate.
It took a long time for chocolate to become popular throughout the world. Today, people everywhere eat lots of chocolate, making it the world’s most popular sweet.",684.0
" “Can I see that for a second?” Medusa asked. “Sure,” Cy said as he handed over the monocle. “I won’t be using it anyway.”
The school bell rang, and Medusa patted Cy on his shoulder. “I like your one eye,” Medusa said. “We need to get our three eyes over to shop class before we’re late.” Cy smiled. “Hey, shop class...” he said. “That gives me an idea.”
For the next two weeks in shop class, Cy and Medusa sat at a back table together. Cy took measurements of Medusa’s head. He used all the shop tools to build a visor that would keep her from turning people to stone. Finally, Cy polished the completed visor and handed it to Medusa. “Try it out,” he said.
Medusa slipped on the visor. Inside, a system of mirrors allowed her to look at people without making direct eye contact with anybody. Medusa cautiously approached the table next to them. The students peeked up at her, and no one turned to stone. “This is amazing!” Medusa yelled. She walked around the room staring each student in the face.
“You did it, Cy!” Medusa said with a beaming smile. She rushed back to her work station and pulled Cy’s monocle from a drawer. “I hope you don’t mind, but I’ve been working on your monocle.

" The lumberjacks were finally happy, and no one ever quit Paul’s camp. Those pancakes were too good!
When the logging was done in one spot, Paul simply lifted the camp onto wheels, and Babe pulled it to a new place. One time, they set down their camp next to a twisty river in Wisconsin. That river was so crooked that the logs the lumberjacks sent floating down would end up in an awful jam. For weeks at a time, the sawmills downriver were waiting for logs that never came.
Paul sat picking his teeth with a pine tree while he thought about the problem. Paul had Ole, his blacksmith, forge a giant chain. He hooked one end of the chain to Babe’s harness and the other end to a twist in the river. “Pull, Babe!” he commanded, and Babe pulled.
Sweat poured off Babe, but the river wouldn’t budge. “Harder!” Paul said. Babe grunted and pulled harder. The muscles on his neck stood out like tree roots. His legs dug in the earth, and his belly nearly touched the ground, but that old river was as crooked as ever.
Then Paul saw the bend in the river give a shiver. “It’s working!” he cried. Babe let out a bellow that was heard all the way to Kansas. He gave a mighty tug, causing the river to snap like a whip. Then, with a CRACK! it lay straight as a flagpole. Everyone cheered. Paul stuck out his chest with pride so much that his buttons popped off his shirt.
Paul and Babe went on to do many more great things. They were last seen working in the vast wilderness of Alaska. Folks up there say they still sometimes hear a mighty voice in the woods calling out “Timber!” followed by a rumbling “Moo!”",680.0

When it was time for Adriana and Gloria to go home, I gave each of them a colorful calavera. I loved having the special ofrenda in our yard. It reminded me of all the funny things Ratona used to do.
At sunset on the last day of celebrations, my whole family walked to the graveyard to visit Tía Teresa. My two brothers carried bundles of flowers, and I carried a big candle. Every family from the neighborhood came out. The graveyard was full of laughing voices. There was even a mariachi band.
My grandparents were already there, along with Mamá’s brother, Tío Juan, and my cousins. Tía Teresa’s gravestone was piled with flowers, sweet pan de muertos, and twinkling candles. Someone began lighting fireworks. My cousins and brothers dashed away to watch, but Mamá stood by the gravestone. She smiled thoughtfully.
“I have a story about Teresa that I don’t think you know,” Mamá said to me. “One day, Teresa was walking to town. She heard a tiny squeak coming from some tall grass. It was a little gray kitten. She was so tiny that Teresa named her Ratona.” Tío Juan and my grandparents smiled at the memory. “When Teresa died, I took Ratona home,” Mamá continued. “You were just a baby, María, but you loved her right away. You always kept her by your side. Seeing you with Ratona reminded me of Teresa. It made me very happy.”
Everyone in the graveyard was laughing and dancing. Their faces were lit by warm candlelight. I was too young to remember Tía Teresa, but we had both loved Ratona. Thinking about them together made me happy, too. That was what Día de los Muertos was all about. Mamá took my hand and stood up. “I think it’s time to dance!” she said.",587.0

“Climb on up here, sonny, and give me a hand with this wrench!” shouted Frank. “You too, missy!” They climbed up beside the oversized pumpkin and Frank put them to work. For more than an hour, Pablo hammered. Nola glued orange tissue paper in place. They arranged giant fake leaves and vines around the giant fake pumpkin. When they were done, the float looked fantastic.
“So,” Pablo said at last, “I guess you’re all ready for next year’s parade.” Frank looked confused. “Next year?” he cried. “When you’re my age, sonny, you don’t plan for next year! Put your seat belts on—we’ve got a parade to get to!”Just then, Nola and Pablo heard the first notes of a marching band. They blinked in confusion.“Wait a minute,” Nola said. “Wasn’t the parade at ten o’clock today?” “ Was at ten?” Frank cried. “ Will be at ten is more like it!” He thrust his wristwatch toward them. Pablo yawned. “Your watch says 9:30,” he said.Nola laughed for joy. “I fell forward ,” she said. “I needed to fall back.”
Nola had sprung forward an hour when everybody else had fallen back an hour. That meant she and Pablo were now two hours ahead of everybody else. For once in their lives, they were early! “You woke me up two hours early?” Pablo cried. “The early bird gets the worm!” Nola cried.Frank nodded. “You got it now, missy,” he said. Pablo yawned.
It was all a big mistake, but it turned out to be a great mistake. It’s why they rode in the parade on Frank’s giant pumpkin float—and why they’ve ridden with Frank every year since.
It’s also why, from that day to this, Nola O’Connor has made sure to be early for everything. Two minutes early, though—not two hours.",533.0

" They hold water very well because the biggest part of each plant lives underground. They rarely grow more than 2.5 centimeters (1 in.) above the ground and have only two leaves. Once each year, these plants usually grow a white or yellow flower. Their shape helps to hide them so animals do not eat them.
Some cactus plants are covered with wool-like hairs. These plants come from Bolivia and Peru, high in the Andes Mountains of South America. The “wool” protects them from daytime heat and nighttime cold. The “wool” also helps the cactus plants hold moisture.
Some trees and shrubs grow out of solid rock. They grow up high where the wind blows strong. The wind can blow seeds into small cracks in the rock. When rain gets into the cracks, the seeds start to grow. Their roots reach down into small cracks for moisture. Once the roots are stable, the plants grow leaves to absorb sunlight and are then able to keep growing. As the roots grow, they split the rock.
Some plants have animals living inside them. Ant colonies live within ant plants. The ants protect the plant from animals that would eat it. The ants use natural cavities, or spaces, in the plant’s stem as houses. Some spaces are used for raising young ants. Other spaces are used for garbage. The ant plant uses some of this garbage for food and to spread its seeds.

On the twelfth morning, the happy family took off his glimmering lights, glass ornaments, and the wooden ones, too. They took him outside. He felt a gust of cold air, and he trembled. They leaned him against a fence and left him there. It was dark and cold outside. He was lonely. He hummed quietly to himself and talked to the moon. He remembered the tunes that the family had sung on the night Santa came.
Over many months, the fir tree felt the air around him grow warmer. He longed to be decked in twinkling lights and shining ornaments again. He wanted to see his forest home and talk to the birds. He wanted to tell the oaks about what he had seen. He wanted to tell the other evergreens about being chosen by a family, and about the two most glorious days of his life.
One day, the fir tree felt his needles and branches tickled by a spring rain. The fir tree almost laughed with delight. Above him, the Sun shone brightly and the air smelled of earth. Birds chirped in nearby trees. One of the happy people furrowed the dirt near him to plant a garden. It was a woman from the family. She hummed a song he had never heard. It was the sweetest sound.
The fir tree spent several weeks listening to the woman work. She had planted seeds, and they were starting to grow. “Now life is beginning again,” said the tree, rejoicing in the sunshine and fresh air.

" “Mom, do we have a book about time travel?” Leroy asked.
“Sorry, Leroy,” Mom said, “but the library might. Let’s go see.”
The librarian asked Leroy’s mother to pretend she was the Sun, and Leroy to play planet Earth.
Next, she told him to spin like a top while also circling his mom.“Every time you complete a spin, one day passes,” the librarian told Leroy.
“You also move a little bit in a big loop around the Sun,” the librarian said. “One full loop is one year. That’s 365 spins—or days—on your journey.”
“Over time, people figured out that a year was not exactly 365 days,” the librarian explained. “To complete a full year, you have to spin a little bit more. You need an extra quarter of a turn, or six hours, every year. In four years, that adds up to one full extra day, a special year with 366 days.”“Calendars would not work without leap years ,” she added. “In a hundred years, summer would start almost a month later.”
“Why are they called leap years? ” Leroy asked.The librarian smiled. “Say New Year’s Eve was Sunday last year. Usually that means it would be Monday this year, but in a leap year, it would be Tuesday. It would ‘skip’ or ‘leap’ ahead a full day.”Leroy laughed in amazement. He finally understood!
When he returned home from the library, Leroy’s friends sprang out at him. “Happy birthday!” they shouted.They hadn’t forgotten, and neither had Mom. They just wanted to surprise him.
Mom brought out a cake with eight candles. Six were blue and two red—Leroy’s favorite color—for his special leap year birthdays.
“When you were born, my heart leaped for joy,” Mom said.
Mom beamed at Leroy like the Sun beams at the Earth. Leroy beamed back.",571.0

Sports such as soccer and ice hockey are popular in Russia. Russia is famous for music and a kind of dance show called ballet. Swan Lake is a famous Russian ballet.
The land in Russia is mainly low flatlands, high flatlands, and mountains. The deepest lake in the world, Lake Baikal, is in Russia. Russia has frozen flatlands in the north and wide grassy lands in the south. In between are huge forests.
Russia is a cold country, and it is home to the coldest village in the world. But many places in Russia also have beautiful summers.
In the past, czars, or emperors, ruled Russia. During that time, the peasants in Russia were unhappy. They didn’t like the way the czars ruled the people. They fought in 1917 to change their country’s ways.
After the fight, Russia took control of a group of other nearby countries. Together they formed the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). The USSR had many problems, so it broke up in 1991. Today, Russia has a president.
Many people celebrate Christmas and Easter in Russia. On Easter, they eat cakes and paint hard-boiled eggs. Russians also have a holiday to celebrate the end of winter. For this holiday, people eat pancakes with butter. They also have fun with sleigh rides and snowball fights.
A popular soup in Russia is famous around the world. People make the soup from beets and other vegetables. Beets are red, so the soup also has a red color. Many Russians like a homemade drink. The drink has a sour flavor.
Russia is home to both crowded cities and wild forests. Russia has a long, rich history and many interesting things to do. The Russian people value the traditions of their beautiful homeland.",687.0
"S. states. At last, it will reach the Gulf of Mexico.
At first, the river flows through dozens of locks and dams. Together, they make it safe for boats to travel. They hold back water so boats don’t hit the river bottom.
Boats on this part of the river carry corn and soybeans south. Much of this food is shipped around the world.
More than fifty kinds of mammals live along the upper river. River otters love to play here.
Farther down, a big, muddy river comes in from the west. It mixes with the clear waters of the Mississippi. The river grows brown and wide.
For the next 190 miles (306 km), the river runs through areas with many wild animals. Bald eagles nest in the tall trees. They eat the fish that swim in the river.
Another big river joins the Mississippi from the east. The river grows deep and even wider. In many spots, it stretches 1.5 miles (2.4 km) across.
With so much water, the Mississippi is famous for its floods. They can cause a lot of damage, but they’re not all bad. Along the river’s banks, the floods leave behind rich soil for farming.
More cities rise up here, and the boats carry iron and steel, rubber, and wood. They carry farm crops such as cotton from the area, too. Some things move north, back up the river, and some move farther south.
Several types of turtles call this part of the river home. So do alligators!
Finally, the Mississippi flows into the Gulf of Mexico. The rain that fell in Lake Itasca three months ago has reached the sea. Someday, some of that water may return as rain to Lake Itasca. It may make the journey all over again. And again...",569.0
"” Their regular teacher, who was back at school, told Bobby to apologize. Then the teacher had an idea. The students would present oral reports about their first names.
At the library that afternoon, Frank found out that many famous people had the name Francis. There was a young man from Italy who gave up his family’s money 800 years ago. He went on to become Saint Francis, who was famous for talking to animals.
There was a famous explorer named Sir Francis Drake. He sailed around the world more than 400 years ago! There were many kings named Francis, too.
Over the weekend, Frank’s mother said something else about his name. “Do you know you were named after a hero?” she asked. “Long ago, your great-great-great-grandmother’s ship sank. She was just a kid. But she grabbed a piece of wood and swam five miles to shore while holding on to her little brother. She saved his life. Her name was Frances Hightower.” Francis might not be a girl’s name, but he was named after a girl—an awesome girl!
On Monday, Frank told the story of his name. He talked about the saint and the kings. He talked about the famous explorer. Then he said he wasn’t named after any of those people. He was named after his great-great-great-grandmother, the hero. When he finished the story about Frances Hightower, the whole class clapped—even Bobby.
Sometimes, during the perfectly good week that followed, Frank’s friends called him Francis. Frank liked having two names, one of them from a real hero. It made him want to be heroic, even if that just meant being kind or helping a dog. From then on, whenever he did heroic deeds or even thought heroic thoughts, Frank signed his own name as Francis... a perfectly good name.",744.0
" For many years, the Victoria Tower was the largest square stone tower in the world. The Elizabeth Tower is the clock tower that holds Big Ben. The Central Tower was planned as a chimney for smoke from fireplaces inside the palace.
Westminster Palace is home to Parliament. Parliament is where people make laws for the United Kingdom. There are two houses in Parliament. People in the House of Commons help to decide what laws to make. They debate what the people need.
People in the House of Lords have titles, such as Lord and Lady. Others are important members of the Church of England. The House of Lords works with the House of Commons to make laws. When everyone agrees, the laws become Acts of Parliament.
Big Ben’s clock tells exactly the right time. People take good care of it. It takes a long time to clean the clock faces. People clean them every five years with soap and water. With its four faces, Big Ben is the biggest chiming clock in the world.
People who live in the United Kingdom can go to the top of the Elizabeth Tower and see Big Ben. There, they also get a great view of London and can see how the clocks work. Anyone can go to the Houses of Parliament, though. Everyone can take pictures of the clock tower from the outside.
Every New Year’s Eve, there is a huge fireworks show when Big Ben finishes chiming at midnight. Many people come from all over the United Kingdom to see the show. Big Ben always looks amazing on that night.
Big Ben is important to the British people. They hear its chimes every day on the radio and television. When bombs damaged one of Big Ben’s clock faces, the bells kept on chiming. Big Ben never stops!",688.0
" They have snake carvings and tall columns.
The Maya did not use wheels, so they couldn’t carry stones in wagons. They didn’t have horses to drag heavy things, either. Every stone had to be carried to the city and put in place by Maya workers.
The Maya had an important reason to build a city where they did. This part of Mexico has no rivers or lakes. Instead, fresh water comes up from underground wells called cenotes (si-NOH-teez). Chichén Itzá had two cenotes.
The wells were important for drinking water. The Maya also put gifts in the water for Chac, their rain god. If Chac liked the gifts, they believed he would send rain to help their corn and other vegetables grow.
The Maya believed in many gods and gave gifts to each one. Many of the buildings at Chichén Itzá were temples. El Castillo had a temple at the top for a god that looked like a snake with wings. Scientists are learning about what this god meant to the Maya people.
More than one million people visit Chichén Itzá each year! Many people climbed the steps at El Castillo. Over time, the steps became slippery and dangerous. The people of Mexico are keeping the building and visitors safe. Today, visitors are not allowed to climb the steps.
It is still fun to visit the city, though. Twice a year, many people come to see a special show. On those two days, the Sun makes shadows on the castle. The shadows look like a snake on the side of the stairs!
Some of the most amazing Maya buildings are in Chichén Itzá. In fact, the city was chosen as one of the New Seven Wonders of the World. Maybe you will visit it one day!",719.0

A ghost town in Italy sits on a tall cliff. People in the village left because of earthquakes and landslides. In the 1960s and 1970s, landslides almost destroyed the whole village. The people who still lived there moved away.
People leave some places after the land turns deadly. A town in Pennsylvania is almost completely empty. One day in 1962, the town dump was set on fire to clean up for a holiday. The fire spread into the old mines below the dump, and no one could stop it.
After many years, the fire started to burn under the town. Deadly gas went into people’s homes, and holes opened up in the ground. Almost everyone left. The fire will burn for a long time.
Water can be as deadly as fire. A large earthquake hit off the coast of Japan in March 2011. The earthquake caused huge waves that hit a nuclear power plant. Harmful radiation filled the air. Thousands of people had to move away. No one knows when—or if—anyone can go back.
People leave some places because they are too hard to get to. In this group of small islands, people couldn’t grow enough food or heat their homes. Young people moved away. Others died because of poor health or old age. The last people moved away in 1930.
Most ghost towns are not empty from the start. People found coal in an area of China in the early 2000s. A city was built nearby, and people were expected to move there. The new city has always been empty. It is the world’s largest ghost town.
Ghost towns can be old or new, and they are created in many different ways. However, they all have one thing in common: they are lonely places with secrets to share.",606.0
" He decided to hide behind the mountains. As he slowly began to sink, beautiful shadows appeared along the horizon. All of the desert animals came out to see them. “Much better,” said Roadrunner. She dashed after a small lizard that had come out to see the shadows.
“Go away, Sun!” said Kangaroo Rat. “You’re still shining on the tops of the mountains! I’m hungry, and I’d like to gather my food without you around.”
Kangaroo Rat’s cold words made Sun disappear over the horizon. As he went, he created a dusty rose and orange sunset. “Much better,” said Kangaroo Rat. She left her burrow in search of food.
Night fell, and the desert air and sand began to cool. Jackrabbit fed on grasses while keeping a watch out for enemies. Rattlesnake stayed close to his den, searching for small rodents to eat. Roadrunner dined on tasty lizards. Kangaroo Rat gathered seeds.
The animals noticed that it had been dark for quite some time. Sun had not appeared as usual. They began to wonder what had happened to him. “Come back, Sun!” said Jackrabbit. “How am I supposed to rest in total darkness?” “Come back, Sun!” said Rattlesnake. “How am I supposed to sun myself on the rocks?”
“Come back, Sun!” said Roadrunner. “How am I supposed to warm myself from this cool night air? I haven’t had a chance to build my nest of sticks.” “ Come back, Sun!” said Kangaroo Rat. “How am I supposed to dry the seeds that I’ve spent all night collecting?”

" In a zombie mud run, racers have to run away from people dressed as zombies. Racers can choose to be the ones running from zombies or become zombies themselves and chase others. Which would you rather be?
Even in regular races, runners often dress up in costumes just for fun. You might dress up as a nurse, a superhero, or your grandma for your mud run. The only limit is your imagination! Costumes get completely covered in mud, and most costumes also get torn during the race. It’s all part of the fun.
If you don’t want to race alone, you can team up with your family or friends. Your team members might help each other get past an obstacle. Some races force teams to push and pull each other over a wall covered in slippery mud. Mud runs are hard, and teamwork can help everyone have a good time.
You don’t have to be a serious athlete to race in a mud run. Many people run just for fun.
Some mud runs are made for children as young as three. The children’s races are shorter, but they still have obstacles, mud, and lots of adventure. You might climb a kid-sized wall or wiggle through a kid-sized tunnel during the run. Whichever run you choose, you’re in for a good time! Children sometimes have so much fun on these courses that they run them two or three times.
You’re near the end of your first mud run. You’re running for the finish when— squelch —you step into a huge pool of wet, sticky mud. The mud sucks at your shoes and sticks to your clothes, but you power through it. You’re not wearing a costume, but you still feel like a superhero as you cross the finish line.",832.0

The main way ants communicate is by smell. They release chemicals that other ants can smell long after the first ant is gone. Different smells send different messages. For example, a crushed ant releases chemicals that attract other ants. The chemicals also make the other ants attack anything nearby that might be a danger. An ant that has found food will lay down a trail of chemicals for other ants to follow. The trail allows them to find the food and return to the colony.
Ant colonies are filled with activity. Usually built underground, they have many different rooms, which all have different uses. Some rooms store food, while others are used to care for the young. Colonies even have rooms for ants to relax in.
Within the colony, every ant has a job. Worker ants and soldier ants find food and protect the nest. These are usually the ants you see above the ground. Other ants build the nest, take care of the young, and do other jobs. All these ants are female, but only one is allowed to lay eggs: the queen. In other words, all the ants in a colony are related.
The queen is the leader of the colony. The largest of all the ants, queens are egg-laying machines. Some queens can lay thousands of eggs every day. They can also live longer than most other insects—over twenty-five years.
Ants may be small, but they can do awesome things. Thousands or millions of ants working together can build bridges or float across rivers. They can overpower animals hundreds of times their own size for food.
So the next time you come across a trail of ants, stop and watch or, better yet, follow them. When you see what these little gals are capable of, you’ll understand just how awesome they are.",735.0
" “I’d play that new Boy Band Extreme song that’s always on the radio. That song would make anyone run for the hills,” she said.
Sam chuckled and drew in his notepad. He imagined the terrified bear scurrying to the top of the tree to escape the noise. “If you play that Boy Band Extreme song, the bear will never come down,” Sam said.
As they giggled at Sam’s drawing, some nuts fell near the base of the tree. “Look, the bear’s eating something up there,” Sarah said. “He’s probably found some nuts that were stashed away by squirrels,” Mrs. Miller said.
“I’ve got it!” Sam shouted. He scribbled his plan in the notepad and showed Sarah and his mom. “We’ll collect a big pile of nuts and make a trail leading back to the forest,” Sam said. “We can toss nuts under the tree so we don’t have to get too close to the bear,” he added. “Let’s get nuts!” Sarah yelled.
“All right, let’s try it,” Mrs. Miller said. “Good job sketching out your ideas first.” Sam dropped his sketchbook and sprinted to the chestnut tree in the backyard. Sarah and her mother grabbed two large paper bags from the kitchen and met Sam out back. “We’re going to get that bear out of the tree!” Sam shouted. “I’m one-hundred percent sure this plan will work.”
While they were filling the bags with chestnuts, the brown bear climbed down from the tree. Sam was so busy with his plan he didn’t notice the bear was leaving. He returned just in time to see the bear disappear into the woods behind the neighbors’ house.

" “No! You are covered in ash and have no nice clothes,” she spat. Cinderella wept. The stepsisters laughed on their way out the door to the ball.
Cinderella ran to her mother’s grave. She sat down under the tree and cried out, “Shake and quiver, little tree. Throw gold and silver down to me.” The white bird appeared, throwing down a silver dress and golden slippers. Then the bird warned, “Gold and silver, time will pass. By midnight, riches turn to ash.”
Cinderella dressed and ran to the ball. She was so clean and beautiful that even her stepsisters did not recognize her. At the ball, the prince danced with every maiden. When Cinderella appeared, he was taken with her beauty. “You will be my only dance partner from now on,” he declared.
When the clock struck midnight, Cinderella fled, for she knew the magic would end then. In her hurry, she lost one golden slipper.
With slipper in hand, the prince searched for his dance partner all the next day. He had every maiden try it on. It fit no one. His final stop was Cinderella’s house. The stepsisters tried and tried, but no amount of pushing or pulling worked.
The prince was beside himself. “Is there no other?” he cried. Just then, he saw Cinderella sweeping the hearth. “Who is she?” he asked. “That’s just the maid. Pay her no mind,” replied the stepmother. Ignoring her, the prince insisted that Cinderella try on the slipper.
It fit perfectly. When Cinderella stood up and looked into the prince’s eyes, he knew she was his dance partner. “You are the one I seek!” he declared. The prince and Cinderella married and lived happily ever after. And the stepsisters? They lived unhappily ever after, just as they deserved.",605.0
" What can you do to help your players out?”
“That’s how we can use the toaster!” Jody exclaimed. “If the unicorn gets in trouble, the toaster can come in and burn up all the plants.” “Great, but players only get one toaster per game,” said Nina.
They divided up the work. Matt started on the story while Nina took charge of the design. Jody worked to get the programming done quickly. Nina had just enough time to add little touches to her drawings. She was especially proud of her houseplants. She added frowns to their faces to make them look mean and funny at the same time.
“Those plants are great,” Jody said when Nina showed them to her. “We’re almost out of time, and I could use some help. Do you think you could add the houseplants yourself? I’ll show you how to do the animation.” They worked together for the rest of the day.
On the last day of camp, they showed their game to the whole group in the big hall. As the unicorn fought through the rooms, the houseplants got bigger and meaner. Just when things looked scariest for the unicorn, Jody called up the toaster to save the day. The whole camp clapped and cheered.

" The audience does not see the actual puppet. They see just the puppet’s shadow cast on a screen. Since only the shadow is seen, there is no need to add details such as a painted face to a shadow puppet. Still, many shadow puppets are created with great detail.
It is possible to add color to a shadow puppet’s shadow. An easy way to do this is to first cut holes in the main body of the puppet. Then cover the holes with colored material that light can pass through, such as colored tissue paper or cellophane.
Many puppeteers like to be hidden. This makes it easier for people watching to use their imaginations during a puppet show. The type of stage used for a puppet show depends on the type of puppets. A table, a large box, or the floor can be used as a stage. A blanket tacked halfway up a doorway will also work.
One of the most famous puppeteers of all time was Jim Henson. Jim created the Muppets, including Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy. He also created the Sesame Street characters, including Bert and Ernie, Oscar the Grouch, Grover, Cookie Monster, and Big Bird.
Many of the materials for making puppets can be found around your house. Others do not cost much and can be found at a craft store. You can even find puppet materials at yard sales!
This book is just an introduction to the wonderful world of puppets. You can find more information and ideas for making puppets at your library or on the Internet. Remember—when it comes to imagination, just about anything is possible. If you can imagine a puppet, there’s probably a way to make it. Have fun!",894.0

King Bear refused to believe he had subjects from a garden patch. He demanded that the melon pay respects to him if the animals spoke the truth. “The watermelon just sat there, mum for the first time all day. “What kind of joke is this?” the king grumbled. “The melon remained silent.

" “What’s that horse doing out there?” Bill asked. “Her name’s Widow-Maker,” said the outlaws. “There’s not a man alive that can ride that horse.” Quick as a whistle, Bill was on the black horse’s back. She bucked. She kicked. She tossed Bill as high as the clouds, but Bill still landed on her back. For three days and nights, Widow-Maker tried to throw Bill to the ground. Finally, the horse realized she had met her match and decided to be friends.
One day in early spring, a storm came roaring in over the desert. Lightning flashed like fireworks, and rain pelted the rocks. The storm grew into a tornado. It swept up the snake, Curly Joe, and Widow-Maker and twisted them into the sky. Acting fast to save his friends, Bill used his lasso to catch the ugly tornado by the tail. The twister spun him like an out-of-control locomotive. Bill hung onto his rope as the tornado pulled him high into the air.
Though he was miles above the ground, Bill wasn’t worried. He put one hand over the other on his rope and climbed to the top of the tornado. He rode that tornado like a wild bronco. The tornado twisted and turned until it finally put the snake, Widow-Maker, and Curly Joe safely back on the ground.
“Yippee!” Bill yelled as he kicked the tornado again. This time, the tornado spun toward a rainbow that was in their path. Bill lassoed the rainbow and pulled it down to the desert.

The guide showed us some holes in the wall. Miners filled the holes with sticks of dynamite and wired them to blow up the rock. The miners would blast the rock at the end of their shift. After a blast, the air would be thick with dust, making the air heavy and hard to breathe.
We went to another part of the mine before we headed back to the top. This part was a big room with lots of little cubbyholes. The tour guide asked us to shine our lights on different parts of the room. I couldn’t believe it! Every now and then, a light would glance off something with a dull shine. He said that was malachite, a beautiful green mineral often found with copper ore.
At one point in our tour, the guide had us all turn off our lamps. Oh, my gosh, it was so dark. I had never been in total darkness before. There was absolutely no light. I held my hand right in front of my face and I couldn’t even see it. Just as I was beginning to feel scared, the guide had us turn our lamps back on.
When we got back to the top and the tour was done, I was happy to feel the sunshine. I couldn’t wait to get out of the slicker, heavy belt, and hardhat. I ditched the gear where the guide said to, then ran to the fire to warm up. I couldn’t believe I was so cold, but I was.

“Why don’t we take a walk so you can meet Mabel?” said Ms. Vega. Ben led the rest of the students into a large barn with many stalls. Marcos squinted to see in the barn’s dim light. What he saw made him stop in his tracks. There, in the second stall, was a llama.
Marcos began speaking softly to the animal in Spanish. As if it understood, the llama bent its long neck toward him. Marcos reached up and stroked the gentle animal’s fur as it nibbled on hay.
Ms. Vega watched Marcos with interest. “Do you like llamas?” she asked. Marcos nodded. “ Sí. I mean, yes,” he replied shyly. “My grandfather had a ranch in Ecuador with many llamas.” “Paco here came from Ecuador, too,” said Ms. Vega. “He is sort of a test.

“Oh, that’s Finn’s bread,” said Oonagh. “He loves it. The only people who can eat it are Finn and Finn Junior, here.” Oonagh handed a loaf to Finn, who was still tucked inside the cradle. Finn followed Oonagh’s lead and ate the bread in two bites. Of course, Finn’s loaf had no frying pan. Cucullin watched, amazed. He grabbed another loaf, and then another. “Ouch!” he roared as three more teeth came out.
“Maybe you would like some cheese instead?” Oonagh offered. She set a round white stone on Cucullin’s plate. Oonagh handed Finn the soft cheese, which looked just like a stone. Finn, babbling like an infant, squeezed the cheese until the moisture poured out. Then he swallowed it in one bite.
Cucullin could not be outdone by a baby. He picked up the stone and squeezed and squeezed, but the stone stayed dry. He bit down. “Hooo!” he screamed. He’d lost four more teeth! “That baby must have teeth of iron! Let me take a look,” he said. Cucullin leaned over the cradle and reached for Finn’s mouth. Finn nearly fled, but Oonagh’s steady look kept him calm.
Cucullin pushed Finn’s mouth open with one thumb. Chomp! “Baaaagh! My thumb! He’s broken my thumb!” Cucullin screamed. “There’s no way I’ll fight the father of that baby!”
Cucullin fled across the bridge to Scotland. Then he turned and smashed the bridge to pieces so Finn McCool couldn’t follow him. You can still see its remains on the coast today.",545.0
" Every spring, hundreds of thousands of seabirds nest on this island. We had arrived at the perfect time because the birds had just arrived on the island the day before. The birds are mainly Heermann’s gulls, elegant terns, and royal terns. The noise they make is deafening. We had to walk very carefully to make sure we didn’t step on any nests or eggs.
Today was our last day on the ship. I am writing this at the airport while waiting for the plane to take us home. This morning, we went ashore at Bahia de Los Angeles. There were buses waiting to take us to the boojum forest. I didn’t know what a boojum was, but I soon found out. A boojum was a most peculiar tree. It looked like an upside down carrot, but was very, very tall. There were hundreds of these trees in the desert forest. We hiked for a mile or so into the boojum forest. I loved the boojums because I had never seen anything quite like them. The desert forest was the only place on Earth we could see them.
In the afternoon, we sailed toward our last stop—Guaymas. On the way, we were very lucky because we saw many marine mammals. It was as if they had all come to say goodbye. We saw four fin whales swimming together. They are the second largest whales in the ocean.
A little while later, eight pilot whales swam along with the ship. They were very small. It was fun watching them jump out of the water. Finally, a friendly dolphin and a pelican stopped by to say farewell. This is the end of my cruise journal. I will always remember this wonderful vacation and the new friends that I have made.",622.0
" On the outside, a bone is hard and solid. This part is the compact bone. Below the compact bone is the spongy bone. Spongy bone has holes to keep the bones light so our muscles can lift them. Inside the spongy bone is bone marrow. The body uses bone marrow to make blood cells. About half a pound of bone marrow makes about 50 billion red blood cells every day!
Even though bones are strong, they can break if they are hit hard enough. Broken bones can be fixed. Healing a broken bone takes a little help from a doctor and a lot of help from bone cells. For a bone to heal correctly, the bone must be put back the way it was before the break. Doctors may move broken bones to put them back in place. They set a cast around the body part where the bone was broken. The cast keeps the body part from moving so the bone can heal. As soon as a bone breaks, bone cells begin repairing it. Holding the broken bone in place with a cast lets the bone cells do their job.
Bones need to stay healthy to remain strong. Exercising regularly is the best way to keep your bones in good working order. Eating a well-balanced diet helps the bone marrow to produce healthy blood cells. Legumes (such as peas or pinto beans), other vegetables, and fruits are good for your bones. Foods rich in calcium, such as dairy products and fortified soy milk, rice milk, and orange juice, can also help bones to grow. Bones give your body its shape, and they also give you much more. They allow you to move, sit, stand, and write. You wouldn’t be you without your bones!",728.0
"How Fast?
How fast can you run? How fast can you swim? Humans are slow compared to some animals. Which animals are the fastest?
The fastest runner is the cheetah. It can go as fast as a car on a highway! Cheetahs can only run that speed for a short time, though. They sprint to catch prey.
Cheetahs eat gazelles, which are not quite as fast as cheetahs. Gazelles can run fast for a longer time, though.
Small animals are slower than big animals, but some go fast for their size. The tiger beetle runs 170 times the length of its body in one second. If humans could do that, they could race jet planes!
Turtles are slow on land, yet the world’s fastest reptile is a turtle! It can swim four times as fast as a human.
The fastest animal in the sea is the sailfish. In a race, it can easily beat most motorboats. Its cousin the swordfish is almost as fast.
Flying is the fastest way to get around. Some of the fastest animals are birds, bats, and insects. Dragonflies are the fastest insects. They catch and eat other flying insects. They can even fly backwards!
The fastest animal on Earth is the peregrine falcon. It hunts other birds by diving on them from above. During a dive, it tucks in its wings and sails straight down.
Cheetahs run as fast as a car. Sailfish swim faster than a motorboat. Falcons dive as fast as an airplane. Animals can reach amazing speeds!",592.0
" All mud runs are the same in one way. People get very muddy!
Running through mud isn’t easy. The mud sticks to your shoes and slows you down. It’s hard to move forward. The people who plan mud runs know this. They use mud to make parts of the course hard.
Racers need to be strong to climb over nets and walls. They need to be careful to get past parts like the balance beam.
They need to get down into the mud to crawl under walls or through tunnels. They need to be brave to slide down big hills or even jump over fire!
Some mud runs have an extra twist, such as monsters. In a zombie mud run, racers run away from people dressed as zombies. Racers can run from zombies or choose to become zombies and chase others. Which would you rather be?
At many races, runners often dress up in costumes just for fun. Costumes get covered in mud, and many also get torn during the race. It’s all part of the fun.
People run as teams in some mud runs. They push and pull each other over walls covered in mud. Mud runs are hard, and working as a team can help everyone have a good time.
You don’t have to be great at sports to race in a mud run. Many people run just for fun.
Some mud runs are made for children as young as three. The children’s races are shorter, but they have tricky parts, mud, and lots of adventure. You might climb a kid-sized wall. You might wiggle through a kid-sized tunnel.
If you choose to run, you’re in for a good time! Children sometimes have so much fun that they run the races two or three times.
In a mud run, even regular people can feel like superheroes!",581.0
" Each musher would give the medicine to the next team along the way. When the medicine arrived by train, it was handed to the first team, and the race was on.
The dogs battled through rough wilderness in the bitter cold. Often, the medicine had to be warmed by a fire to keep it from freezing. Some of the dogs did not survive the journey.
A famous musher and his lead dog, Togo, covered the most dangerous part of the run.
To save time, they raced over an area of frozen sea. The next day, they raced up snow-packed mountains. They covered 91 miles (146 km)—more than any other team.
The sled dog teams continued their difficult journey. Another musher and his lead dog, Balto, left on the second to last leg in a terrible blizzard.
Balto led the team through the storm. At one point, a gust of wind flipped the sled over. The medicine fell in a snowbank. Balto’s musher dug it out with frozen hands.
When Balto’s team arrived at the hand-off point, the next team was not ready to leave. Balto’s team continued on to Nome instead. Five and a half days after the relay began, Balto’s team delivered the medicine. The children were saved.
After the race, Togo, his musher, and their team went all over the United States. They drew large crowds.
A statue of Balto was built in a city park. Balto and some of his teammates were in a dog show. They were not treated well and were kept in small cages. People gave money to bring the dogs to Cleveland, Ohio. They stayed in a zoo for the rest of their lives. Balto is famous for his bravery. However, every sled dog on that journey helped save the sick children when there was little hope left.",615.0
" The land and the animals that live there are protected.
Time and erosion helped form the Grand Canyon. Erosion happens when bits of the ground are worn away. For millions of years, the Colorado River ran over and wore away the earth until a canyon was made. The rocks at the bottom of the canyon are almost two billion years old.
The Grand Canyon is striped with colors. The stripes are layers of sediment that stacked on top of each other over many years. Each layer helps us learn how Earth has changed over time.
Native Americans have been coming to the Grand Canyon for at least twelve thousand years. Many tribes lived in the area. They camped, hunted, and grew food there. They built into the sides of the canyon.
In the 1850s, Americans had not seen much of the Grand Canyon. In 1869, John Wesley Powell led a dangerous trip down the Colorado River. It was the first recorded trip of its kind.
After the United States made it a national park, more people took trips to the Grand Canyon.
Today, millions of people visit Grand Canyon National Park. Some people hike to the bottom of the canyon and explore for weeks.
People like to raft on the Colorado River. The river winds through the canyon for about 277 miles (446 km). It can be rough, fast, and rocky, making for a grand adventure.
People also love to walk on trails along the rim of the canyon. They can look out at miles of red and yellow walls and watch shadows move across the cliffs.
The Grand Canyon is one of the most amazing sights in nature. Its land, animals, and history will be protected for years to come. Everyone who visits this national park is in for an adventure—and a view—unlike anything else.",693.0

" If measured to the shoulders, a full-grown gray wolf can be as tall as a tabletop. It can be 1.2 meters (4 ft) long from its nose to the base of its tail. A male wolf can weigh 59 kilograms (130 lbs). Wolves have extremely powerful jaws. A wolf’s bite is five times stronger than a human’s and two times stronger than a large dog’s.
Gray wolves aren’t just gray. Their thick, warm fur can be tan to pure black. Wolves have wide feet to help them walk on top of snow.
Wolf Packs Wolves live in groups called packs. An average pack has from 5 to 9 wolves. Wolves have been known to travel in packs of up to 30. The pack is made up of one male leader, one female leader, and their offspring. The male and female leaders are called alphas (AL-fas). The offspring stay with the pack until they are two or three years old, when they leave to look for mates. The offspring and their mates then have pups and start new packs.
Working in packs enables wolves to hunt large animals. Wolves hunt deer, elk, moose, and other animals. They also hunt smaller animals such as rabbits. Pack members use the position of their ears, mouths, and tails to communicate. They also use barks, whimpers, and howls. Wolves smell and lick each other, too.
In spring, the alpha female wolf digs a long tunnel with a den at the end. In the protection of the den, she gives birth to 4 to 6 pups. The pups are born blind and deaf, and they weigh only about as much as a can of soup.
The pups nurse for about two months. Then they enjoy warm meals of meat that their parents regurgitate for them.",577.0
" A little rain falls in the mountains. Inland, the UAE is mostly made up of desert. There it is even hotter. In summer or winter, wind may carry dust and sand. The wind creates huge sand hills.
Only a few grasses and bushes grow in most parts of the desert. There is more water in an oasis. Plants and animals can live there. Dates, grain, mangoes, and other foods grow in an oasis. These spots also help animals live.
People have lived in the UAE for thousands of years. The area has always been important for trade. In the 1800s, Great Britain took over the states to control trade. They traded for things such as tea and silk from Asia. Though trade passed through the states, most villages stayed poor for hundreds of years. In 1958, people looking for oil found it in the Middle East. They quickly began drilling to get the oil.
The British ruled the area for hundreds of years. In 1968, the states decided to form one country. When all seven states joined, the UAE was free from Britain. The country grew rich with its oil.
The Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque is one of the most beautiful UAE buildings. The mosque is important to the religion of Islam. Islam teaches respect, peace, and love. The Burj Khalifa in Dubai sets the record as the tallest building in the world. It stands for everything that is possible in Dubai.

" Workers used a special way of building to make them. The builders stacked stones to form the walls. They did not use any mortar to keep the stones together. That way, all the rainwater could drain out through the cracks. Even heavy rain would not damage the walls. This way of building also helped protect the walls in an earthquake. Some of the stone walls from the early 1600s still stand today.
The Imperial Palace in Tokyo has four areas. They are the Imperial Palace Outer Garden, Kitanomaru Park, the East Gardens, and the Imperial Palace inner grounds.
The Imperial Palace Outer Garden is a free park. The Nijubashi Bridge is a famous bridge in this area. The East Gardens are also open for people to visit. The East Gardens are beautiful all year. Some of the oldest buildings and walls in this area are from the 1600s.

" Kites were also used as flying targets for shooting practice. These special kites could turn and dodge bullets, imitating the movements of fighter planes.
Today, kites are used mostly for fun. There is a kite design for everyone. You’ll discover that different shapes of kites fly in different ways. Flat, diamond-shaped kites fly easily and smoothly. Rectangular box kites hang still in the air for a long time. Stunt kites twist and twirl on many strings. Large parafoil kites are like parachutes. Giant dragon kites flutter. Fighting kites can be used to cut other kites’ strings.
Step 1: Form a cross shape with the sticks. Wrap tape around the sticks where they meet.
Step 2: Cut off a 4-foot (120 cm) piece of string. Tape each end of the string to each end of the long stick. This string is called the bridle. Tie one end of the rest of the string to the middle of the bridle.
Step 3: Lay the cross on the open plastic bag. Cut a diamond shape around it. Make sure to cut the diamond shape wider than the ends of the sticks.
Step 4: Fold the corners of the diamond over the ends of the sticks. Tape the corners tightly to the sticks.
Step 5: For a tail, tape the strip of cloth or plastic to the bottom of the kite.
On a breezy day, take your kite to a flat, open area. Be sure that there are no power lines or big trees. Look at the ground around you. Is there anything you could trip over? Hold your kite up by the bridle and run into the wind. Let go of the kite and slowly let out some string. Then let out a little more until your kite is flying high in the sky. Happy flying!",581.0

Now you are ready to prepare the food.
Measure two cups of rice. Place the rice in a strainer. Rinse well with cold water. Place the clean rice in the pan. Add three cups of water. Place the pan on the stove. Bring the water to a boil. Boil until the rice absorbs most of the water. Cover the pan with a lid. Simmer over low heat for 15 minutes. Two cups of uncooked rice will become 6 cups of fluffy rice.
Serve rice as the base for a great meal. Rice is good with many Chinese dishes. For example, it is good with sweet and sour pork, orange chicken, and beef broccoli. Or you can serve rice with steaks, fish, or chili and beans.
Now it is time to get to work. You will need an adult to do the cutting. Chop the green onions on the cutting board. Cut the chicken breast into small strips. In one small bowl, beat the eggs with a fork. In the other small bowl, measure what you need for the sauce. Then mix those ingredients together.
Now it’s time to cook. Make sure you have an adult around to help. Heat the vegetable oil in the frying pan. Stir-fry the eggs until scrambled, about1 minute. Add the green onions, chicken, and peas. Stir them over a high heat, for about 2 minutes. Add the rice and sauce, and stir for 2 more minutes. Taste to see if you need a pinch of salt or pepper. Serve while it’s hot.

Some plants look like stones. The plants in this picture are called “stone plants” or “living stones.” They live in very hot, dry places such as South Africa. They hold water very well because the biggest part of each plant lives underground. These plants usually have only two leaves. Their shape helps to hide them so that animals do not eat them.
Some cactus plants are covered with wool-like hairs. These plants come from the Andes Mountains in South America. The “wool” protects them from daytime heat and nighttime cold. The “wool” also helps the cactus plants hold moisture.
Some trees and shrubs grow out of solid rock. They grow up high where the wind blows strong. The wind can blow seeds into small cracks in the rock. Then the seeds start to grow. Their roots reach down into small cracks for moisture. As the roots grow, they split the rock.
Some plants have animals living inside them. Ant colonies live inside ant plants. The ants protect the plant from animals that would eat it. They use spaces in the plant’s stem as houses. Some spaces are used for raising young ants. Other spaces are used for garbage. The ant plant uses some of this garbage for food.

" whale dives, its heart slows down. This means it uses up less oxygen. Some whales can stay under water for a little less than an hour. Other whales can stay under for over an hour. Deep-diving sperm whales can stay under for up to 80 minutes.
Whales usually swim in groups called pods. A pod consists of male and female whales of many different ages. The young whales swim with their mothers. Some pods are smaller and consist only of. family members. Others are large and can have over 100 members.
Many whales migrate to warm tropical waters in the winter. They go there to have their babies. In the summer they migrate. to polar regions. They go to polar waters because of the rich. source of food found there.
Whales often seem to cooperate. with each other. One type of cooperation is bubble. feeding. When whales. bubble feed, they form. a circle. They release. bubbles from their. blowholes. The bubbles. make a curtain that traps. small fish. Each whale takes. a turn eating fish inside the curtain.
For years, whales were hunted for their meat and blubber. The blubber was used for lamp oil. It was also used to make. paint, soap, and cosmetics. As ways of hunting improved, more and more whales were killed. Many types of whales were hunted. to near extinction.
Pollution of the oceans is also threatening whales. Whales eat. fish that have toxic chemicals in their bodies. As whales eat. more and more of these fish, they become poisoned. Scientists also think that noise pollution is interfering with long-distance whale communication.
Efforts have been made to protect whales. As a result, some types of whales are increasing in number. But whales reproduce slowly. So it. will take hundreds of years to get whale populations back to safe levels.",538.0

“Then the hungry, angry Bears marched noisily up the stairs. “Someone’s been sleeping in my bed,” growled Papa Bear in a huge growl. “Someone’s been sleeping in my bed,” growled Mama Bear in a medium growl. “Someone’s been sleeping in my bed,” growled Teeny Baby Bear in a teeny growl. “And she’s still there!” “Shhhh! I’m trying to sleep!” whined Goldilocks.
Help!
When she saw three hungry, angry Bears staring at her, she leapt out of bed. “Help!” she screamed, running down the stairs, past the chairs, past the bowls of porridge, and out the door. Goldilocks never again went to the home of the three Bears. But she did often daydream about that delicious bowl of porridge, and that perfect little rocking chair, and that comfy, cozy bed. They really were just right.",589.0
" Landon pulled stubborn weeds and watered his thirsty plants. As the temperature crept higher, pumpkin vines stretched over the ground like a carpet of ivy. Landon happily wiped the sweat from his face when he realized that no room remained for more weeds to grow. Soon bright yellow flowers appeared, and then small green balls grew in their place. The vines sprawled onto the lawn and into Dad’s part of the garden.
The green balls grew bigger and bigger. By Halloween, Landon had a dozen bright orange pumpkins. He sold six to the neighbors, gave Chad three, and saved three for himself.
Landon cut the tops off his three pumpkins and scooped out the insides. Yuck, he thought, this looks like good stuff for the compost drum for next year’s garden. Then he noticed that the seeds looked just like the ones he had planted in the spring. I can recycle these to grow pumpkins next year, he thought, and I won’t have to buy new ones. Landon spread the seeds on paper to dry. But there were many more seeds than he wanted to plant.
“Dad, do you know of anything I can do with a hundred pumpkin seeds?” Landon asked. “Well, when I was a boy, we used to roast them in the oven and eat them,” Dad said. “They tasted pretty good.” “Hey, Dad, good idea. I can reuse them as a snack.” “Who would have thought I could use the three R’s—reduce, reuse, and recycle—to grow pumpkins?” he said.
Landon drew faces on his pumpkins. Then he followed the lines with his carving knife. Each pumpkin looked better than the one before! On Halloween night, Landon was proud of the six scary jack-o’-lanterns that glowed on the front porch!",691.0
" Fire trucks aren’t the only things in the garage. There’s exercise equipment, and I ask what it’s for. “We like to stay fit,’’ my uncle says. “It takes a lot of work to carry someone out of a burning house.’’ If there’s ever a fire at home, Uncle Jason warns me never to hide under my bed or behind my curtains because that would make it hard for firefighters to find me.
Suddenly, there’s a call—it’s a fire! The firefighters grab their gear and they’re off, with their sirens blaring. I stay at the station with my dad while they fight the fire. When they return, exhausted and dirty, Uncle Jason tells me all about the call. A man was working on his car in his garage when a fire started. He and his wife and daughter escaped to the sidewalk, but Fluffy, their poodle, was stuck inside.
The firefighters pulled out their hoses and went to work. Uncle Jason searched the house and found Fluffy hiding under a bed. He also found a fishbowl and two parakeets in a cage. Uncle Jason and the other firefighters saved the day! They rescued the pets and put out the fire. The car was destroyed, but the rest of the house was okay. Back at the fire station, the firefighters stow away their gear. The trucks are ready for another call.
Uncle Jason says the toughest part about being a firefighter is being away from his wife and four-year-old son. He misses them when he’s working, but he loves helping people as a firefighter. It’s time for me to go home for dinner, and the firefighters start cooking their dinner, too. They’re like one big family!",713.0

“Right,” Grandpa instructed. Devon dipped his paddle in on the right side of the canoe, and they glided on past the log. “We’re almost there,” Grandpa said as they rounded a bend. “When we get close to the bank, Devon, I want you to jump out, and I’ll throw you the rope to pull the canoe up on “Okay,” Devon said. Grandpa steered the canoe toward the shore. “This is the best catfish hole on the river,” he said.
“Scree, scree!” cried the eagle from the top of a willow tree. “So you followed us, huh, eagle?” Grandpa called. “Well, you’re welcome to join us, but you have to catch your own fish.” Devon laughed, watching the land draw closer as green whirlpools swirled past the canoe’s bow. Grandpa aimed the canoe straight for a big log—a log that looked like the perfect hiding place for a big snake. Was that where Grandpa wanted Devon to jump out?
Devon swallowed hard. “Um, Grandpa?” he asked. “Yes, Devon?” “Did a big snake really grab a catfish right off your hook?” Grandpa stopped paddling. “Who told you that story?” “Clay,” Devon answered.
“Well, you don’t have to worry about that old snake,” said Grandpa. “Whew!” Devon whistled. “No sir,” Grandpa went on, “that old snake is long gone.” Devon jumped out of the canoe, Grandpa threw him the rope, and Devon tugged the boat onto the riverbank.
“How do you know the snake is gone?” Devon asked, helping Grandpa onto the land. “I saw it with my own eyes,” Grandpa said. “The ‘gators got him.” Devon froze for a moment, staring at the green water all around them. But then Grandpa winked. “Grandpa!” cried Devon. “Scree, scree!” cried the eagle. Grandpa handed Devon his fishing pole. “Let’s catch ourselves a big catfish.”",579.0
" “Just stay out of the way,” he threatened.
I didn’t stay out of the way—I got in the way in a big way. The first time the other team started down the court, I slipped in there fast and stripped the ball away. Just like that I was dribbling the other way. Louis was running behind me shouting, “Shoot it! Shoot it!” There was a guard in front of me, his big arms spread out like an octopus. I planted my foot and started up, but I didn’t shoot—instead I passed that ball just as hard as I could to Louis.
He didn’t expect it. The ball hit him right in the gut, and his eyes bulged out in surprise and pain. But I’ve got to give it to Louis, at least he had the sense to shoot it—swish, all net. The rest of the game went like that—I got the ball, I raced down the court, and I passed off to Louis. We won! Because of me, we won!
After the game, I told my dad what had happened. He was just about as proud as could be. “Hey,” he said when we pulled up to the house, “how come you never shot the ball?” “ Well,” I said, “I practiced running, and I really am speedier than a meteor. I practiced dribbling, and there is nobody who can dribble better than I can. But I never practiced shooting, and I’m still rotten at that!” My dad laughed all the way into the house. It’s still one of his favorite family stories to tell. Basketball season is over, and all I do every day is run, dribble, and shoot. Without practice nothing gets perfect—just ask the real Shaq about his free throw shooting. He’s really rotten—maybe he ought to practice, too.",609.0

Daron’s eyes opened wide, his jaw nearly fell to the front steps. “Our camera? Thanks! Where did you find it?” “I found it in Elm Creek Park, by a park bench,” Michael replied. “I remember now,” said Daron’s mom, “we took a break from walking the dog and sat on a bench for a while. We must have forgotten to take the camera with us when we started walking again.” Daron unzipped the bag, pulled out the camera and turned it around, looking for something. “We don’t have our name on this. How did you know it was ours?”
“I discovered that you and I have something in common,” said Michael. Daron gave Michael a puzzled look—he couldn’t imagine having anything in common with this tall boy. Michael explained, “I printed the pictures in the camera hoping one of them would give me a clue about the people who owned the camera. I saw the one showing you in your classroom with your ant sculpture. And guess what?” Daron shrugged his shoulders. “We had the same third-grade teacher. I’m in tenth grade now, but I remember doing the same project in third grade. Mr. Casey always has his students make sculptures out of recycled stuff.” “Really?” Daron asked.
“But yours was better than mine. I made a dog, but the nose was so long everyone thought it was an anteater,” Michael laughed. He pulled the photographs out of his backpack and handed them to Daron. “I took the pictures to school and showed them to the secretary. She recognized you and called your mom to give her my telephone number. Then your mom called me.” “Now I can show the ant to Dad,” said Daron happily. “Thanks, Michael.

" Mike’s parents bought both kids the regular two-hour pass. Mike upgraded to the all-you-can-stand pop-and-popcorn package. After that, he had eighteen dollars left. And so it continued for the next three weeks until the original twenty-five dollars was all gone.
By that time, Derek had grown tired of his spy kit. He offered to sell it to Mike. “I haven’t got any money,” Mike said. “What about that twenty-five dollars you got for your birthday?” Derek asked. Mike hung his head. “It’s all gone,” he said. “Huh,” Derek said.
After that, Mike felt pretty down in the dumps. He moped around the house for days. Then one afternoon, Aster came home with Mike’s favorite candy bar, jumbo size. She unwrapped it in front of him.
Now, Mike knew all about sisters. He’d heard stories—heck, he’d seen his friends’ sisters in action. When most sisters sat down in front of you and unwrapped a jumbo-sized candy bar of your favorite variety , they weren’t sharing. They were practicing a kind of mental torture . Aster wasn’t like other sisters, though. She unwrapped the jumbo bar and broke off a jumbo chunk, which she handed over to Mike.“Thought this might cheer you up,” she said.“What about your compound interest?” Mike asked, his mouth already full of candy bar—delicious candy bar.
“This is tooth fairy money,” Aster said. “I like to save my savings.” “I wish I could like doing that,” Mike said. “At this rate, I’ll never get that spy kit.” Aster shrugged. “Maybe saving’s not your thing,” she said. “Just figure out another way to buy your spy kit.” Saving’s not my thing , Mike thought. Maybe I’ve got another thing. I’ve got to find my other thing. I’m gonna find my thing! He felt better already.",561.0

Then Zara heard a strange sound coming from the tree. Zara followed the sound. Her parents followed Zara. The sound seemed frantic. Zara’s heart thudded in her chest as she pushed through the branches of the tree. What if Piper is hurt? she thought. It seemed to come from underneath a big, leafy branch. Zara heaved it aside, revealing Piper huddled beneath it. Zara grabbed her sister and hugged her tight. She felt as though an enormous boulder had rolled off her chest and she could breathe again. “Why did you crawl under the tree?” Zara asked. ”Look!” Piper exclaimed, pointing to a tiny, yipping black-and-white puppy. One of the puppy’s back legs was pinned beneath the branch. Mom and Dad were able to lift it free. Zara cradled the puppy snugly in her arms to keep it warm.
Finally, they arrived at Grandma and Grandpa’s house. Walking into the house felt to Zara like rubbing her face in Tucker’s warm fur. Grandma and Grandpa were so happy to see them that they pulled everyone into an enormous group hug—even though they were soaking wet. The delicious scents of Thanksgiving dinner filled the air. Zara hadn’t realized how hungry she was. “What perfect timing,” Grandma remarked as Zara and Piper settled the puppy down by the fireplace. “Your grandfather and I have been thinking about adopting a dog from the pound.”
“Speaking of dogs,” Dad added, holding up his cell phone, “we just heard from an employee at the kennel. She sent us a text message with a video of Tucker. Look how cute he is, playing tug-of-war with his new doggie friends!” Zara smiled and sighed happily. Everyone was safe and sound.

The Corn Palace is decorated with grasses and corn of different colors. The Corn Palace is also the world’s largest bird feeder. When winter begins, the birds and squirrels eat the art!
Do you have an extra toilet seat? Bring it to Barney Smith’s Toilet Seat Art Museum. Barney Smith has made more than one thousand toilet seats into works of art.
The world’s largest elephant is a six- story building you can climb inside!
A hundred years ago, a bug called plants in Alabama. Farmers had to grow different plants. In the end, that helped the farmers. So they built a monument to the weevil.
The Sign Post Forest isn’t made of trees. It’s made of more than 100,000 signs.

Many kinds of animals live in Yellowstone. The biggest animals in Yellowstone are bison. They can weigh up to 2,000 pounds (907 kg). Bison are hairy animals with a hump on their back. They roll in the dust to fight off flies and to get rid of their old fur.
The next-biggest animals are grizzly bears. They can weigh 800 pounds (363 kg) and are fast for their size. In the winter, grizzly bears sleep in dens under the ground for months.
People forced wolves out of Yellowstone over one hundred years ago. Later, workers for the national park brought them back. About one hundred wolves live in Yellowstone today.
More than 350 other kinds of wild animals also live in the park. People may see elk, deer, golden eagles, fish, beavers, and foxes. Yellowstone is a safe place for them.
Native Americans were the first people to visit Yellowstone. They visited the area for thousands of years before it became a national park.
Later, explorers went to Yellowstone. The United States decided that the land, water, and animals were special. Yellowstone was set aside to be protected forever. The first national park was born.
There are now over fifty national parks in the United States. Some protect special natural areas. Others protect places that are important to history.
About three million people come from all over to visit Yellowstone every year. They fish, hike, camp, watch wildlife, and visit the hot springs. In Yellowstone, people can see natural beauty unlike anything else.
Now that Yellowstone is protected as a national park, it will always be around.",633.0
" The walls are well built. In some places, huge rocks form part of the walls. The walls of Great Zimbabwe are curved instead of straight.
The city has three main parts. The first is the Hill Complex, a large stone building on a hillside. This is the oldest area of the city. The kings of Great Zimbabwe may have lived here.
In the valley below, many smaller houses form the Valley Ruins. The houses were made of a mixture of clay and small rocks called daga. The people of the city lived in these houses. Across the valley is the Great Enclosure. Inside is a tall building in the shape of an oval. It is the largest ancient building in southern Africa and may have been a palace.
Great Zimbabwe was rich and powerful hundreds of years ago. The people raised crops and cattle. They also traded with other people from West Africa and the Middle East. They even traded with China, which is very far away from Great Zimbabwe.
However, after doing well for hundreds of years, the people left their city. They may have gone to find better farmland or better trade. Nobody knows for sure.
Scientists still have many questions about the ruins of Great Zimbabwe. For example, they do not know the purpose of some of its buildings. They also do not know why the people built the tall stone walls. Finally, there is the question of why the people left the city.
The ruins of Great Zimbabwe have been damaged. People have stolen from the site Wind, rain, and plants have caused problems. Laws protect the ruins, but more money and workers are needed to take care of the site. If the ruins are preserved, perhaps someday scientists can solve the mysteries of Great Zimbabwe.",703.0
" Most people believed chimps weren’t smart enough to use simple tools. Jane saw David use a stick to poke into a termite hill to reach a termite snack. That was smart! Jane reported that David used the stick as a tool to get food. Her words upset many scientists because they thought only people could make or use tools.
Other chimps also began to trust Jane and let her watch them. She reported chimp behavior that no one else had ever seen before.
Jane said that each chimp behaved in its own way, just as humans do. She saw chimps being happy, sad, angry, and loving—just as humans are. Jane’s reports surprised many people. Her work made many scientists think that their old ideas about the species might be wrong.
After living in Gombe for many years, Jane began to worry. She saw that many of the forests were being cut down. The chimps were losing their homes. Some people were even hunting the chimps for food. Hunters were also stealing baby chimps to sell them. Some older chimps were sold to labs for experiments.
Jane was afraid that the Gombe chimps might all die. She knew she had to tell people what was happening in the Gombe Forest. Jane began to travel and talk with large groups of people. She asked them to help her save the chimps and the forest. People trusted Jane and listened to her. They agreed to support her work in Gombe.
More than fifty years have passed since Jane Goodall first went to Tanzania. Today, she still meets with people all over the world. She still talks about her work there. When she can, she returns to her Gombe home. She walks into the forest and sits down quietly. She smiles as she watches the chimps.",623.0
" Spines look and feel like thorns, but they are different.
A cactus spine is actually a special kind of leaf. Cactus plants usually live in hot deserts. Regular leaves may dry out in the hot sun, but sunlight and heat bounce off spines.
Stinging plants have hairs that can poke animals that are trying to eat them. Inside each hair is a small tube with stinging fluid. The tip of this tube breaks easily.
When an animal bumps the hair, the tip breaks off and shoots fluid into the animal. Each leaf of a nettle plant has hundreds of stinging hairs.
Some plants make poison to protect themselves. Eating one of these plants can cause an animal to get sick or even die. Deadly nightshade makes a powerful poison. This poison is found in all parts of the plant. Eating just one leaf can kill a large animal.
Some plants hide from animals by blending in with the ground where they grow. The living stone plant grows in dry, rocky ground among pebbles and stones. This plant looks like just another small stone. Animals do not see it as something to eat.
When an animal bumps a touch-me-not plant, the plant folds up its leaves. The thin, folded leaves do not look as tasty as full leaves. Also, a plant that moves may scare away an insect or other animal trying to eat it.
The tobacco plant plays a trick on the pests that eat it. When an insect bites a leaf, the plant sends out a special smell. This smell invites enemies, such as the big-eyed bug, to eat the invading insect.
Plants might look defenseless at first, but they have powerful defenses to help them survive. Even without claws or horns like some animals, plants can protect themselves.",656.0

Later, Shin plays tug-of-war with friends. She laughs at the men who dress as tortoises. They dance around the village and sing for food and drink.
In Israel, Abel and Ilana have a different way of celebrating the harvest and honoring their ancestors. The celebration is called Sukkoth, and it’s held in September or October. Abel helps his father build a three-sided hut in their garden. They make the roof from corn stalks. They leave holes where they can see the sky. The family will eat their meals in the hut for the next week. Abel hopes he can sleep in it at night. Ilana comes to help decorate the hut with squash and corn.
Father explains why they build a hut. “It’s to remember our ancestors. They built huts in the fields at harvest time. They slept there so they wouldn’t have to walk so far each day.” The hut reminds them of how far their ancestors had to walk on their journey to the promised land.
There are seven days of feasting and religious services. Abel and Ilana prepare lulavs (loo-LAWVs) by cutting a palm branch, two willow branches, and three myrtle branches. Then they tie them together. The family joins other families to walk to the synagogue. They wave the lulav in their right hands and carry an etrog (es-ROG), a citrus fruit, in their left.

Other people collect things they find in nature, such as sticks or shells. They search for items to collect while hiking in the woods or exploring a beach. Many people use their collections to create new things. Some collectors turn their finds into things they can wear, such as a necklace made from collected sea glass. Others make works of art. Bottle caps are used to make anything from maps to magnets. Driftwood can be turned into wind chimes.
You Collect What?
Some people collect objects based on a specific theme, such as a type of animal. One woman set the world record for owl collectibles. She owns more than eighteen thousand things related to owls—owl toys, owl T-shirts, and more.
It takes time to build a collection. It can be rewarding to find an item that you’ve been looking for, such as a particular lunch box. Some people enjoy having to work hard to add to their collection. Other people prefer to collect things that are easy to find or make. A woman even made a museum to house her collection of burnt food.

" “Was there always a Memorial Day?” he asked Grandma.
“At first, it was called Decoration Day. You know, decoration can mean a medal or award to honor bravery in battle,” Grandma continued. They had stopped in front of a grave with a flag next to it and Kyle read the inscription. “This soldier was only nineteen years old, Grandma. That’s my cousin Ken’s age.” Kyle suddenly felt sad. His grandmother noticed his mood changed. “Yes, it can be a solemn occasion for many people,” she said.
As they walked back to the house, Grandma told him that many countries have different days set aside to honor lost soldiers. “In England, it’s called ‘Poppy Day,’” Grandma explained. “Poppies are red flowers that became a symbol for Memorial Day there.” Back at the house, Kyle used the Internet to discover more about Memorial Day. He read General John A. Logan’s Memorial Day Order, made in 1868, three years after the end of the Civil War. This was the official beginning of the Memorial Day tradition in America. It became a federal holiday in 1971.
By the morning of the parade, Kyle felt like a Memorial Day expert. “Did you know they have a Memorial Day in Australia, too?” Kyle said as he dug into the pancakes his grandmother had made for breakfast. “There, it’s called ANZAC Day. ANZAC stands for Australian and New Zealand Army Corps,” he explained.
Kyle and his grandmother had found a shady spot to watch the parade. “You can watch the parade with me, or you can ride on that old fire truck, and be in it,” his grandmother said. “Wow, thanks Grandma!” Kyle said as he ran toward the truck.

" The urine sticks to their long belly hair and makes them smell terrible.
The hoatzin (wat-SEEN) is the real name for the “stinkbird.” This bird mainly eats leaves. The food breaks down in the bird’s crop (the area under its throat) before reaching its stomach. This way of eating makes the hoatzin smell awful.
Vultures are used to bad odors. After all, their diet consists of the stinky flesh of dead animals. When an enemy is near, vultures throw up! The stuff they vomit is extra nasty. It contains rotten meat and stomach acid strong enough to cause burns.
Some bugs also use odor to stay safe. The bombardier beetle can’t fly to escape its enemies, so it has a strong weapon. It can release a hot cloud of stinky, deadly spray. It’s hot enough to kill many enemies and burn humans.
What millipedes lack in speed, they make up for in stink. Millipedes can’t move fast, so they need a different way to stay safe. If an enemy comes near, they curl up and give off a stinky liquid. Some millipedes even shoot the smelly stuff.
The common musk turtle has another name—stinkpot! It smells bad when other animals disturb it. A stinky yellow liquid comes out of the back of its body. The mink frog uses scent to keep enemies away as well. Its stink has been compared to rotten onions. It gives off this nasty smell to stay safe from other animals.
Being stinky helps many plants and animals stay alive. For plants, the odor brings insects that help them reproduce. For animals, the odor often helps keep enemies away. It can also help an animal eat food or get mates. Stinky steam, spray, vomit, slime, and urine are some of nature’s smelly ways of helping living things survive.",762.0
" Most of the kids had crowded onto the fishing pier, their fishing lines crisscrossing and getting tangled in the water.
“Look, I caught a fish already,” Miyuki yelled. “The grand prize is mine!” She jumped up and down with excitement as Chief Dugan measured the fish and then quickly released it. “It’s an impressive fish, Miyuki,” he said with a grin, “but remember, the derby isn’t over yet.”
Fishing far from the others, Luis stood quietly. SPLISH, SPLASH! What was going on? Curious, Luis looked over toward the other kids. SPLASH! Carlos had slipped and fallen into the water. SPLASH! Amelia had dropped her fishing pole. SPLASH! A crying toddler had thrown her doll into the water. SPLASH! Keenan had fallen off the log he had been perched on.
Luis ignored the uproar and focused his attention on his fishing pole. No fish yet. Luis waited quietly and patiently for a long time. Still no fish. What if his unbelievably secret plan didn’t work?
Tug, tug, tug! A huge fish bit and tugged at the worm on Luis’s fishing line. Very carefully, Luis reeled in the most enormous fish he’d ever seen.
Chief Dugan raced over and measured the sleek silver fish, and then slipped it back into the water. Over the bullhorn, he declared the Deer Lake Fishing Derby over and announced the lucky winners. For catching the biggest fish of the day, Luis won the grand prize... a new bike!
Dad was so happy. “What was your plan, Luis?” he said, flipping hamburgers on the hot grill. “Did you use a lucky worm or your special fishing lure?” Luis grinned and climbed on his shiny new bike. “I waited for the noisy kids to frighten all the fish over to me,” he said. “And they sure did. My super-secret plan worked great!”",636.0
" Then one parent leaves to get small fish to feed the chick. The other parent keeps the chick safe.
Naked mole rats live in this hole! These small animals spend all of their lives underground in the dark. Small hairs on their face and tail help them find their way. They dig tunnels to find roots and other plant parts to eat.
Naked mole rats work as a team to build their tunnels. One animal breaks new soil at the front of the line. Behind it, several others use their feet to move dirt backward. A worker at the back kicks the dirt up to the surface. Different parts of the tunnels have different uses, such as food storage or nest areas.
A Japanese giant salamander lives in this underwater hole! It lives in cool mountain rivers and streams. During the day, it hides in a burrow or under rocks. At night, it comes out to hunt for food.
In late summer, males and females come together at long burrows. Females swim into the burrows to lay their eggs—up to five hundred! A male watches the eggs to make sure no fish eat them.
A wombat lives in this hole! It digs a burrow with its huge claws. Wombats stay in their burrows during the day. At night, they come out to feed on plants. They run to their burrow if an enemy chases them. They may also protect themselves by fighting.
So far, I’ve blogged about animal holes on six continents. Are you wondering about Antarctica? I just learned that sea urchins live in burrows there. Check back soon for a post about them. I’m going to keep doing research on animals that live in holes. It’s so fun to learn about the natural world!",598.0
" “This sounds like a rainy-day emergency. I have money in my savings account, if it would help.”
Dad managed a small smile. “Thank you, Anita. But you can save that money for your own rainy-day emergency.” “I still have my job, and we have our own savings account,” Mom said. “We will cut back on expenses for a while and cancel our vacation to the beach. But because we planned ahead and saved, we’ll probably be all right until your dad finds a new job.” Anita felt better, but something told her she should plan ahead, too.
One week later, it was raining hard when Anita got home from school. But even in bad weather, she had to do her job. People and dogs were depending on her. She put her feet into galoshes that rose almost to her knees. She pulled on a shiny yellow raincoat and grabbed her umbrella. Then she trudged off to the first house.
Anita had six dogs to walk, and none of them liked getting wet. They cried and huddled together as she pulled on their leashes with one hand. With her other hand, she tried to hold on to the umbrella. But the wind whipped the umbrella around until Anita lost her grip. The umbrella flew from her hand and went crashing down the sidewalk.
By the time Anita caught up to it, the umbrella was torn and bent, and she was soaked. She sloshed around the rest of the block with the dogs, then ran for the shelter of her house. “What happened to you?” Mom asked. “I just had a rainy-day emergency,” Anita said, realizing how she wanted to spend at least some of her savings. “It’s time to buy a new umbrella!”",534.0
" When people found salt buried underground, they dug it out and used it. If there was a lot of salt and it was deep, workers would dig a mine.
People living in Germany hundreds of years ago built a salt mine inside their mountains. Men broke off large rocks of salt with strong tools. They used animals to haul it out to the villages. Giant wooden slides brought workers down into the mine and helped pull out the heavy salt rocks. Today, there is a huge salt bed beneath part of the United States and Canada. One of the biggest salt mines in the world is under the city of Detroit, Michigan. There are about fifty miles of underground roads made of salt! The salt mine is as deep as the height of a tall building.
Are You Worth Your Salt?
Salt was hard to get in most places 2,000 years ago. It was very expensive and had to be kept locked up. Salt was so special that some people were paid with salt instead of money! Today, salt is very cheap and easy to find. Many places give it away for free. You see it on the table at most restaurants.
Much of the salt used today is not used with food. Salt makes it harder for water to freeze. So we put over half the salt that comes from mines onto icy roads and sidewalks. This helps keep cars from crashing and people from slipping. Imagine a visitor from 2,000 years ago seeing a huge truck just dumping precious salt on a road! Be happy you live in a time when salt is easy to find. Your body needs salt to live—that’s crystal clear. You do not have to take that fact with a grain of salt.",667.0
" This created a bowl that trapped the sound from the stage. No matter where you sat, the sound was the same. “I can’t believe things like this could have been built so long ago,” said Brady. “Well, my friend, just wait. We still have the Acropolis to visit,” Dimitri said.
“Dimitri, I don’t know what the big deal is,” Brady said. “We’ve walked all this way to see the Acropolis, but all it looks like is a bunch of broken rocks.” “Brady, my young friend, be patient,” Dimitri said. “You need to pay more attention to the little details of life. This is an important lesson for you to learn.” Sure enough, after reaching the top, Brady’s jaw dropped open at the sight before him.
On the highest point of the Acropolis hill stood a stone temple with massive columns of marble. It was as big as a modern football stadium, and it was decorated with carved figures. The entire building seemed to glow in the late afternoon light. Brady’s thoughts spun as he pictured this temple being built by ancient people. “So, was it worth the climb?” Dimitri asked playfully. “Yes, it’s awesome,” Brady said.
As the Sun began to set, Brady thought about everything he’d seen. “You are right, Dimitri. I need to pay more attention to the details of life. I would have missed many of these sights if I had been by myself. Thank you for opening my eyes.” “You don’t need to thank me, my friend,” Dimitri answered. He put a hand on Brady’s shoulder and joined him in admiring the sunset. In the fading light, Brady thought to himself that he would leave Greece a different person than he was when he arrived.",649.0
" The different positions of the magnets create a code. Tape players, VCRs, and computers sense the tiny magnetic fields and read the code. Putting a credit card, tape, or disk near a powerful magnet can mess up or erase the code.
Some high-speed trains run on electromagnets. The trains have powerful electromagnets on the bottom. The track also has powerful electromagnets. The two electromagnets face each other so that they repel each other. The magnetic force is so strong that it lifts the train off the track. The train floats above the track. It actually flies as it travels. This makes a fast, smooth ride.
Special machines called MRIs can look inside a person’s body. The person lies inside a tube cut right down the center of a very powerful magnet. The lines of force flow through the person’s body. The magnetism is so strong that it causes the atoms in the body to spin in the same direction. Special sensitive instruments can tell how fast the atoms spin. Computers figure out what kind of atoms they are based on how they spin. This gives doctors an idea of what is going on inside a person’s body. Doctors can find atoms that are not supposed to be there. They can see cancer and other diseases. MRIs give doctors a look inside the body without having to cut the body open.
While magnets may seem simple, there is no end to their uses. Every time you watch a tape, turn on the air conditioner, or even turn on a light, you are using magnets. Someday you may ride on a high-speed train or use an MRI. Playing with magnets can be lots of fun. The magnetism you play with is the same force that has made modern life possible.",775.0
" Seals cannot “walk” on their flippers. Instead, they drag themselves along the ground or crawl like caterpillars.
The biggest pinnipeds in the world are elephant seals. Elephant seals get their name because of their huge size and long noses. Leopard seals are fierce predators. They have big mouths and sharp teeth. They often feed on birds such as penguins. They also attack other seals. Ribbon seals have black fur with white bands. Ringed seals have small, ring-shaped markings.
Walruses are the only pinnipeds with tusks. They use their tusks to show off to other walruses. They also use them to pull themselves up onto land. Some walruses hook their tusks onto floating ice. Then they relax and sleep.
Walruses have very little fur. Their thick skin and blubber keep them warm. When a walrus goes into cold water, its skin turns pale. This is because all of its blood moves to the inside of its body. When the walrus is warm, its blood moves to the surface again. The walrus turns pink. Walruses like to haul out together in big heaps.
People have always hunted pinnipeds. When humans invented large ships and guns, they could hunt and kill many more pinnipeds. Soon, many pinnipeds began dying out. Humans used their fur and skin to make clothing. They ate their meat and burned their blubber as fuel. Only the native people of the far north still hunt pinnipeds. They hunt only what they need to survive.
People around the world worried about pinnipeds. Countries began making laws against hunting them. Many pinnipeds have begun to come back. But some are still in danger. Pinnipeds become caught in fishing nets. Others get sick because of pollution. Pinnipeds have very few predators, besides humans. It is up to us to decide what their future will be.",619.0
" Left, right, left, right—the spikes on his shoes clawed into the track beneath him. Harder, harder. Kenny’s knees and elbows pumped like pistons. Every muscle strained. His feet pounded the track with so much force that it felt as if his heart would shake loose.
Now Kenny could see the tape stretched in front of him at the finish line. He felt as though he was flying. Push, push, push. Was he winning? He leaned forward. Don’t run to it, run through it. Three final strides and he felt the tape snap across his chest. He’d done it! He’d won! The other runners shook Kenny’s hand as he took some long breaths and checked the timer’s board. When his time finally went up, he let out a long sigh. It was a personal record—the best he’d ever run. It didn’t feel as good as he hoped.
Kenny changed his shoes and shirt. At the award ceremony, an official handed him his first place medal. The round gold disk felt heavy and cool in his hand. He wanted to show it to someone . . . but that someone wasn’t there. The sun was setting behind the stadium as his team packed up their gear and headed to the bus. Coach Fisher came over and shook Kenny’s hand.
“Nice race, Kenny,” the coach said. “Oh, by the way, I left our team bag up in our section on the bleachers. Would you go grab it?” Coach Fisher pointed up to the last bag. Kenny climbed the bleachers to collect it. Then he stopped.

I thought I had killed her or something. I laid her down on the ledge and ran my finger down her fish tail. Right then she looked more like a toy doll than a real mermaid. I felt really bad, thinking maybe I had killed her, but then she opened her eyes. She looked up at me and blinked a couple of times. She looked over toward the water and then back at me. Then she closed her eyes and went stiff again. I wondered what was going on.
In the distance, I could hear Sarah and Sybil calling my name. “I’m up here!” I shouted excitedly. “I’m coming down. Wait until you see what I found.” With the mermaid gripped tightly in my hand, I climbed down from the rock. I was so excited. It’s not every day you find a three-inch mermaid. This is where the trouble started with Sybil and Sarah.
I showed them what I had found, but the mermaid wouldn’t wake up. The two tellers of untruth laughed at me. They said the mermaid was nothing more than a silly doll. Then they grabbed their backpacks and ran laughing back to my house. Since then, they have told everyone that I carried one of my “dollies” on the picnic. They said that when they caught me playing with it, I made up the story about the mermaid.
And there it is—my proof. Now you’ve read it, too! But now what do I do? I’ve got a mermaid in a teacup, but every time I show her to someone, she gets stiff like a doll.

" But he’s going to help you. You’ll look like his slaves. No one will suspect you when he leads you across the bridge.”
We met the white man, Mr. Avery, just before dawn. Emmy wished us luck before she headed south again to find more slaves and lead them to freedom. Mr. Avery took most of our clothes and packed them in a trunk. He put us in shackles. Daddy looked scared. I suddenly wondered if this was all a trick for Mr. Avery to capture runaway slaves. I started to cry. I hated those chains. All I could think about was how Momma’s hands and feet would have been in them as they led her away.
“We have to trust him,” Daddy said. But his voice didn’t sound so sure. Mr. Avery led us through the streets. The white people ignored us. The black people glanced quickly at us and then looked away. Mr. Avery led us onto the bridge. I was crying, because I was still so afraid that he would turn us around and sell us again. But then I felt my feet touch the soft soil on the Ohio side of the river. Somehow, my tired feet could tell that I was free. Even though I was still in the shackles, I felt the weight of them disappear. “We did it, Daniel,” Daddy said with a shaky voice. “Someday we’ll go back for her.”
It was too dark outside when I nudged her. “No,” Momma groaned, and waved her hand at me. “Shh, now,” I said. Finally, she opened her eyes, and I could see them shining in the dark. “Daniel?” she whispered. “It’s time to go,” I said. “I’m here to lead you. We’re running!”",534.0
" “This is where we found the key,” I say, pulling it out of my pocket. “Put it in there,” Thomas says, pointing to the trickle of water. “Where?” I ask. Thomas continues to point. I can’t see anything in the rock, so I start feeling around. The freezing water runs down my arm, and I shiver. Then I feel it—a small hole, just about the right size for a key. I hesitate a moment and then stick it in and turn it. We hear a slight click followed by rumbling, and then the sound of water filling something up.
“Look!” Sarah says. The stone around the keyhole begins to crumble and fall away like clods of dirt. The water seems to spread itself out, washing away more and more stone. Underneath, an ornately carved door appears. We stare at it a long time. “Are you going through?” Thomas asks. The other kids echo him. “What’s on the other side?” I ask. “We don’t know,” Thomas replies. Sarah and I look at each other. We know we could go home right now, and everything would be as it was before. We could have normal, happy lives—but somewhere, deep down, we’d always wonder—what’s behind the door? Could we have found her mother and my uncle? Could we have brought our families back together?
“I think...” I begin, but don’t have a chance to finish. Jake walks up to the door, grabs the knob, and says, “I wonder where this goes.” As he opens the door, the cave fills with yellow light, and by the time our eyes adjust, he and Odie are gone. I shake my head, exasperated. The choice has been made. Sarah and I hold hands as we step into the doorway and begin to fall.",563.0

While students earn belts, they learn many good habits, such as self-control and patience. They can use these skills in other areas of their lives. The good habits students learn are just as important as the moves they practice.
Students earn new colored belts in a certain order. One story tells the meaning of each color through the growth of a plant. The different colors of the belts stand for the colors of the Sun, plant, and sky. A student grows much like a young plant. They grow as time passes and gain more skills.
Students learn karate in three main steps: kihon, kata, and kumite.
Kihon is the set of moves for beginners. In kihon, students learn to breathe correctly and stand in the right position. They also learn how to do kicks, punches, blocks, and other moves. It is important for them to learn patience. Students practice until they are perfect.
Kata is putting the moves from kihon into a routine. Students pretend to fight off attackers and learn to defend themselves. They also practice their flow from one move to the next. There are many different katas to learn.
Many students also practice bunkai while learning kata. In bunkai, students learn why the moves from kata are useful. They learn to slow down and think about each move before they do it.
After a lot of hard work, karate students reach the last step. In kumite, they use everything they have learned by practicing moves on one another.
For many years, people around the world have learned good habits through karate. They have also worked hard to become stronger and faster, and to earn new belts. Some students hope to become karate masters, and everyone has a lot of fun trying to get there.",739.0

But how much is a billion?
Imagine I gave you a million dollars every day. At that rate, it would take almost two years and nine months before you had one billion dollars.
How long do you think it would take to count to a billion during a game of hide and seek? If you counted that high, your game would last about one hundred years! And that’s if you didn’t stop to sleep, eat, drink, or do anything else while you counted.
Remember the jar of one thousand pennies? Imagine stacking one billion pennies up in the shape of a block. The block would be about the size of five school buses.
How Much Is a Trillion?
A billion is a big number, but a trillion is much larger. One thousand times larger to be exact. We write one trillion as a one followed by twelve zeros, like this: 1,000,000,000,000. But what does a trillion look like? Imagine that you stacked up one trillion pennies in the shape of a cube. Each side of the cube would be almost as long as a football field.
People who work in science, business, and government often use big numbers in their work. A scientist might use big numbers to measure the distance from Earth to the Sun. A businessperson might use them to count how many products a company has sold. A city planner might use them to decide how many schools a city with millions of people needs.

A cold wind blew. The leaves fell from the trees. The earth froze, and grains, fruits, and flowers all died. Months passed, but the dark winter remained as Demeter grieved . Zeus, the king of the gods, pleaded with Demeter. He asked her to bring back the sunlight and let the plants grow again. Demeter only cared about her daughter.
So, Zeus ordered Hades to return Persephone to the world above. Hades obeyed, but he begged Persephone to eat something before she left his world forever. Nothing tempted her but a small plate of pomegranate seeds. They seemed to glow as bright and red as tiny suns. Persephone tried one juicy seed. It was so delicious. She ate three more.
Hades smiled and waved as Persephone left him. He had tricked her, but she didn’t yet know it. No one had ever told her that the living should never eat food in the underworld.
When Demeter and Persephone finally met again, they flung their arms around each other. Hand in hand, they walked through the barren winter fields. With each step, the grass turned greener and the air warmer. Spring had returned.
“You didn’t eat anything in the underworld, did you?” Demeter asked her daughter. “Nothing but four little seeds,” Persephone said. Demeter burst into tears. Persephone’s fate was sealed.

It was a big job. Twenty thousand workers helped build the Taj Mahal. One thousand elephants helped carry things. Builders and painters came from all over the world. Huge pieces of white marble were pulled on carts by oxen. Workers used ropes to move the marble into place. The work was finished in 1653.

Next, the hungry bears walked into the living room and saw their chairs. “Someone’s been sitting in my chair,” growled Papa Bear in a huge bear growl. “Someone’s been sitting in my chair,” growled Mama Bear in a medium bear growl. “Someone’s been sitting in my chair,” growled Teeny Baby Bear in a teeny bear growl. “And it’s broken in hundreds of pieces!”
Then the hungry, angry bears marched noisily up the stairs. “Someone’s been sleeping in my bed,” growled Papa Bear in a huge growl. “Someone’s been sleeping in my bed,” growled Mama Bear in a medium growl. “Someone’s been sleeping in my bed,” growled Teeny Baby Bear in a teeny growl. “And she’s still there!” “Shhhh! I’m trying to sleep!” whined Goldilocks.
Help!
When she saw three hungry, angry bears staring at her, she leapt out of bed. “Help!” she screamed, running down the stairs, past the chairs, past the bowls of porridge, and out the door. Goldilocks never again went to the home of the three bears. But she did often daydream about that delicious bowl of porridge, and that perfect little wooden chair, and that comfy, cozy bed.

" “Who knows what magic is in them?” he thought. So he made a tiny pair of red shoes just like the fairy shoes. He covered the real shoes with black polish, so they couldn’t be recognized. Then at sunrise he went back to the Path. Just as before, the fairy man appeared at the edge of the ditch.
Chapter 6
“Top of the morning to you,” said the shoemaker. “Here are your shoes.” He handed the fairy man the pair he had made. The little man looked at them, but he said nothing, and he did not put them on. “Have you looked at the things I gave you last night?” said the little man. “Oh, no. I came here as soon as I woke up,” lied the shoemaker.
“Be sure to look when you get back,” said the little man. And then the shoemaker grinned. He was sure that the fairy man had just uttered the magic words that would turn the pebbles back into jewels. “Ah, sir,” said the fairy man, “I believe there’s a bit of dust on your shoes. Let me polish them for you.”
“That means I’ll be home in an instant,” thought the shoemaker. But the little man breathed on his shoes and muttered some words the shoemaker couldn’t hear. Soon, the shoemaker’s feet began to tingle. Then they itched, and then they burned. Finally, he began to dance, and he danced all around the Path. The fairy man laughed and laughed, holding his sides. The shoemaker danced until he cried out from exhaustion, but the fairies drove him away. Where he went, nobody knows, but some say they’ve seen the greedy shoemaker dancing from sunset to sunrise around Murdoch’s Path.",584.0
" “Turtles,” I shouted. “No,” she laughed, “crabs. But that’s a good thing in a bad way.” She flipped on her flashlight and drew the light across the beach. There, scuttling across the sand against the fluorescent foam from the surf were hundreds of crabs.
“Crabs? What’s that got to do with the turtles?” As we watched she explained that the crabs prey on the turtles. “It’s a good thing,” she said, “because it means the turtles are hatching. It’s a bad thing because they will kill a lot of them.” I grabbed a big stick and said, “Then I’ll just kill some crabs.” “No,” she said gently, “the crabs are a part of nature. The turtles that survive will be the strongest. That is the way of nature. The weak die so that the species will be stronger.”
In thirty minutes or so, they came. Starting like a trickle, then like a bigger wave, the little turtles began digging from the sandy nests and scurrying down to the surf. The crabs caught some of them, but many more made their way to the water.
All in all that was the most amazing night of my life, some fifteen years ago. I long since have gotten rid of my sensitivity to being called Turtle Tom, and now as a marine biologist I am flattered when school kids who come to the marina call me that.
Who was the Turtle Lady? Her real name was Ila Loetscher, and she loved and protected the turtles like nobody else in Texas. She died at the age of 95.
I often walk the beaches at Port Aransas. She is still there in spirit, guarding the sea turtles. By the way, all my friends call me Turtle Tom.",614.0

They fairly flew down the next section. They were moving so fast, the air seemed to be sucked right out of their lungs. They had ridden through several of the early turns when Sam raced past Jessie and then tipped an edge. He spun a ragged 360 and nearly dropped, almost bitten. Again, they stopped. They were all breathing hard, openly frightened. If it was possible, the Snake was even steeper in this section. Without saying a word, they climbed to the top of the ditch only to be confronted by Cliff.
When Cliff was mad like this, he liked to hit something. The only something in reach was Isaac. Roaring profanities, Cliff swung his fist. Isaac had two choices—to get on his board and ride, or to let Cliff have some punching practice. There was really no choice. With wheels roaring on the rough concrete surface, the four of them blasted down the hill. They flew into the final curve and through a crowd that had gathered at the edge of Lizard Ditch. The last three hundred feet of concrete was all sparks and dust as they each dug in their edges and ground to a stop.
They stood there looking dazed and trying to catch their breath. Up the hill, kids from their school were running toward them, whooping and shouting. The four looked at each other and then laughed. There was really nothing to say. They had done what few had done before. They had wheeled the Snake, and not one of them had been bitten. Skateboarders and rollerbladers all over the county still talk about that ride. It’s what legends are made of. It’s what makes wheeling the Snake as cool as it is. Few have tried, and fewer have earned the coiled snake patch.",620.0
" It affects a lot of the world’s weather. It is home to many unique animals. And of course, it is home to special people.
The Yanomami culture is probably different from yours. Chances are that you don’t go to school with red stripes painted on your body. And you probably don’t wear sticks in your nose. But after reading about the Yanomami, they might seem a little less strange to you.
Just as you put on a shirt, the Yanomami paint red stripes on their chests. Just as you go to school in the morning, they walk into the rainforest to find food. And just as you have learned from your parents, the Yanomami learn from their parents. So in some ways, you are not that different after all.
Did you find the stories of the Yanomami interesting? Would you like to read more about them?
Let’s Investigate!
The Yanomami know where their food, clothes, and houses come from.
Do you? Do you know where your clothes were made? What about the very shirt on your back? Well, a person on the other side of the world may have helped to make it!
There’s a pretty easy way to find out where things come from: read the label. There are labels on shirts, fruit, canned food, toys, and many more things. Labels might read: “Made in Spain” or “Made in China” or “Made in Brazil.” See where the things in your house were made. If there’s not a label, maybe it was made nearby. Ask somebody!
If you start to find things from all over the world, it might be fun to photocopy a world map. Then you could draw an “X” (or put a sticker) on each country where things are from. Then you would see how global your life really is.",603.0

Sensing hot and cold is important for many animals. Some bats and snakes have special heat sensors that can help them find prey. A rattlesnake can “feel” the heat of a mouse’s body from over a foot away.
Scientists think humans have the best sense of time, but there’s a chance that other animals sense it, too. For example, dogs and cats sometimes seem to sense when it’s time for their owners to come home.
Using Sounds to “See”
Some animals use sounds to “see” the things around them, even deep underwater or in the dark. By making sounds and listening to echoes, these animals can tell where things are. Some bats, dolphins, whales, and birds have this special sense.
Did you know that nature has more colors than the human eye can see? Some birds and insects can see those extra colors. Seeing extra colors helps these animals find food or attract mates.
Whiskers on animals aren’t just cute. Whiskers help animals to sense movement in the air or water around them. Whiskers can also help animals squeeze through small spaces or catch other animals with their mouths.
Every animal’s body gives off a weak electric field. Humans and most other animals can’t sense these fields, but some animals that live in water can. Some sharks can find fish hiding in the sand on the ocean floor just by using this sense.
The needle in a compass always points north because of Earth’s magnetic field. Some animals have a kind of natural compass built into their bodies. These animals can always “feel” which way is north, so they can travel long distances without getting lost.
There are many senses beyond hearing, sight, smell, touch, and taste. As you explore the world, think about the extra senses that animals, including you, use every day.",766.0

“Oh, it’s... wonderful. The best I’ve seen,” Darryl said. It was an impressive salad—but it was only a salad. He didn’t want to be rude, though. Maybe he and his mom could get some real food afterward. Then they could laugh about their “Guinea Pig Thanksgiving.”
“I’m glad you like it,” Jessica said. “We usually play board games until dinner is ready. Want to play?” “Sure,” Darryl said, confused. It looked to him as though dinner was ready.
Playing board games with everyone was a blast, and Darryl met some cool people. Most of the guests weren’t vegetarians, either. “I’ve never had a better dinner than I’ve had in this house,” said one. “This family should open a restaurant,” said another. Darryl figured they were being polite because Jessica’s family was right there. Either that, or they really liked salad.
Finally, Jessica’s mom said it was time to eat, and everyone filed into the colorful dining room. The room had changed. Every surface was filled with plates, bowls, and dishes of food. Darryl didn’t know the names of half of them.
Everyone broke through the chain, sat down, and started passing the food around. There were mashed potatoes, cranberry sauce, bean and cheese tamales, and vegetarian chili. Someone had brought a small vegetarian turkey that jiggled on the table (and tasted nothing like turkey). Darryl tried some sweet potatoes and yams, which he learned are two different plants. He also learned that stuffing made without a turkey is called dressing. He even had some of Jessica’s salad and told her he loved it—because he did.
After the desserts, his mom leaned over and whispered, “I told you that you’d be surprised.” Darryl opened his mouth to talk but then leaned back in his chair with a sigh. “I’m too full to argue,” he said.",651.0
" “It has been very hard. But I have learned a lot,” said Father. “In this new land, I am not only a planter as I was in England, but also a builder, a hunter, and at times a cook.”
Sarah looked around her. Her new home looked a little like England, but it smelled different. Some of the trees looked the same, and there were rocks along the coast. Sarah’s new house was much smaller than their house in England. There was no glass in Plymouth, so the windows were made of waxed paper. In England, her home was made of stone, and here it was made of tree trunks and bark! Luckily, she had brought her own blanket from England, and it comforted her.
The next day, Sarah helped her mother cook and sew, just as she had back in England. But they had to be very careful not to lose any of the small sewing needles because there was a limited supply. Her father and older brothers helped another new family build a house. With so many people of all ages helping, they were done in a couple of days. Soon her father was back in the fields, tending to the corn, beans, and squash.
Sarah’s brothers helped gather wood from the forest for the fire. They never had to do that in England. “When will we go to school as we did in England, Father?” asked Sarah. “First, we must make sure that everyone in Plymouth has a home and food to eat. Until then, your mother will teach you.” Sarah liked that. She thought that even though things were more different than alike between Plymouth and England, she was going to like living here.",584.0

" When she needed more yarn, she gathered more burning nettles and hastened back to the castle. Each day at dusk, the brothers would return to visit their sister. The next day when the Sun rose, her brothers would again become wild swans and fly away. But one morning the queen spied eleven swans flying from Eliza’s window and grew worried.
The next morning, she crept to Eliza’s room. Just at dawn, before the swans could fly away, she threw a giant net over them. She had men haul the swans to a dark, dreary cell deep in the castle’s dungeon. When the Sun set that day, no one could hear their human cries. Eliza found them, though, and continued to knit through the dark nights outside their cell door.
Then the queen announced that there would be a marvelous and giant feast: roast bird for everyone in the castle. Only Eliza knew the truth about the feast, and she could not speak it. Instead, she continued her task, knowing she must finish quickly or all her work would be in vain.
The morning of the feast, her fingers still knit the green yarn. Ten shirts lay in a pile at her feet outside her brothers’ prison cell. She was working hard on the eleventh shirt when the men came to haul the swans away. As the queen unlocked the cell door, Eliza threw the eleven shirts over the swans.
They turned into eleven handsome princes. The youngest brother’s shirt was not quite finished, however. He was left with a swan’s wing instead of an arm.

But other than that, Fred was gone.
Mom was very upset. I tried to tell her that Fred had been talking about traveling with the ducks. Maybe he slipped out, met up with a big old group of wild ducks, and headed south. I told her he would probably come back in the spring. I’ll bet that’s what happened.
Nothing was going to get me off the hook because Mom was really mad. She gave me the “responsibility” talk. I cried like I always do. I am grounded for today, but Sarah and Sybil still got to come over. I wish they hadn’t.
I told them all about the talking parakeet. I told them he even wanted to play cards, and he loved Britney Spears. I am so mad at Sarah and Sybil. They said I’d made everything up about Fred. They said the parakeet was probably in heaven. They even said they thought the cat ate him. They are liars and fibbers and tellers of untruth. My diary proves it! I hate them.
Mom felt bad about what happened and said I could go to the movies with Sarah and Sybil tomorrow. I called Davey Brewster to see if he could go, too. He said he had to go to church. We’re going to the matinee. It’s going to be a lot of fun.

For a long time, Helen didn’t understand the finger game Anne played with her. But Anne did not give up. One day at the water pump, which is sort of like a water fountain, Anne pumped water over one of Helen’s hands. She used her fingers to spell W-A-T-E-R on Helen’s other hand. Suddenly Helen became very still.
Helen got it! She understood! She finally realized what Anne was doing. She realized that Anne was communicating with her. Helen then used her fingers to spell W-A-T-E-R into the palm of Anne’s hand. Next, Helen pointed to Anne and then to her own hand. Anne spelled out T-E-A-C-H-E-R. From that day forward, Helen called Anne teacher. Then Helen had Anne spell out the names of other things around her.
Helen learned to spell words as quickly as Anne could teach them to her! Next, Anne taught Helen to use her sense of touch to read. She taught Helen to read books printed in Braille. Braille uses raised dots instead of ink to make letters and words. Helen learned to feel words. Helen also learned to understand what people were saying by placing her fingers on their lips. As people said different words, Helen could feel their lips change shape.
Once Helen learned to communicate, a new world opened up to her. She went to college, and Anne went with her. Anne signed into Helen’s hand what teachers said during classes. She also made Braille notes for Helen to read. Helen graduated with Anne’s help.

Instead of chewing, I swallow my food through my snout. With only a small back fin, I am the slowest fish. I can stay in one place by latching my tail onto a piece of coral or seagrass.

I am the biggest turtle in the world—a leatherback turtle. Unlike most turtles, which have shells, my body is covered with leathery skin. I lay between eighty and one hundred eggs on land by digging a nest in the beach sand. Diving deep in the ocean and staying underwater for longer than an hour at a time, I travel long distances. Jellyfish are my favorite food.

In his office, Director Hansen asked Frankie how she and Gil figured out that it was Angela who frightened everyone. “I remembered Angela didn’t wake up when the prowler came,” Frankie said. “She must have stuffed her sleeping bag with pillows.” “And Angela left woodworking early; she said she was feeling sick,” Gil said. “The dining hall—she must have done that by sneaking out while everyone was sleeping,” Frankie said.

A bucketful of what? thought Alice. But she had not long to wonder, for a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the window. Some of them hit her in the face. “I’ll put a stop to this,” she said to herself. She shouted out, “You’d better not do that again!” which produced another dead silence.
Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor. A bright idea came into her head. If I eat one of these cakes, she thought, it’s sure to make some change in my size. As it can’t possibly make me larger, it must make me smaller, I suppose.
So she swallowed one of the cakes. She was delighted to find that she began shrinking. As soon as she was small enough to get through the door, she ran out of the house. She found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside.

Mr. Winn came by to see Dad and Mom last night. He offered to take care of the farm during the school year, while we’re away. Dad said he’d think about it. I hate it when he says that!
July 7
It’s a done deal! Dad agreed to keep the farm. He hired Mr. Winn to run it for us. I’ve never been so happy. As soon as I heard the news I ran out to tell Samson. I think he understood.
July 18
I can’t believe I have to go home. Mom and Dad need to get their classrooms ready for the new school year. I’m sure going to miss Mr. Winn, Henry, and everything about Aunt Rita’s house. But most of all, I’ll miss Samson. I can’t wait to get back to him and that old farm, even if it is a little stinky.",597.0
" The Tin Woodsman clanged his eyelids shut and drew back his ax. Miguel closed his eyes, too.
A cloud of thought and emotion swirled about his head before he awoke in the loft with his two friends. They had done it! Dorothy and her gang were back on track to Emerald City. “Was all that real?” Leo asked. Miguel nodded. “That was like a bad nightmare,” Trevon said. Miguel had a huge lump in his throat. “You two were the nightmares.” Trevon and Leo stared at Miguel. “All you care about is yourselves,” Miguel said. “We almost didn’t make it back because of you two.” “It was wrong how you wouldn’t help Dorothy,” Miguel said. “And it was cruel what we did to Dorian the other day.” Trevon’s eyes grew large. Leo fidgeted with the buttons on his shirt. “You can count me out of this friendship,” Miguel said. “See you guys around.” “Miguel, wait up.” Leo ran next to him, and Trevon blocked his path.
“We’ve been jerks,” Leo said. “I don’t know why we’ve been acting like this,” Trevon said. “We’re sorry.” Miguel’s heart felt lighter as they walked out of the shop and into the garden. “Thanks,” said Trevon, “for helping us find the right road.” “The yellow brick road?” Miguel asked. “Yeah, that’s the one.” The boys high-fived before Trevon and Leo walked home. Miguel saw Teresa in the garden. She had a slingshot in her pocket. “Wait a minute, you haven’t been reading The Wizard of Oz, have you?” Teresa giggled. “No, not really.” “Not really ?” “Well, I might have given Dorothy a little advice...” “Advice?” “How to stay on the yellow brick road, of course!” Teresa smiled, and so did Miguel.

" The water isn’t very deep. One day, Blackbeard, his four ships, and all of his men were sailing home with their treasure. Blackbeard sailed the Queen Anne’s Revenge too close to the land. His ship got stuck in the sand near a coastal town called Beaufort. Blackbeard told his men to move the treasure onto the other ships. He sent one of his captains away and dropped off many of his men on a nearby island. Then, Blackbeard sailed away, taking the loot with him. Had he wrecked his ship on purpose so he could keep the treasure for himself?
For a time, it seemed that Blackbeard had stopped being a pirate. He got married and bought a house. People stopped worrying about him. Blackbeard soon went back to his old life, though. He went to sea in his last ship, the Adventure. Blackbeard began attacking other ships again.
The governor of Virginia was tired of Blackbeard’s attacks. He sent a fighting ship called the Ranger to find and capture Blackbeard. One morning, the crew of the Ranger saw the Adventure near the island of Ocracoke.
The two ships fought, firing their cannons for many hours. In the heavy smoke from the cannon fight, the Ranger’s crew hid so it seemed as though they had been killed. Blackbeard thought he had won, so he climbed onto the Ranger. The Ranger’s crew jumped out from their hiding places and the fight began again. Blackbeard fought hard, but the Ranger had too many men. He was shot five times before he finally died. The Ranger’s crew threw Blackbeard’s body into the sea.
Blackbeard’s true story may be behind the colorful pirates in many books and movies. The next time you hear a pirate story, remember one of the real pirates in history: Blackbeard!",578.0

There were once millions of short- tailed albatrosses. These beautiful gull-like birds spend many years at sea before nesting. All the short-tailed albatrosses nested on a few islands around Japan.
About one hundred years ago, women loved to wear feathers in their hats. Hunters killed thousands of albatrosses for their feathers. Soon, there were none left on the islands. It seemed that the short-tailed albatross was extinct.
Years after the last albatross was seen, a few were spotted nesting on a volcanic island. These albatrosses had been at sea while the others were killed. They were the last short-tailed albatrosses alive. Today, the albatrosses’ island is protected. The birds are still in danger, though. The volcanic island might erupt, killing the last short-tailed albatrosses.
The California condor is the largest flying bird in North America. For many years, farmers, ranchers, and hunters shot and poisoned these birds.
In the 1980s, the last 27 living condors were caught. Now scientists take condor eggs and keep them warm until they hatch. Then, they hand-feed the chicks using condor puppets. The puppets help the chicks learn to live with other condors, instead of with humans. Once the chicks can fly, they are released into the wild.
The condors are still in danger after they are released. Some are shot. Others die by hitting power lines. Scientists still keep condors in zoos and raise chicks by hand. Someday all the condors may fly free.
There are many other endangered birds in the world. Most are dying out because of human activity. But people are now trying to save these rare and beautiful animals from extinction.",672.0

Mia got the lead role—a girl walking through a fairy forest in search of her lost dog. In the last scene, she finds a box under a giant mushroom. When she opens it, guess what jumps out? Mrs. Alvarez’s dog, Prince, played the dog role. She brought him to all the rehearsals. He liked all the kids, but he seemed to like me best.
The night of the show, my first line came early: “Let’s ask the Fairy Queen!” Dramatic stuff. At the end, when Mia opened the box, Prince jumped out as planned. He jumped into the giant mushroom, though, which fell over. Then he leaped off the stage and disappeared underneath it.
Mrs. Alvarez called him, but he whimpered and refused to come out. The lights came on in the theater, and the audience started to fidget in their seats. The entire class gathered at the edge of the stage. “How are we going to get him out of there?” Mrs. Alvarez asked.

" Cigarette smoke, fumes from cars, and other strong smells are also common triggers. Coming down with a cold or the flu can often bring on an attack as well. Exercise can cause an asthma attack in some people.
Most people with asthma learn to control the disease. They often start by meeting with their doctor to create an action plan. Each person’s action plan is a little different. It can include a person’s triggers and how to avoid them. It can also include the kinds of medicines a person uses and how to use them correctly.
People use different medicines to control asthma. Some people take pills every day. Others may take pills only when they feel the symptoms of asthma. Many people use inhalers. These devices spray a mist of medicine that is breathed in. Inhalers may be used daily or only when a person has an asthma attack.
Another important part of keeping asthma under control is staying healthy. Exercise, a healthy diet, and plenty of sleep can help keep asthma under control.
People with asthma can do anything that anyone else can. Many famous athletes have asthma. Jerome “The Bus” Bettis was fourteen when doctors told him he had asthma. It did not stop him from becoming a Super Bowl champion.
Amy Van Dyken was an Olympic swimmer for the United States. She has asthma and won six gold medals. When she was a child, her doctor said that she should start swimming to make her lungs stronger.
People with asthma have climbed the tallest mountains. They have explored the deep waters of the ocean. They have led countries and made discoveries that have changed the world. With an action plan and a healthy lifestyle, asthma doesn’t have to slow anyone down.",692.0

Bats are not the mean, frightening creatures that many people think they are. They don’t get into your hair or attack people, and there are no human vampires that turn into bats. The truth is that bats are shy, gentle creatures. In fact, bats are our friends. Just think of how many insects would be around if it were not for bats.
Can you imagine sleeping while hanging upside down with blood rushing to your head? Well, it’s not a problem for bats. Bats sleep upside down. They cling to the undersides of surfaces using the claws on their toes. Hanging upside down makes it easy to take off to fly. All they have to do is let go and begin flapping their wings.
Many bats hibernate in the winter when there are no insects to hunt. Before hibernating, bats eat lots of food, which they store as extra fat. They depend on this fat to survive during the winter. Some bats migrate to warmer areas during the winter. Red bats fly all the way from Canada to Mexico rather than spend the winter in the cold. There is even a bat in Europe that flies over 1,600 kilometers (1,000 mi) to spend the summer in Russia. Don’t expect to see bats migrating, since they fly at night.
Female bats give birth to one or two babies every year. They are the only flying animals that nurse their young on milk. After a baby bat is born, it crawls up to its mother’s chest and clings there with its claws. It feeds off its mother’s milk and even clings to the mother’s fur when she goes hunting. But baby bats don’t hang around for long. Many are able to fly and catch their own meals only three weeks after birth.",614.0

Achoo! Achoo!
His sneezing shook the house of sticks. Three more sneezes and the house fell down. The two panicked pigs ran off over the hill to their brother’s house of bricks. Their brother was sure the wolf couldn’t destroy his house. To be on the safe side, the pigs locked the doors and windows and hid in the safest room. When the two brothers had calmed down a bit, the three pigs sat down to a game of cards.
The wolf again came begging for food and shelter. He was delirious. The weather and the illness had sapped his strength. One last time, the wolf began to sneeze and sneeze. The brick house stood strong, but the wolf teetered until a final sneeze made him collapse in the drifting snow. The wolf lay there unconscious. After much time passed, a weasel pulling a sled found the wolf nearly frozen.
The weasel, being kind and concerned, struggled to pull the old wolf onto his sled.
The weasel finally managed to load up the wolf and tugged the sled to his house at the edge of the village. He helped the sick creature into bed, where he nursed the wolf back to health with vegetable broth. When spring came, the healthy wolf explained his terrible ordeal to the three pig brothers. The pigs were ashamed that they hadn’t realized what was happening.
The wolf didn’t blame them for misunderstanding. To make up for blowing down the two houses, the wolf helped the little pigs rebuild. Then all of the villagers joined together to build the wolf a new house. The wolf’s new neighbors also helped him plant a garden full of fresh vegetables. From that day on, the old wolf was never cold or hungry again, and he never sneezed another sneeze.",682.0

In the summer, the female leaf-rolling weevil rolls a leaf into a cone shape. She can take up to two hours getting the leaf just right. She lays her eggs inside the cone and then closes the open end. When the leaf falls to the ground in autumn, it carries the eggs with it. The leaf hides and protects the eggs until they hatch. When the larvae hatch, they eat the dead leaf.
The praying mantis often holds its front legs in a praying position. Mantises hide on plants to catch their food. Some mantises are green to blend in with leaves, and some that live in the desert are the color of sand. The praying mantis eats many types of insects as well as small frogs, lizards, and mice. Praying mantises can even catch and eat small birds such as hummingbirds.
burrow underground to find and eat earthworms. They also eat beetles, slugs, and snails. A mole digs many connected tunnels, creating a maze. It builds its nest deep in these tunnels. Because its fur points up, a mole can move backward and forward in a tunnel without getting dirt trapped in its coat. Moles have tiny eyes, but they are not blind.
Sea dragons are small fish that are related to sea horses. Their bodies have many parts that look like the stems and leaves of seaweed. They blend in with ocean plants, which helps them catch food and hide from enemies. Sea dragons use small, clear fins on their necks and backs to swim. The female lays eggs on the male sea dragon’s tail, and the male carries the eggs until they hatch.

" Bending light is called refraction. This process makes objects, such as a pencil sitting in a glass of water, appear to bend.
We can see rainbows in nature when direct light meets drops of rain. Sunlight refracts as it enters each drop. The light then reflects, or bounces, off the inside of each drop, like light off a mirror. The light refracts again as it exits the drop. Light refracts and reflects in millions of water droplets in the sky at the same time. This process makes all the colors of a rainbow.
Sunlight contains all the colors of a rainbow. Through refraction, raindrops disperse, or split, the sunlight into these colors. Sunlight splits into colors in each drop of rain. Each raindrop reflects colored light toward the viewer at a slightly different angle. We see red light shining from the drops at the top of a rainbow. Those drops are in the right position to shine the color red back at us. In the same way, the only color we see shining from the bottom of a rainbow is violet.
From top to bottom, colors in a rainbow always appear in the same order. However, the outside rainbow in a double rainbow breaks this rule. The name ROY G. BIV can help you remember the seven main colors of a rainbow: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet.
Rainbows make most people pause in awe. These colorful displays have inspired art and poetry throughout history. They also appear in stories and fairy tales from all over the world. Science explains how these optical illusions happen. Water drops bend, split, and reflect light, which lets us see a rainbow’s many colors. Still, the surprising beauty of a rainbow is a magical sight to see.",865.0
" Then, he heard another sound coming up behind him . . . a horse.
The horse and rider trotted up next to Ichabod, but it was too dark to see them. “Good evening,” Ichabod said. The rider said nothing. Up ahead, Ichabod could make out the church bridge. He started to ride a little faster. The rider matched his pace. “This is strange fog we’re having,” Ichabod said, trying to make conversation. Again, the rider said nothing. The moon slid out from behind a cloud. Ichabod looked over at the rider and froze. The rider had no head! In his hand, the rider held a huge pumpkin that seemed to glow in the moonlight. He raised it high above where his head should have been as it burst into flames.
Ichabod screamed and kicked the sides of his horse. The horse barely sped up. The safety of the church bridge waited up ahead. “Faster!” Ichabod yelled to his old plow horse. “Almost there.” The rider was close, but then Ichabod heard his horses’ hooves stomp on the wooden bridge. He sighed with relief. “I made it!” Ichabod screamed. He heard the rider’s horse behind him. He turned to look from the safety of the bridge. A flash of flames rushed toward him, and all went dark.
The next morning, a schoolboy discovered Ichabod’s horse grazing in a field by the church. On the ground next to the old bridge, he found Ichabod’s hat and a scorched pumpkin.

" Colonies even have rooms for ants to relax in.
Within the colony, every ant has a job and special skills to do that job. Worker ants and soldier ants find food and protect the nest. They are social insects and work together as a group. Worker ants are usually the ones you see above the ground. They are the older ants. Other ants build the nest, take care of the young, and do other jobs. The ants that work inside the nest tend to be younger ants. All these ants are female, but only one is allowed to lay eggs: the queen. In other words, all the ants in a colony are related.
The queen is the leader of the colony, but she doesn’t tell the other ants what to do. The largest of all the ants in the colony, the queen is an egg-laying machine. Some queens can lay thousands of eggs every day. Most colonies have only one queen. When other queen ants hatch, they must fly away and start other colonies. When they start laying eggs, they lose their wings. Queens can also live very long for insects—more than twenty-five years—but when they die, so does the colony.
Ants may be small, but they can do awesome things. Thousands or millions of ants working together can build bridges to cross a gap in their path. They can also shape themselves into boats to float across rivers safely. As a group, they can overpower animals hundreds of times their own size for food.
So the next time you come across a trail of ants, stop and watch. Better yet, follow them—just don’t step on their trail. When you see what these little gals are capable of, you’ll understand just how awesome they are.",684.0

“Yes,” he murmured. “You see, I really wanted to watch the circus being set up. And I know I promised to watch the mice for you.” Morty looked at his brothers and sisters. They had stopped slurping their soup, and all twelve wide eyes stared at him. “I’m sorry. I was thinking only about myself. I broke my promise to you, Mother.” Morty couldn’t tell if Mother was disappointed or angry. “Morty, you let me down, and you played a very mean trick on your brothers and sisters.” For the second time that day, Morty’s heart felt as if it would beat right out of his chest.
Maybe now was a good time to change the subject, he thought. “You know the fire-eating mouse?

You will use the money you saved for the circus to buy a bulk bag of oatmeal.” “Yes, Mother,” Morty murmured. “Also, I believe you have a bathroom to clean before dinner.” “Okay,” Morty said as he turned to leave the kitchen. Tears started to fall. He didn’t want his brothers and sisters to see how disappointed he was.
The bathroom was a mess. Hardened oatmeal covered the walls and floor. Morty used a shovel from the sandbox to get all the drain-clogging oatmeal out.

After the last turn, I expect to see the intense light of day. It’s only another fork, and I have no idea which way to go. I retrace the turns in my head, certain that I’ve followed them exactly.

“I think we need to light it,” she says. “I don’t have matches,” I reply. “Don’t play with matches,” Jake says. “I learned from a book how to start a fire in an emergency.” He drops to his hands and knees and starts combing along the ground. “Aha!” Jake exclaims and runs over with two plain-looking rocks. Sarah opens the lantern, and Jake scrapes the rocks together, sending sparks flying. After a few tries, a small flame catches on the oil-soaked wick.

Billy looked down, embarrassed. This wasn’t the first time he had daydreamed in class. “I don’t know,” he answered. Heather yawned in the seat in front of him. From her stretching arms, a note landed on Billy’s desk: “If you strike it rich, let us know. Love, Heather.” She started laughing. Billy saw that Jacob was laughing, too.

“I guess you understand Mom pretty well, don’t you?” she asked Chris. “I haven’t been too great about it lately,” he said. “She needs to get some feedback once in a while. And you need to apologize. Families have to work at staying together.” Amanda didn’t nod or say anything. She knew Chris would realize that he had made his point. After a short time, he got up and left the room, closing the door behind him. Amanda sat up, blew her nose, and got ready to clean herself up to talk to Mom.
“Three pickup trucks, five cars, a telephone van, two dogs, and a snapping turtle,” Cameron said, reading from a sheet of paper. “Those are all the things that passed by the fort window today, and not one of them knew I was behind here. This place is great! Where have you been?” he asked. Amanda had just arrived, and found Cameron. “Mom and I went to get our nails done,” Amanda said. “And we bought vines at the plant “Really—where are they? Can we plant them? Or don’t you want to mess up your pretty nails?”
“No, it’s not that. I made a deal with my mom. She’s bringing the vines and the hose for us. I said I’d go and have a ‘salon day’ with her if she came outside and helped us plant the camouflage on the fort this afternoon.” “No way!” Suddenly, water showered on them from somewhere. They looked up to see Mom dragging the dripping hose across the road. She aimed the sprayer right at them. “You two had better run!” she yelled, laughing. Cameron and Amanda took off, screaming with muddy delight.",526.0
" What would they do if she told them the truth? She was now linked to the entire Collective. That could mean they had access to her as well. Would they think she had been brainwashed or turned into a spy for the aliens? “I don’t remember,” she lied. “I’m sorry, but I’m really tired. Maybe something will come back to me later.” The doctor was about to speak when her dad said, “Okay, get some sleep. We’ll talk later.” The doctor flashed her dad a look, but they both left. Then she heard the door being locked from the outside.
Though she was tired and her head hurt, Charlotte stayed awake. The locked door meant they didn’t trust her, but could she blame them? Would she have trusted someone who spent an entire week in an alien Streed? Probably not. She checked the windows, but they were sealed shut. Could she break the glass without them noticing? Why was she thinking of escaping? She was safe in the compound, but this room felt more like a prison. Maybe it was just some animal instinct to flee when trapped. She wasn’t going anywhere, so she decided to try and sleep. As she lay in bed, her mind wandered. She found herself thinking about the information she had picked up from the link. She knew that the Collective had not been involved in the destruction of any of the civilizations. Time after time, they had watched what was happening from a distance without stepping in. She didn’t know whether that was worse. The Collective had felt incredibly sad, helpless, and frustrated watching those events unfold. Locked in her room in the Resistance compound, it was a feeling she understood all too well.",652.0
" “A merry Christmas, Bob,” said Scrooge, with an earnestness that could not be mistaken, as he clapped him on the back. “A merrier Christmas, Bob, my good fellow, than I have given you for many a year. I’ll raise your salary, and endeavour to assist your struggling family, and we will discuss your affairs this very afternoon, over a Christmas bowl of punch, Bob. Make up the fires, and buy another coal-scuttle before you dot another i, Bob Cratchit!” Scrooge was better than his word. He did it all, and infinitely more; and to Tiny Tim, who did not die, he was a second father. He became as good a friend, as good a master, and as good a man, as the good old city knew, or any other good old city, town, or borough, in the good old world.
Some people laughed to see the alteration in him, but he let them laugh, and little heeded them; for he was wise enough to know that nothing ever happened on this globe, for good, at which some people did not have their fill of laughter in the outset. And knowing that such as these would be blind anyway, he thought it quite as well that they should wrinkle up their eyes in grins, as have the malady in less attractive forms. His own heart laughed: and that was quite enough for him. He had no further interaction with Spirits. But it was always said of him that he knew how to keep Christmas well, if any man alive possessed the knowledge. May that be truly said of us, and all of us! And so, as Tiny Tim observed, God Bless Us, Every One!",1010.0

Spain belongs to a group of countries called the European Union. This group of countries works together to solve problems. People in Spain speak Spanish. Almost all people who were born there speak this language.
Most of Spain has mountains and high flatlands. Beautiful beaches line its coasts. The Pyrenees (PEER-uh- neez) mountains in the north make a border between Spain and France.
The mountains are 434 kilometers (270 mi.) long. They stretch from the Mediterranean Sea to the Atlantic Ocean. Different animals, such as the bearded vulture, live in the mountains.
Spain is very old. Long ago, people from different parts of the world came to live there. The Romans built roads and bridges. Then, other people arrived after the Romans. They built a beautiful palace that still stands today.
More than four hundred years ago, a king and queen ruled Spain. The king and queen were in charge of everything. They paid explorers like Christopher Columbus to sail on a ship and find new lands. Today, the people of Spain choose leaders to rule the country. Spain still has a king, but he does not make the laws.
The Spanish people enjoy celebrating holidays. National Day is a festival on October 12 every year. It marks the day that Columbus first arrived in the Americas. La Tomatina is a festival that happens every year in Spain. People throw tomatoes at one another and have fun.
Food Spanish people eat three meals a day. Lunch is their biggest meal. Many people like to eat rice with fish, beans, salads, pork, or lamb. Then they might have dessert, too!
Conclusion Spain has beautiful mountains and beaches. It also has friendly people. It is a special country that makes our world a much more exciting place to live in!",660.0
" Scientists study fossils to learn how dinosaurs moved around. Some dinosaurs walked on two or four legs, and some used wings to fly.
As dinosaurs moved around Earth, they left tracks behind. Scientists study fossil footprints to learn how fast or slow dinosaurs moved. Footprints also give clues about how big or small the dinosaur leaving the tracks might have been.
Scientists study fossil teeth to learn about the diets of dinosaurs. Many dinosaurs grew new teeth to replace those they had worn down or lost. Some dinosaurs had razor-sharp teeth that helped them cut through meat or plants. Others had flat teeth that they used to grind their food.
Scientists learn about dinosaur babies from fossil nests and eggs. Dinosaur eggs came in many different shapes and sizes. Some dinosaurs laid over twenty eggs at a time, while others laid only a few eggs. Like birds, some dinosaurs may have sat on their nests until their eggs hatched.
Scientists find fossils of plants, fish, insects, and other animals in the same rocks as dinosaur fossils. These fossils help them learn what Earth was like when dinosaurs lived here. It’s also easier for scientists to find the age of the other fossils than dinosaur fossils. The other fossils are more complete than dinosaur fossils. They’re also found more often. Scientists can estimate the age of dinosaur fossils based on the age of the other fossils.
How Long Ago?
Scientists can do tests to determine the age of fossils. Older fossils are found in rocks deep in the ground. Newer fossils are discovered in rocks closer to the surface. The oldest dinosaurs lived around 230 million years ago.
Scientists aren’t sure how or why dinosaurs disappeared 65 million years ago. Studying dinosaur fossils helps scientists look for clues to understand what happened.",650.0
" Iron is a type of metal. Mr. Eiffel wanted to prove that metal is as strong as stone.
First, stone and cement were placed in the ground. Next, the small pieces of iron were put together to make the large beams. Then, workers put the beams on top of the stone and cement. The tower grew taller and taller.
Long ago, structures were not as tall as they are today. Many people thought Mr. Eiffel could not build such a tall tower. Other people thought the tower would be ugly. When the Eiffel Tower was finished, it was beautiful!
Mr. Eiffel wanted to make the tower useful to people so it would stay standing for many years. He put a science lab in the tower. Many people came to use the lab. Later, people used the tower to send radio and TV signals. The first French radio station with news and music began in 1921. It sent signals from the tower.
Take a ride in a glass elevator to the top of the Eiffel Tower. The city of Paris looks amazing from that high! The second floor has shops, restaurants, and displays about how the tower was built. The first floor has a see-through floor. There is also ice-skating every winter.
The Eiffel Tower doesn’t always look the same. Workers paint it every seven years, and sometimes the color changes. The tower has been dark red, dark yellow, and brown at different times. It’s always huge and amazing!
In 2004, the Eiffel Tower’s lights were red for the Chinese New Year. In 2006, the lights were blue for another holiday. They were green and gold for a big sports contest in 2007. The tower had a special show of lights and fireworks to welcome the year 2000. Something fun is always happening at the tower!",623.0

This system takes care of breathing. Oxygen is part of the air that you breathe. Air enters through your nose and mouth. It travels to your lungs through your trachea, or windpipe. Once air is in your lungs, blood removes the oxygen and takes it to the cells of your body. Your lungs also remove carbon dioxide from blood. The carbon dioxide leaves your body every time you breathe out.
The circulatory system is made up of your heart and blood vessels. Your heart pumps blood through your body. It never rests. Blood delivers food and oxygen to every cell in your body. It also picks up waste products from cells and takes them to the lungs and kidneys. The waste then leaves your body.
Digestion breaks down the food you eat. Food must be broken into very tiny particles so that it can be carried by the blood to cells. When food enters your mouth, it mixes with saliva, or spit. Saliva begins digesting the food. When you swallow, food travels down a long tube to your stomach, where it mixes with other chemical that digest it more.
Then the food enters your small intestine. Here, more chemicals mix with the food. Blood moving through the walls of the small intestine carries away the digested food. Food that is not digested continues on to your large intestine. It is then removed as waste.
Humans must reproduce in order to survive. Special organs and glands in the reproductive system allow humans to make new human beings.
This is a look at some important systems in your body. Many other parts also help you stay strong and healthy. You can help your body do its job by eating well and getting exercise. You can also help by avoiding stress and unsafe situations.",780.0
" That’s more than 22 miles (36 km) per hour for a large dragonfly. When a dragonfly zips into high speed, it speeds up faster than the world’s fastest race cars! Male dragonflies defend their homes against other males. If they spot an intruder, they “fight” by performing high-speed flight displays. These contests let dragonflies show off their speed and size without being hurt.
Unlike most flying insects, dragonflies control each wing independently. They can hover like helicopters or swoop and dive like fighter jets. They can fly forward, backward, and even upside down.
An adult dragonfly is a high-speed flying predator, one of the most successful hunters in the animal world. Scientists say that a dragonfly catches its prey more than nine times out of ten. Compare that to a lion, which catches its dinner only one out of four tries. Dragonflies can deliver rapid, powerful bites. They surprise mosquitoes and other small insects by attacking from behind and below. They often eat their catch without bothering to land.
Dragonflies’ flying skills help them avoid most predators. Many animals like to eat dragonflies—birds, lizards, frogs, spiders, and even other dragonflies. Not many can catch these speedy insects. Humans eat dragonflies, too. In many parts of the world, dragonflies are a special treat. You can buy them threaded onto sticks like skinny corn dogs.
Sometimes dragonflies gather in huge groups, or swarms. They may swarm to feed on large numbers of insect prey found in one place. They also swarm to fly south as the weather cools, the way birds travel south for the winter.
There are nearly three thousand kinds of dragonflies. They are found all around the world, in almost every kind of habitat. Check out a nearby stream, pond, or lake, and see if you can spot these fancy fliers for yourself!",863.0
" When Sarah turned eleven, her parents said she could babysit Noah and they would pay her. She would still be too young to babysit other people’s children, but at least she could babysit Noah. Sarah thought that in that way, she would be close to being sixteen. At eleven she could babysit Noah and earn money and buy the things she wanted, like blue nail polish.
In fact, that was another way she would be like a sixteen-year-old. She could use her own money and buy things she wanted. It wasn’t like an allowance, with her parents still saying yes or no to what she bought. She would earn the money so the decisions about what she could spend it on would be hers—just like a sixteen-year-old.
Sarah completed the last line in the table: can spend my money on what I want. Then it was there in lavender and blue. At eleven, she would be a whole lot closer to being sixteen than she was at ten. Actually, if you look at it one way, eleven was only five words away from sixteen. That’s when it dawned on her.
Eleventeen! That’s what she would be! Like a teenager—responsible, able to earn money, and make her own decisions about how to spend it—but not yet a teenager in years. Besides, she thought, it’s more important to act older than to be older. Her dad was right—when you have a dilemma, all you have to do is weigh the facts. Sarah knew people might ask her what she meant when she told them she’s eleventeen, but that was no problem.

“Why are you in the Hollow by yourself?” I ask, mainly just to listen to something besides the scary noises. “I just go there—I don’t know why,” he says. “It’s not a bad place. I can hear other kids there sometimes. They’re always playing, but I can’t find them. I like listening to them because it makes me feel like I’m not alone.” I feel sad for the kid, being all by himself on Halloween. No wonder he was trying to scare us. He probably just wants some attention. I decide that once we’re on the road, we’ll take him to a few houses to trick-or-treat before taking him home.
The laughter on the wind follows us. Sometimes it seems so close, and other times it’s far behind. I stop a few times and look around for what might be making the sounds. I don’t see anything, but the expression on Sarah’s face says she hears the laughter, too. Jake and Odie keep happily trudging along, so we don’t say anything.

" As she waited at the foot of the stairs, the attic door eased open. A little girl crept out and picked up the doll. Then she looked up and spotted Virginia.
The frightened little girl gasped and started to cry. Before Virginia could comfort the girl, a hand whisked her back into the attic and slammed the door. Now Virginia knew the secret her parents had been keeping from her: the people in the attic were not ghosts; they were fugitives — slaves escaping to freedom in the north. Virginia once heard her parents whispering about the Underground Railroad, which was not a real railroad, with trains and tracks, but a collection of routes and homes fugitives could use to escape to Canada. They could find freedom in Canada. Virginia’s parents were stationmasters on the Underground Railroad, and now, so was she. A few days later, Virginia realized the ghosts were gone. One of them had left a gift for her on the attic stairs. It was the small doll made from cornhusks. She kept it, but not for herself. If ever another family should stop at their “station,” she would have something to offer them other than her own fear.
Around the 1830s, the effort to help slaves escaping from the southern United States was called the Underground Railroad. Although it was against the law, many individuals, both black and white, opened their homes to help these fugitives find freedom. Families like Virginia’s often fed, clothed, and hid small groups of fugitives until it was safe for them to move farther north. It could take from several months to an entire year for fugitives to make it north to Canada, one of the only places they could be truly safe and free.",972.0

Her mom understood that Hannah was just very, very sad, but she knew that it was important for Hannah to go. The funeral was an opportunity for Hannah to say goodbye to him and to feel supported by other people who had also loved him. Hannah snuggled up to her mom during the funeral and listened while many family members and friends took turns talking about what Grandpa had meant to them.

Gram called us when the clams opened their shells. She put some salt, pepper, and butter on them. They were a grayish color when we dug them. Now cooked, they were almost white.

" So these two together destroyed the enemy of the people. To Beowulf, that was the greatest moment of his life, when he saw his work was done. The wound that the dragon gave him began to burn and swell, for poison had entered it. He knew that the tale of his days was told. Wiglaf gently took off his helmet and brought him water. Beowulf said, “I have ruled this people fifty years, and no king has dared attack them. I have ruled with justice, and no friend has lost his life through me. Though I am sick with deadly wounds, I have comfort in this. Now go quickly, Wiglaf. Show me the treasure that I have won for my people so that I may die in peace.” Wiglaf quickly entered the dragon’s den. On every side he saw gold, jewels, vases, helmets, and bracelets. Overhead was a marvelous golden banner gleaming with light.
Wiglaf brought treasures to Beowulf and laid them on the ground. “I thank God,” said the dying king, “that I have won this treasure for my people. Now they will have all that they need, but I cannot be here any longer. Tell my men to bury my ashes in a high mound on the headland overlooking the sea. In times to come, men shall call it Beowulf’s Barrow. It shall guide sailors over the stormy seas.” The brave king took from his neck his golden collar and removed his helmet and his coronet.

Where do you live? Do you live in the rainforest? What about in a desert, tundra, or pine forest? Do you live on the coast, up in the mountains, or out on the plains? You must live somewhere, right? If you live in a town or city, sometimes it can be hard to tell what kind of region you live in. But there are clues all around. What kinds of trees and bushes grow nearby? What kinds of birds fly overhead? What is the weather like? Look around and investigate. If you are not sure, ask your teacher, librarian, parent, or friend. Once you figure it out, make a report. Draw a picture like the one on page 10, but make it for your area. What kind of insects, plants, and animals are native to your home? You could find this information by walking around outside. You could also ask other people. Or you could read a book, or search the Web. You’ll probably be surprised by the cool things you learn about your neighbors!",660.0
" Our responsibility is to save your species as a whole and the planet. This is the only way. Charlotte didn’t say anything. She thought of all the civilizations that had destroyed themselves. All those lives lost because they failed to see the consequences of their actions. She thought about the innocent people living in the developments. She realized she couldn’t save them. The aliens were only doing what they thought was right, but she knew it wasn’t. There had to be a better way. She would help them and her species The explosion in the city could be seen from the Resistance compound, many miles away.
For days after the attacks on the housing developments, governments raided Resistance compounds around the world. The news channels showed a video of Charlotte being rescued from a makeshift prison. She became famous as the only person ever rescued so dramatically from both the aliens and the Resistance. Not long after being freed, Charlotte found herself standing before a crowd of reporters at a press conference. Just breathe, Artie said in her mind. Remember, your species needs people like you, people who will lead and make the tough choices to help everyone. Charlotte nodded to one of the cameras and stepped up to the microphone. “Hello everyone,” she began. “I’d like to tell you about my time with both the Resistance and the Collective, but let me start by saying we are all flawed. I’ve learned that if we work together, we may just survive the challenging time ahead. We’ll need to grow up and evolve as a species, but that’s been the story of life since its beginning. And for the first time in history, we do not have to do this alone . . .”",829.0

Abigail married John Adams in 1764. John worked as a lawyer. He was often away from home because of his work. Abigail took care of the farm and their money.
Soon after Abigail and John were married, Great Britain began to treat the colonies unfairly. People had to pay many high taxes. Abigail, John, and many others wanted the colonies to become independent.
John left the farm to help the colonies break away from Great Britain. Abigail cared for their children and ran their farm. A woman running a business was not common at the time.
Abigail thought John’s work was important. She and John wrote many letters while he was away. Abigail shared her ideas about helping the colonies become independent. John listened to her ideas.
The colonies went to war with Great Britain to become independent in 1775. John kept working to help the colonies become free. Abigail made meals and cared for soldiers who were hurt. She wrote to John about what was happening.
The war ended in 1781, and the colonies became a new country—the United States of America. George Washington became the first U.S. president in 1789. John became the first vice president.
John became president in 1797. As First Lady, Abigail spoke out against slavery and in favor of equal rights for women. Some people did not like it when Abigail spoke out. They sometimes called her Mrs. President. Abigail never stopped talking about what she believed.
Abigail and John moved back to their farm when his four years as president were over. Many years later, in 1818, Abigail died.
Abigail Adams was a smart woman who made a difference in many ways. Her ideas were important to the birth of the United States. She showed the world that women can speak up and work for important causes.",759.0

I’d like to be an athlete, and play basketball each day. I’d leap so high I could touch the sky, and make baskets along the way.
I’d like to be a gardener and grow healthy things to eat. I’d plant my seeds, water them, and pull weeds. My garden would be hard to beat.
I’d like to be a mermaid and swim in the deep blue sea. The fish and whales could tell their tales, while dolphins sang to me.

Almost all parrots have large, curved bills with a pointed upper half and a short, strong lower half. Parrots are sometimes called hookbills because their upper bills are shaped like hooks. Strong bills allow many parrots to crack open nuts and fruits that other animals can’t. Parrots also use their bills to hold objects, clean their feathers, and help them climb.
All parrots have four toes on each foot, with two toes pointing forward and two pointing backward. They use their feet for climbing, cleaning their heads and beaks, and grabbing and holding objects. They are the only birds that hold their food in one foot while they eat it.
Parrots have large, round heads with eyes on the sides. Most have circles of skin around their eyes where there are no feathers. Some parrots have a crest, or crown, of feathers on the top of their heads. Cockatiels and cockatoos can raise and lower the feathers on their crests. They use their crests to communicate with other birds and to scare away predators.
Parrots eat fruits, nuts, seeds, flowers, and other plant parts. Some also eat insects and other small creatures. A few kinds of parrots feed on nectar, a sugary liquid made by flowering plants. These parrots have special tongues that help them get nectar from flowers.
Most parrots live in warm rainforests in tropical and subtropical areas. Central America, South America, and the islands in and around Australia have the greatest variety of parrots.
Only a few kinds of parrots build nests. Most parrots live in hollow spaces that grow naturally in tree trunks. Some dig holes in cliffs, banks, or the ground.
Parrots are the rock stars of the bird world. Their beauty, intelligence, and playfulness have made them popular with people everywhere.",765.0
" Romans took over Petra in 106. People’s lives mostly stayed the same. They built new structures that looked more like Roman structures. A huge earthquake in 363 broke Petra’s water system. People started leaving the city at that time. Another big earthquake happened in 551. Arabs took over Petra about a hundred years later. The last people left Petra soon after.
Many of Petra’s structures are carved right into the mountains. Others are built from sandstone taken from the mountains. A few structures use both methods. Scientists are certain that Petra’s carved structures were made from the top down. They know this because some structures were never finished. They are only carved at the top. No one knows for sure how the Nabataeans made the carved structures. Some scientists think they removed large blocks of sandstone, leaving huge rock steps. Carvers would have stood on the steps as they worked up high.
Other scientists think the carvers put strong pins into the rock. Then they rested a wooden board on the pins. They would have stood on the board while they worked. Scientists hope to learn more as they keep studying Petra.
More than four hundred thousand people visit Petra each year. No cars are allowed, so many people walk through the Siq to get there. Others ride a horse, donkey, or camel. Visitors walk around Petra on their own. It can take up to five days to see everything!
Scientists learn more about Petra all the time. Not long ago, they found pools, gardens, and fountains. Every discovery shows more about how smart the Nabataeans were. They figured out how to bring water to a very dry desert. Long ago, people came to Petra because of water. More than two thousand years later, they come to see a beautiful rock city.",593.0
" They lowered a net next to the dog, but he was too scared to climb into it. The dog even slipped and fell into the cold water while they were trying to help him. Luckily, he was able to climb back onto the slippery ice.
Fearing that the dog would drown, the crew lowered a raft. Adam, the ship’s mechanic, used the raft to get close to the dog. Adam grabbed the dog by the back of the neck and pulled him into the raft.
Once the dog was safe aboard the ship, the crew dried him and wrapped him in blankets. They rubbed him with towels to warm him up. At first, the dog was too weak to stand. He curled up and went to sleep on a blanket. After a good nap, the dog was strong enough to join the crew for breakfast and eat some sausages.
The crew named the dog Baltic after the name of the sea where they rescued him. Once the ship returned to port, they took Baltic to a veterinarian. The vet made sure Baltic hadn’t suffered any serious injuries from his icy adventure. The crew also searched for Baltic’s owners for several weeks but couldn’t find them. Adam, the sailor who pulled Baltic into the raft, decided to adopt him.
Now, Baltic is the mascot of the research ship that found him and travels with the crew everywhere. He has many fans around the world who learned about his incredible journey and rescue. The president of Poland even wrote a letter to the crew of the ship, praising them for saving Baltic’s life. Baltic started out cold, wet, and alone on the ice but ended up warm, dry, and surrounded by new friends.",775.0
" The coach told Mateo that he could try pitching, and he quickly struck out every boy. “That’s what I call a pitcher!” the coach cried.
Later that afternoon, the coach put the boys into two teams for a game and chose Mateo to pitch. Mateo proceeded to throw a perfect game, and everyone, even the twins, was thrilled. With a superstar like this, surely their team would win the Little League World Series!
The instant the game ended, Mateo tried to leave, but the boys and the cheering spectators mobbed him. In the scuffle, Mateo lost one pink shoe. When he finally broke free and fled home, he felt his uniform vanishing into thin air. He looked down to see that he was dressed like an ordinary boy, except with only one ragged shoe. The other foot was bare. The coach was left holding the pink shoe. “I must find that fantastic kid,” he said.
The next day, the coach went door to door, visiting every home in the town. Wherever he found a boy, he had him try on the pink shoe. It fit no one. Finally, the coach arrived at Mateo’s house. The twins almost knocked each other over in a rush to try on the pink shoe. No matter how hard the boys wriggled their toes and pushed, it was still too small. Then, the coach spotted Mateo.
“Come here, my boy, and try on this shoe,” the coach said. The twins guffawed, but when the shoe slipped on perfectly, they both gasped, “Cinderello!” Mateo looked at the twins and said, “My name is Mateo.” “Mateo will be our captain, and he will lead us to victory!” the coach announced.

" The first thing Edison recorded was “Mary Had a Little Lamb.” Some people didn’t believe the machine worked. They thought someone was talking in another room! The phonograph made Edison famous.
For years, people had tried to make a safe light bulb that most people could buy. Many inventors had tried and failed. First, Edison and his team had to find the right filament—the part of a light bulb that glows. They tried thousands of materials. They finally found one that worked. People were amazed by Edison’s electric lights.
Edison then had to make a system that could light a building and even a city. In 1881, Edison moved to New York City. He helped start the first electric power plant. In time, many places began to use electric lights.
In 1887, Edison moved to a new lab in New Jersey. Around that time, he saw a machine that quickly played many images one after another. The things in the images looked as if they were moving! Edison had his team work on two machines. One machine would record the images, and the other would show them. Edison and his team invented a movie camera. They also invented a machine to show the images. Edison tried to put sound with the images, but it did not work.
Edison continued to invent. Some of his other inventions included machines to mine materials, better batteries, and new uses for cement. During his life, Edison had 1,093 patents, which was a record at the time. He worked until he was more than eighty years old. Thomas Edison died on October 18, 1931. President Herbert Hoover asked people to turn out their lights for a short time. He asked them to think about the great changes Thomas Edison had made in their lives.",717.0
" That’s when I saw him—a giant tiger- striped tomcat. The little kitty tried to dive past him out the window, but his paw swatted her back inside.
The little kitty let out a sound that would have made a tiger proud. The tomcat dove at her like a jaguar, and they ran around the room in circles. The little kitty leapt straight up to the ceiling. Now, if she had stayed up there I might have avoided what happened next. But that crazy cat landed right on sleeping Murray’s head! The dog woke up and growled, the cats yowled, and I howled, “Stop!”
Now, up-ended tables and a floor littered with hard candies that nobody eats anyway wouldn’t have been a terrible result for a science experiment gone haywire. But during the cat and dog chase, a bunch of squirrels and a family of freeloading raccoons chowed down on the trails of Murray’s food! Murray, doing his duty as a watchdog, stopped chasing the cats and went after the squirrels and raccoons. What a mess they made! No wonder they’re considered wild animals.
Fortunately, (well, maybe not) another uninvited guest arrived at the party—a skunk. The skunk let loose a spray of skunk juice that set off another round of yowling, growling, and howling, plus some screeching and shrieking. The cats and dogs and squirrels and raccoons and skunks and who knows what other wildlife thankfully took the chase outside. I know I should have left a note for Dad and Gattie saying where I was going, but I didn’t have time. Besides, I had no idea where I was going. I hopped on my bike and chased after the chase.

Aster beamed and nodded; Mike’s head lifted bit by bit. “Yeah,” he said, almost to himself, “I just went about it wrong.” Whenever Mike got excited, his right foot jiggled.

I want a business that can go and go. There’s a word for that. What’s that word?” “Sustainable,” his mom said.
“Right!” cried Mike. “I want a business that’s sustainable. The demand has to be sustainable—something people actually want or need—but the supply has to be sustainable, too, because... business is forever.” He handed Pickles to his sister, pushed back his covers, and jumped to his feet.

" The third man ran when he realized he was now outnumbered. When the conflict ended, I was standing against a tree and felt a shooting pain in my left shoulder. I looked down and saw a knife blade sticking out of my shirt and felt warm blood trickling down my arm. One of Gold’s men had thrown a knife and hit me.
I screamed when the doctor pulled out the blade. It had only nicked my skin, but the pain was intense. I noticed the rope around my waist was loose, and I looked for Gold but didn’t see him. Gold was gone. He must have escaped in the commotion. Two of the boxes of money were also missing. After we gathered the survivors of the captain’s men and helped them to the boat, we loaded the rest of the money onto the ship. We planned to send the police for Gold’s men when we arrived back in Seattle. I think we were all glad to be rid of Gold, and no one seemed too concerned that he had escaped. When we reached Seattle, we turned over the money we had to the authorities. It was much less than the total that originally went missing. We figured there was still some money that Gunn had stashed on the island. We were given a reward of $25,000, a lot less than the money we could have kept, but it was enough. There was plenty of money in my share to help my parents fix their inn. So, that is the story of the treasure in Puget Sound. It is an unpleasant memory I have recorded, but it needed to be told. To this day, I still have nightmares. I still can hear Gold’s parrot: “The boy knows. The boy knows.”",727.0

The next day, with Colin in his wheelchair and the robin nestled in his lap, Miguel used his song to lead his friends through the pasture and down the pathway to the oaks and ivy surrounding the secret garden.
Despite his broken wing, Miguel managed to flitter onto the piece of ivy near the doorknob.
“The door to the secret garden!” Mary pulled out a key, stuck it in the lock, and turned it. Click.
As they walked in, Miguel felt a tingle of energy surge through his body.
Colin gasped. Mary ran in circles. Dickon laughed with joy. They had found the long sought-after garden!
However, the once-beautiful garden now had vines covering everything, and most of the other plants seemed dry and lifeless. But Miguel knew the trio could bring it back to life. Miguel knew that because of his help, the poppies, roses, and hollyhock would soon be in full bloom. Mary would be entertaining Colin and Dickon, and Colin would need his wheelchair less and less. Maybe Miguel’s dad was right about gardens. They are places of healing.
Miguel lifted off the ground, encircling the garden a few times. He looked down on the three smiling kids and then shot through the clouds. Before he knew it, he was home in the quiet loft. A lavender rose lay on top of the chest.
Back outside, Miguel’s dad was still pruning the roses. He held a bouquet full of colors, all except lavender. For the first time, Miguel found he enjoyed the sweet scent of roses.

" Then I caught sight of a glittering reflection in a nearby stream. The water rippled and twinkled, ever so slightly, as it reflected the stars above.
Ideas in my brain ignited like sparks in dry brush. The stream ended in a lake at the manor. Of course! I needed to follow the water. “We’re going home!” I yelled, which came out in long, happy neighs. I shook my head and leapt around in circles. “Whoa, Beauty!” the doctor yelled, laughing and clinging to the reins. I stood in front of the fork in the road and I turned to the right. With the sparkling water shining proudly next to me, off I ran. Through the darkness. Into the hills. To the manor. To my mistress. “Hee-yah!” the doctor yelled.
And with that, I found myself back in the loft. My heart still racing, I stood up and leapt in circles again. “Neeeeiighhh!” I yelled, climbing down the stairs and into the shop. There, I found Trevon and Leo staring at me. “What are you so happy about?” Leo asked. “Oh, nothing,” Miguel said. “Why are you guys here?” “The Black Cobras gave us another chance,” Trevon said. “Six-thirty tonight,” Leo said. “And we got the map, see?” He fumbled through his backpack and pulled out a yellow sheet of paper.
“That’s not a map, that’s your math homework,” Miguel said, laughing. “What?” They searched the pack. “I must have turned in the map instead of my homework!” Leo stomped his foot. Miguel laughed again. “What are you laughing at?” Trevon asked. “Nothing.” “We’re going to miss the game, again!” Leo said. “No, don’t worry, guys.” Miguel grabbed his glove and walked toward the door. “You’ve got me!”",573.0
" Swahili and English are the two main languages of Kenya.
Most people live in the countryside. Many farm the land. They grow food to feed their families. They also grow crops to sell. Tea, coffee, corn, and wheat are some of the main crops.
Kenya has low land along the Indian Ocean. The land rises to become highlands in the west. The highlands include mountains and raised, flat areas.
The Great Rift Valley splits the highlands. This valley is a crack in the land that was made millions of years ago. It is 6,400 kilometers (3,977 mi.) long. The valley has deserts and lakes.
People from Kenya celebrate many special days. Great Britain ruled Kenya for many years. On December 12, 1963, Kenya became a free country. Every December 12, people celebrate with feasts, parades, and dancing.
Kenya’s camel race festival starts in late August. It lasts for three days. People come from all over the world to race camels. At the festival, visitors also enjoy bike races, dancing, and local foods. They buy arts and crafts made by different tribes.
Kenya is famous for its wild animals. Some of them are very rare. Kenya has more than fifty parks and protected areas for animals. Every year, many people travel to Kenya to see these animals. Giraffes, zebras, and other grazing animals fill Kenya’s savannas. Lions and cheetahs live on the savannas, too.

" Bundles of palm wood twigs stick out from the mosque’s tall brown walls.
The prayer wall faces east toward the city of Mecca, which is where the Islamic religion began There are three towers on the main wall Five times a day, someone climbs the center tower to call Muslims to prayer.
The Great Mosque of Djenné is made of mud. Builders used mud to make bricks and other building supplies. They made bricks by baking mud in the sun. They used mud to hold the bricks together as they built the wall, too. They also used mud to coat the wall and give it a smooth look.
Because of the changing weather in West Africa, builders placed bundles of sticks in the walls. These bundles stick out from the walls and help keep the walls from cracking. The sticks are useful in another way, too. Workers use them to climb the walls when they fix the mosque each year.
The mosque’s walls crack in the heat and rain. Every year, the town of Djenné has a festival to put new mud on the mosque’s walls. People gather fine clay soil from the Niger and Bani Rivers and mix a mud paste in special pits.
At the start of the festival, there is a race. Workers race the paste from the pits to the mosque walls. The men climb the walls and apply the mixture to the cracked walls. During the festival, musicians entertain the workers. Older people watch younger people work while young children sing, run, and play.
Today, many mosques are updated with electricity and plumbing. The people of Djenné want to keep the building as it is. They only added outside lights and a speaker system. The Great Mosque is important in their lives and religion.",741.0

By Monday morning, the puzzle was nearly complete. By Monday afternoon, less than ten pieces were left, and Becky was starting to celebrate! It was a beautiful picture . . . but wait . . . a piece was missing! MISSING! Becky looked on the floor, on the couch, even under the puzzle. “Mom! Dad!” she hollered, “a piece is MISSING!” They combed through every inch of the dining room and kitchen. They checked under the rug, in back of the bookcase, underneath the couch cushions—no puzzle piece anywhere. Becky’s mouth was turned down. A defective puzzle! Who would have known? It wasn’t 300 pieces, it was 299! “Okay, Becky, I have an idea,” said Dad.
They carefully glued the finished puzzle onto poster board and hung it next to the other four in Becky’s bedroom. The missing piece wasn’t even noticeable. They had found a little picture of their cat, Snowball, and cut it into the shape of the missing piece. The face of Snowball peered out where the baby lion’s face was supposed to be in the puzzle. Little Snowball didn’t look nearly as ferocious. So, it looked really neat, after all. And Becky was very proud of her dad for coming up with such a brilliant idea!
On Tuesday, Becky was scrambling to get ready for school. She found the missing puzzle piece in the cuff of her jeans. Stunned, she looked at it. Now that Snowball was in the picture, what should she do? She quickly compared the two pieces and decided she liked her version better. She taped the missing piece to the edge of the finished puzzle.

" Butterflies and moths have sense organs in their antennae, mouth parts, legs, feet, and other parts of their bodies. These sense organs help them find food, mates, and plants on which to lay eggs.
Some butterflies and moths that live in cold places migrate to warmer places before winter begins. The best known butterfly that migrates is the monarch butterfly. Monarchs in North America begin their long journey south when it begins to cool off in late summer or fall. Monarchs living west of the Rocky Mountains fly to several places on the California coast. Monarchs living east of the Rockies fly as far as 4,800 kilometers (2,982 mi) to Mexico. When they reach warmer places, millions of them rest in trees through the winter. In spring, they migrate north again in search of plants on which to lay their eggs. No one knows how monarchs find their way.
Over the years, people have collected butterflies and moths for scientific study and as a hobby. Scientists and others have learned a great deal about these insects from collections. However, millions of these beautiful insects have lost their lives because of collectors. Watching butterflies and moths while they are alive is much kinder and also more interesting. You can learn a great deal about their similarities and differences just by watching them fly and feed. Take pictures of them or catch them in a net for a closer look (don’t touch!) and then let them go. View photos of your favorite species on the Internet or in a book. Build or visit a butterfly garden and keep a journal to record their activities. However you choose to enjoy butterflies and moths, remember that they are among nature’s most amazing insects.",901.0

The dentist smiled and shook her head. “Your mouth is perfect just the way it is,” she said. Curses, Mike thought. “How many teeth will I lose this year?” he asked. “None,” said the dentist. “None!” cried Mike. “You lost a bunch when you were Aster’s age,” she said. “You’ll lose some more when you’re ten or so.” Mike scratched his head in frustration. “What about my wisdom teeth?” he asked.
“Well,” the dentist said, “you’ve got to get them before you can lose them.” “When will that be?” Mike asked eagerly. “Depends on the person,” the dentist said. “College, maybe.” Mike frowned fiercely. He needed wisdom now!

Why in the heck had he sold it? “I’ll buy a coat at the thrift store,” Mike mumbled. “Oh no,” said his mom. “We’re buying that one back.” That afternoon, Mrs. McCarthy marched Mike back up to the counter of Twice Nice.

Mike shook his head. “Me neither,” Violet whispered, “but this is where I sell.”
Mike watched Violet and her aunt sell to the same buyer. Today his fingernails were magenta, Mike noticed, and something else: after looking through Violet’s pile of clothes, the guy took almost everything. Mike watched her accept a stack of cash. He sighed—she made business look so easy— and turned back to the manager. “Normally, we wouldn’t do this...” the manager started, but with a single look, Mrs. McCarthy shut her down. The manager sold the coat back to Mike at cost—the twenty dollars they had paid him for it. The jeans, however, were already gone.

“Why didn’t you tell me?” “Maybe I was waiting for the right time.” Miguel’s mom winked. “You know the most magical thing about him?” Miguel’s heart raced. “What?” “He loved to read more than anything else.” Miguel smiled. His mom smiled back. Thanks to The Great Gallardo’s books, maybe Miguel did too. He couldn’t wait to find more adventures in the glittery black chest in the loft.",571.0
" First they pulled on one side, and then they pulled on the other. The statue rocked back and forth. The moai moved forward little by little as the people pulled. The moai was walking!
What happened to the people of the island is another mystery. Some scientists think that as many as ten thousand people lived on Easter Island around the year 1300. They think this because they study how much trash was left behind by the early people on the island.
Yet explorers from Europe found less than three thousand people living on the island in the 1700s. By that time, there were only a few trees left. The people of the island weren’t growing much food. The visitors found moai lying on the ground, pushed over by the island people. Some finished moai were left along paths to the sea. What happened?
Scientists have many ideas about what happened to the islanders. One idea is that the people of the island cut down too many trees. Or maybe rats that came to the island with the people ate the tree seeds. Without trees, people would not have been able to build fishing boats. Soil for growing crops would have washed away without tree roots to hold it in place.
Another idea is that the number of people on the island grew too fast. The island was not big enough to grow food for everyone. Some scientists think the people of the island had a war. Others think that many of them got sick and died. No one knows for sure what happened to the people.
Today, scientists work to understand writing left by the early people of the island. Others study designs on the partly buried moai. These clues, and other new discoveries, may someday help explain the mysteries of Easter Island.",754.0

All pennies are made at the U. S. Mint. First, the mint asks an artist to draw pictures for the coin’s front and back. When the drawings are perfect, the artist carves them into a sculpture called a relief. A machine uses a model of the relief to carve the drawing into a hard steel stamp.
Each coin starts off as a cut blank, or coin-shaped piece of metal. Blanks are plain and flat, with no pictures or words. Penny blanks used to be made of 100 percent copper. Today they are made of copper and zinc.
The cut blanks are heated until they become soft. Then they go through a washer and dryer. Next, a machine pushes up a rim around the edge of each blank. Look closely at a penny. It has a raised edge around it.
Then, each blank is struck. The hard stamp with the artist’s relief on it slams into the blank. It presses the pictures and words right into the metal.
Then, a worker uses a magnifying glass to check the pennies. The finished pennies are counted, put into bags, and sent to banks around the United States.
Today, the U.S. Mints in Denver and Philadelphia make all the coins in the United States, including me. They make billions of pennies each year. Can you guess how much it costs to make one penny? 1.4 cents! It costs more than a penny to make a penny!

“I think I’ve seen those scissors before,” Sarah says, staring at them. I hand the scissors to Sarah. “This doesn’t tell us who the laughing kids are, but it looks as if Rob Turtle framed us all.” “He said he lost his gym bag the other day,” Sarah replies, “in the Hollow.” “He also said that this would be the best April Fool’s Day ever,” I say. “What do we do now? If we give the bag to Principal Taylor, he’ll think we’re trying to make Rob look bad,” Sarah says. “Let’s leave it in the cafeteria,” I suggest. “Someone will turn it in to the lost and found.”
We leave the bag in the stinky cafeteria and return to class. After lunch, Rob Turtle is called to the office, and as the day progresses, more students are found with evidence of pranks. Someone put dirt in the coffee in the teacher’s lounge and made all the lights flicker in the east wing.
At the end of the day, Principal Taylor has corralled a surprising number of students into clean-up duty. Rob, Sarah, and I are assigned to the cafeteria. “How did you arrange all these pranks?” I ask Rob. “You must have been in school all night.” “I didn’t, and I don’t know where the stuff came from. I accidentally left my bag in the Hollow a few days ago,” he replies. “I had some pretty amazing pranks planned, though.” Sarah and I share a look—neither of us believe him, but it’s also true that he couldn’t have done this alone.

" He started skipping the afternoon activities to practice. At night, he rode Gizmo in his dreams.
That didn’t stop his nerves, of course. The morning of the cattle drive, he noticed all the sharp cacti, the rocks that could trip Gizmo. “Ready, bud?” asked Mitch. “You bet,” Zach replied, squaring his shoulders—and then they were off. At first, all Zach could think was back straight, knees up, eyes ahead. All around him rode the ranch hands and other guests. Plenty of them were also beginners. Zach and Gizmo trotted confidently through the scrub. They weren’t galloping, but they were keeping pace! When they reached the herd, the cattle seemed unsure where to go, just like the guests. Zach glanced at his mom. How did a cattle drive work, exactly? The cowboys knew. Mitch and the other ranch hands surrounded the herd and began pushing them toward fresh grazing land. The guests caught on quickly, though cowboying turned out to be hot, sweaty, dirty work. It was challenging, keeping track of the cattle and Gizmo at the same time.
Still, Zach had never had so much fun. That night, at the campfire, he collapsed beside his mom and crowed, “Best day ever!” “You were great out there,” she said, smiling proudly. “Do you want to see?” She dug into her pocket, and out came the last item Zach expected—his phone. Photo after photo showed Zach and his horse, the land, and the cattle. But the photos were stealing Zach away from the here and now. Beneath the starlit sky, the ranch hands sang cowboy songs. Zach turned and popped a marshmallow into his mouth.“Thanks, Mom,” he said. “But you know what? Right now, I don’t want to be anywhere but here.”",622.0
" “Nice landing,” Morty said confidently. “Thanks for the ride!” The pilot grinned. “My pleasure. Thank you for flying with us. Is this your first time?” Morty had wanted her to think he was a frequent flyer who knew a good landing from a bad one. “Yes,” he admitted, “I came along to help my Grandma.” “Looks like you’re doing a fine job,” the pilot said as she turned to the flight attendant. “Do we have wings for this flight escort?” “Yes, Captain,” she said and presented Morty with his very own gold wings. “Thanks!” Morty dropped Grandma’s hand to pin the wings on his jacket.
“Would you like to peek inside the cockpit?” the pilot asked as she stepped aside. “ Wow! ” Morty squeaked. There were knobs, buttons, gauges, dials, levers, and colorful indicator lights everywhere he looked. “You have to be really smart to fly a plane. It isn’t like Mega Mouse at all.” The pilot laughed. “Mega Mouse only flies himself,” she said. “I have to safely transport 168 passengers.”
Morty told Grandma what he had seen in the cockpit as they walked through the bustling San Jose airport. He guided her paw so she could feel his wings. He remembered Dad telling him, “Just follow the Baggage Claim signs.” Morty was searching for their suitcases on the moving belt when he heard scampering behind him. His uncle caught him in a big hug while Grandma embraced his aunt, tears of happiness in her eyes.
“How was your trip?” his uncle asked. “Great!” Morty said. “What’s this?” his uncle wondered, squinting at Morty’s new pin. “Your first time flying, and you already earned your wings?” Morty smiled from ear to ear and threw his paws in the air. “I am Captain Morty Mouse, commander of the skies!”",567.0

Erik looked down, astonished to find he was holding a tiny version of the clock tower. It chimed just like the real one.
The next morning, they rode a red double-decker bus around the city, taking photos from the top. Then they had to catch their flight home. Erik couldn’t believe their trip was already at an end. “Once you’ve been bitten by the travel bug, there’s no going back,” Aunt Isa warned as they unpacked Erik’s suitcase together late that night. “So, next time my mom has to work, can we take another trip? Can Sasha come?” Erik asked. Before Aunt Isa could answer, the front door slammed. “Mom!” Erik shouted and ran downstairs. “Hey, buddy!” His mom gave Erik a hug. “What did you and Aunt Isa get up to this weekend?”
“You won’t even believe me,” Erik began, launching into the story of their trip. Just as he finished, Aunt Isa came rushing downstairs. “I’ve got to go!” she exclaimed, hugging them both. “Thanks for looking after Erik. Sounds like you had quite the adventure!” Erik’s mom said with a wink. “Anytime!” Aunt Isa said. She hurried out the door. “Don’t you believe me?” Erik said, but his mom was already walking down the hall. “It seems you had a wonderful time, whatever you two were doing,” she said as she closed the bathroom door.

Now or “Arthur, you must become king,” he said. “It is the only way.” “And face men like you, who will always chase glory and steal and lie to achieve their ends?” “I was wrong. I let the power of Excalibur eclipse my judgment. You are the true king.” Miguel said. “It is your special gift of leadership that this country deserves.”
“I will not govern alone,” Arthur stated. “I need men around me who are willing to be patient, tell me when I am being unfair, and forgive me when I choose the easy path over the righteous one.” Arthur placed his hand on Miguel’s shoulder, as Miguel kneeled before him, placing Excalibur in his hands. “All hail King Arthur!” Merlin stood behind them. “To King Arthur!” He raised his staff.

At the batting cages, Trevon stood tall with a wide stance. His fan club was nowhere in sight. Miguel watched and waited. Trevon swung at his last pitch, missed, and then turned and saw Miguel. “I’m sorry,” said Miguel. “What for?” asked Trevon, kicking the end of his bat with the toe of his shoe. “I was the jerk. And I needed to be told I was being a jerk.” “I’m sorry I let my jealousy keep me from being happy about what a great hitter you are.” “I’m sorry too,” Trevon said. “Apology accepted,” said Miguel. “Yeah,” said Trevon. “You want to take some practice swings?

" One day, he and a group of soldiers got on an army bus. The bus was segregated. White soldiers sat in the front and black soldiers in the back. Yet Robinson knew he was as good a soldier as the white men. He would not move to the back when he was told to. Robinson was arrested, but he had only stood up for what was right. He was let go.
You’re Hired!
After his time in the army, Robinson played baseball. In 1945, however, baseball was segregated, too. White and black athletes played in separate leagues.
Robinson felt that there should not be separate baseball leagues based on skin color. So did Branch Rickey, the man who ran the Brooklyn Dodgers. Rickey wanted the Dodgers to be the first white team to include a black player. Rickey knew that this player would not only have to be a great athlete. He would also have to face prejudice because he was African American.
Rickey hired Robinson. He had one condition, though. Robinson could only fight prejudice one way—by playing great baseball.
Wearing number 42, Robinson took the field on April 15, 1947. A crowd of twenty-six thousand people watched as he walked to the plate. Insults rang out from the other team’s dugout, but Robinson just played ball.
Equal rights won that day. So did the Dodgers. As for Robinson, he went on to have a great career.
In 1962, he became the first African American to get into the Baseball Hall of Fame.
After Robinson stopped playing baseball in 1957, he went into business. He also continued to work for equal rights for all people. He died in 1972. Today in the United States, more people of color play in the world of sports than ever before. We all have Number 42 to thank for that.",661.0

He didn’t give up, though. Instead, he went to college in Iowa. There, George learned all about farming. He was the first black student to finish and to become a professor at his college.
In 1896, Carver went to Alabama to help the poor farmers there. These farmers had a big problem. Their cotton crops were smaller every year, so the farmers had less and less money.
Carver knew that growing the same crop again and again had worn out the soil. He taught the farmers to add dead leaves and plants to the soil to help it. He also taught them to plant sweet potatoes, peas, or peanuts. These crops put things back into the soil that plants need to grow well.
Farmers needed a way to sell these new crops. Carver invented more than a hundred ways to use sweet potatoes and three hundred ways to use peanuts! New uses meant new products. New products meant new items for farmers to sell.
In 1921, Carver was asked to speak for ten minutes before the U.S. Congress—the country’s lawmakers. Some of them didn’t want him to speak because he was black. After his ten minutes, however, they asked him to speak more. In the end, Congress passed a law to help U.S. peanut farmers.
Carver became very famous, and crowds gathered to hear him speak. He could have made lots of money, but he thought helping people was more important. He believed ideas should be free and freely given.
George Washington Carver believed that people should treat each other with respect. In time, he won the respect of a whole country. Carver also believed that people should care for the Earth. If they did, Earth would provide what they needed. Now, many years later, we are learning that he was right.",780.0

“As one might expect, a tragedy occurred. Penelope froze in her loving embrace, stiff as a statue. “Oh my, what have I done,” King Midas cried. “My daughter will never speak loving words to me again. She will never wrap her soft arms around me. What ever will I do?”
King Midas worked himself into a frenzied panic. He paced in circles. He dithered and fretted. Then it struck him. He had to return to the wizard and ask for another wish. Hurriedly the king mounted his horse, but before it took two steps it hardened into gold. The troubled king marched double-time to the wizard’s cottage on the edge of his kingdom.
“When he arrived, he rushed to the door and rapped furiously. “Let me in, let me in,” his voice quivered and quaked. “The wizard magically opened his now golden door, and King Midas bolted in. “You must grant me another wish,” the King demanded. “I have made a terrible mistake. Please,” he begged, “turn all that I have touched back to what it was.”
“The only way I can do that is to take away ALL the gold and glitter that surrounds you,” warned the wizard. “Even that which you had before this greedy golden touch overtook you. Only then can the spell be reversed. Do you understand?” “Do what you must, but do it quickly,” urged the king wildly.
With a flick of his wrist, the wizard removed the power that had become the King’s curse. King Midas’s clothes became drab and common. His palace shrank into a humble house. The King lost all that made him wealthy, but gained something far more precious—his daughter. He learned that there was much more to life than glitter and gold.",658.0
" The ears of a cricket are located on its knees. To hear the chirping voice of another cricket, it turns its knees toward the direction of the sound. An ant is as sensitive to smells as a dog. Ants communicate by sending out special smells to each other. One smell tells where to find food, and another smell tells other ants to run away from danger.
An eagle is a very large bird, but it weighs very little. Its bones are hollow to help it fly at high altitudes without tiring. Its bones are so lightweight that its feathers actually weigh more than its bones do. A tiny hummingbird is fast and mobile—moving quickly in many directions. Much like a helicopter, it can fly sideways, or up and down, or even fly backward. The eye of an ostrich is bigger in size than its brain. Its big eyes and tall build help it to see objects far away.
A penguin is a bird that swims and walks with ease, but it can’t fly. The bones in its wings are heavy and solid to help it steer a course in water. But those bones weigh too much for the bird to fly. A flamingo is bright pink because of the pigment, or color, in the food it eats. It has long legs to wade far out in the water to search for food. Would a flamingo be green if it liked to eat leaves? These extreme animals are the rock stars in the animal kingdom—they get noticed everywhere they go. You may already be familiar with some of them, but others you may never have seen or heard of before. As you have learned in this book, extreme animals come in many different sizes and shapes!",691.0

Later, while we were walking on the beach, Gram told me that when crabs get tired of swimming or floating on their shell backs, they will let themselves slowly sink to the bottom of the ocean to eat. On the bottom, the horseshoe crabs eat algae (AL-gee), little soft- shell clams, surf clams, worms, and other small invertebrates (in-VUR-tuh-brets).
Because they grind food with their spiny leg segments, these crabs have to be walking to chew their food! Scientists study horseshoe crabs to learn more about their nine eyes and nervous systems. Also, limulus blood can be used to test for some human diseases and to test new drugs. Gram said that horseshoe crabs have been around for 350 million years—since dinosaurs roamed the Earth.
Gram gave me a job. Every morning I ran to the beach to save as many horseshoe crabs as I could. I would turn them over. Then I’d pick up the crabs and toss them into the waves. Sometimes I’d toss them into the waves from the end of the jetty and wish them “good luck” as they floated away. I also tried to chase birds away when I saw them eating the eggs. But Gram told me I should leave the birds alone because they needed food to eat on their flight back north.
One morning I walked to the beach and there were no horseshoe crabs! I ran back to the house to ask what had happened. Gram said that their time for laying eggs was finished until next year. Gram said that next year I could come back and be there to save them again! I walked back to the beach and lay down on the warm, damp sand. My summer vacation had just begun.

" This is how Hawaii’s islands formed. Two of the world’s most amazing volcanoes are found in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park.
One volcano is among the most active volcanoes on Earth. Scientists think it began forming between 300,000 and 600,000 years ago. It finally formed as an island 50,000 to 100,000 years ago.
In 1790, dozens of people were killed when it erupted. Then, in 1924, more eruptions threw huge rocks around the area.
Nearby is another volcano that is one of the biggest mountains on Earth. It covers half the island of Hawaii. This volcano has erupted many times since 1843.
In 1868, an eruption caused earthquakes that lasted four days and destroyed nearly forty buildings.
People have been visiting the volcanoes for hundreds of years.
They wanted to protect both the volcanoes and the land around them. The area was named a national park in 1916.
Hawaii Volcanoes National Park is 520 square miles (1,347 sq km). It has volcanoes and lava tubes that flow to the sea. Lava tubes are big tunnels in the ground. They are so big that people can walk through them.
Hundreds of protected animals live in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. The park is home to turtles, bats, insects, and many types of birds.
The park also has many protected plants and trees. Almost all of its plants are found only in Hawaii. Many plants have lived in and around the volcanoes for years.
Enjoy—But Watch Your Step!
Hawaii Volcanoes National Park is a wonderful place to visit. Drive along a volcano or hike more than 150 miles (241 km) of trails. Bike along the volcano’s paths or camp in the rainforest. It’s almost impossible to know when a volcano will erupt. However, when eruptions are possible, parts of the park close. This special park is never quiet for long.",710.0

Scottish people hold torches and swing long poles with flames to celebrate the New Year. Another Scottish tradition is called first-footing. The first visitor to a home in the New Year must be a male with dark hair. He brings gifts of coal, bread, and a drink.
In the Philippines, round objects stand for coins and good luck. Filipino people celebrate the New Year by wearing clothes with polka dots and eating twelve different types of round fruit. Filipino people also clean their homes before New Year’s Eve. At midnight, they open their windows to invite good luck in.
In parts of Southeast Asia, people celebrate the New Year in late March or mid-April. This is the end of the dry season. It’s a very hot and dusty time of year—a time for water festivals! To prepare for the New Year, people clean dusty statues of Buddha with water. They save the water for priests to pour onto their shoulders for good luck.
The New Year happens at a different time every year in some cultures. The Islamic New Year is based on a lunar calendar. This means it follows the cycles of the Moon. The 365-day calendar is based on the movement of Earth around the Sun. The Chinese and Jewish New Years are based on both calendars.

Morty’s face flushed red. “I made a lousy choice,” he said. “I’m so sorry. I’ll get the money from Dad today and pay you back.”“You won’t be getting a loan from your father anymore,” Mother said. “I’ll discuss the consequences of your actions with him later. You may not get to see your friends for a while.”Morty felt helpless. Mud and wheelies weren’t important anymore—just earning back his mother’s trust.

“Well, how much did he give you for it?” Grandpa asked. “Two hundred fifty dollars.” Morty’s voice was a feeble squeak. Grandpa clicked his tongue. “Looks like you took a wooden nickel,” he said. Morty didn’t know what that meant. Was it too much or too little? he wondered. “Dad, what do you think the collection is worth?” Father asked. “At least fifteen hundred by my estimate. Many of those coins are extremely rare,” Grandpa replied, leaning back in his chair. “I guess that means I made a pretty bad deal,” Morty said as his face flushed.
“My friend knows what that collection means to me,” Grandpa said. “He intended to sell it back to me for what he paid. I’m lucky he was the one who purchased it—anyone else and my years of hard work would be gone.” Morty was ashamed that he hadn’t seen the value of those nickels. Most of all, though, he was ashamed that he had betrayed Grandpa. “I can’t return the board for full price, but I’ll sell it,” Morty said, tears rolling down his cheeks. “I’ll mow lawns and wash cars until I get the money I need to pay you back.” “I would like the money back,” Grandpa replied. “And I’d like to keep the collection until you’re older.”
Morty understood. “I’m sorry, Grandpa,” he sniffled. “I made a huge mistake.” He rose from his seat and wrapped Grandpa in a hug. “That’s all right, Morty,” Grandpa said. “We all make mistakes.” “The nickels will always be special to me because they are special to you,” Morty said. “When you’re ready to trust me with them again, I’ll treasure them forever.” Grandpa patted Morty’s back. “Or until your grandson comes along,” he said with a wink.",551.0
"” “I’ll have to look around outside, in the dark, I guess,” I say, unzipping the tent flap. Sarah whimpers as I step out into the darkness. The clouds have already started to part, exposing a bright Moon. I stand outside the tent for a minute as my eyes adjust to the darkness.
My shoes make little sucking and squishing noises as I walk. Behind me, Sarah’s flashlight beam bounces around the campsite as she climbs from the tent. I turn around to help Sarah just as her light flashes across something in the tree overhead. “Sarah, shine the flashlight up there,” I whisper, pointing above our tent. The bright beam reveals an old-looking lantern suspended from the branch. It wasn’t there when we arrived at the campsite. Without a word, Sarah hands me the flashlight, scrambles up the tree, and grabs the lantern. She starts to climb down and stops.
“Qynn, look,” she says, jabbing her finger at the tent. I raise the light and shine it on the top of our tent. It’s covered in small, streaked, muddy handprints, as if children were pawing at our tent or trying to climb on top of it.
Sarah climbs down the tree, and we inspect our find. It’s a very old oil lantern with thick glass on the sides, but it sloshes as though still filled with fuel.
“I want to go home,” Sarah whines. “Morning isn’t far away,” I say, trying to calm her as much as myself. “Let’s play some Go Fish until the Sun comes up.” Sarah gives me a sad nod, and we climb into the tent. Just as I’m zipping up the flap, I think I see the figure of a child standing in the shallow water near the shore.",722.0
"” Elias and Ada thought about it. “What if we could raise the money to bring P.E. back?” asked Ada suddenly. “Could we have our free time at recess back if we brought back P.E.?”
“I think so,” said Ms. King slowly, “but that won’t be easy. You won’t raise the money for a P.E program with just a bake sale or a car wash.” “We need to reach more people,” said Elias. “Wait a second! I just saw something the other day that might work for us. It was an app you can use to raise money online. We can set a funding goal, and people can give whatever they want from their phones or computers.” “We can certainly try it,” Ms. King said. For the rest of that week, Elias and Ada worked with Ms. King to set up a fund-raiser online. On Friday, the fund-raiser went up, and they sat back to wait and hope. Over the weekend, they watched as their fund-raiser link was shared, and shared, and shared again throughout their town.
On Monday morning before the start of school, Elias and Ada raced into the principal’s office with some news. The owner of a local sporting goods store had called Elias personally. He wanted to give money to fund the school’s P.E. program for the next five years. Ms. King sat back in her chair and looked from one to the other. “Well done, you two,” she said quietly. Elias and Ada grinned at each other and did a high-five. Ms. King stood up and shook their hands. “I’ll be in touch with Mr. Pope at the sporting goods store,” she told them. “Meanwhile, I just heard the bell for recess. Don’t you two have a game of chess to catch up on?”",629.0
" Her mother gave her a belated welcome home hug, and headed into the kitchen. Angie stayed in the living room listening to cooking sounds. It seemed to be stir-fry. Angie’s disappointment began to evaporate like her daydream and was carried out the kitchen window with the smell of bell peppers.
Angie looked over at the book beside her. She picked it up and found the word dream. There were at least fifteen words in the entry, all of them slightly different but somehow the same. She found words that led her to more words that led her to new words that sounded mysterious, incredible, and sometimes rather funny. When her mother called her to dinner, Angie forgot to put the book down before she began to eat.
That night, Angie had a dream. First, she was in the forest with millions of small dinosaurs. Then, the forest became the hill on the playground at school. The dinosaurs stood as if they were waiting. Angie’s favorite green notebook and pencil appeared in her hand. She began to write about the dinosaurs, and they waited patiently as she found just the right words to tell their story. She found everything she needed—in the thesaurus.
On Friday, Mrs. Ellis asked the students to take out their thesauruses. Angie was ready, and this time, she wasn’t daydreaming. Everyone in the class was to write a story about anything in the world. They were supposed to use the thesaurus for at least three words. When the bell rang, Angie handed in her story. Mrs. Ellis whistled as she read the title. The Ponderous Brute, it said. The drawing under the title showed a chubby dinosaur, and Mrs. Ellis grinned. She knew she was in for a treat.",815.0
" Let’s get started.” Morty nodded and had begun to follow Mother when Father spoke up. “Young mouse, you are grounded for a month. You should have plenty of time after clean-up to write apology notes to each of the guests.”
While he carefully dried the dishes, Morty noticed his mother looking at him. “I was so proud of you for helping me,” Mother said. “I am hurt and disappointed that your only intent was to ruin the party.” “I am really sorry,” Morty muttered. “I didn’t think my actions through. I didn’t want to hurt you or make anyone sick. I’m so sorry.” He reached out to give Mother a big hug.
Much later in the afternoon, Morty sat at his desk with a blank notebook of paper in front of him and many apology notes to write. He was trying to work out what to write when he had a brilliant idea. Morty’s grandparents had sent him some money for his birthday. Add that to his earnings from the lemonade stand he ran with Ben and Fred last week, and he might have enough for a small party.
He wrote to each guest in his best penmanship: Dear Mr. and Mrs. Mousier, I would like to apologize for the disgusting food I created for my parents’ party last Saturday. Please do not let it reflect on my mother, who happens to be a great cook. Please give me the chance to make it up to you and to my parents. Morty Mouse invites you to attend a Surprise Barbeque Party for his parents on Saturday, March 1, at 5 p.m. in the backyard at 55 Mousepoint Lane. Please do not tell my parents about the surprise, and bring your little mice along. See you soon, Morty.",848.0
" “I really hurt her.” “She will forgive you, Morty. So will everyone else,” Mother said as she kissed Morty’s head right between his ears. Morty was determined to right his wrongs. He understood what he needed to do.
The following day at school, Morty apologized to Fred, Ben, and Margie; then he promised Miss Snickerwhisker that his conduct would improve. At recess, Morty played soccer, but he wasn’t doing his best. The more goals he missed, the angrier he became. Then Morty remembered what Mother advised, took a water break, and paused to consider what was bothering him. I’m not playing very well, he thought. I’m a bit embarrassed. Maybe I should just tell them how I’m feeling.
Morty scurried back onto the field and huddled with his teammates. “I’m having a lousy game,” he said sheepishly. “We all have our moments—I’ll just have to play twice as good,” Fred said with a wink. “Try four times,” Morty added, and they all laughed. After the huddle, Morty didn’t feel embarrassed anymore. He didn’t succeed in scoring even one goal, but he had an awesome time with his friends. When he returned home, he gave Mary a giant hug and explained how sorry he felt. Morty joined her in her favorite activity—playing dolls—and even contributed his superhero action figures.
That evening when Morty was in bed waiting to be tucked in, he examined Mega Mouse flying through the atmosphere. Do superheroes get angry, too? He wondered. Mother interrupted his thought with a peck on his cheek. “Mom,” Morty held her soft paw. “You were right. It helps to stop and focus on why I’m getting mad.” She smiled and squeezed Morty’s paw. “It isn’t always smooth sailing, but you’re shaping up to be a strong mouse, Mega Morty.”",667.0
" “Now we round up the stragglers ! That’s the best part.”
Zach caught on quickly. Whenever a lazy steer or distracted cow wandered off, he, Mitch, and his mom worked together to push it back into the herd. Cowboying turned out to be hot, sweaty, dirty work. It was challenging, keeping track of the cattle and Gizmo at the same time. Zach choked on a lot of dust, and his legs ached by the end of the day. Still, he’d never had so much fun.
That night, nothing could dim Zach’s smile, though he was so sore that it hurt to walk. At the evening campfire, he collapsed beside his mom and crowed, “Best day ever!” “You were awesome out there,” she said, smiling proudly. “Do you want to see?” She rummaged in her pocket, and out came the last item Zach expected—his phone. With a quick swipe, his mom opened his photos. There was the cattle drive, in vivid detail: Zach and Gizmo trotting off toward the horizon; the two of them creeping up on a wayward steer; Zach dismounting, covered in dust. Looking through the pictures, Zach was whisked back to the incredible sensation of riding through the open desert, just the land and the sky and him and his horse.
“Oh man, wait until my friends see these!” Zach exclaimed. But the words gave him pause. The photos would make for great memories, but they were stealing him away from the here and now: his achy legs, the toasting marshmallows, the starlit sky, and the ranch hands crooning cowboy songs. Across the fire, Mitch shot him a wink.“Thanks, Mom,” Zach said and popped a marshmallow into his mouth. “But you know what? Right now, I don’t want to be anywhere but here.”",791.0
" He couldn’t help laughing. “It’s just raspberry jam, Mum.”
“Reginald.” Reggie felt a gentle shake on his shoulder. He opened his eyes, saw the white tile walls of the hospital, and remembered he’d fallen asleep on a bench in the hallway. His mum sat before him in a wheelchair. The white cast on her leg jutted out like a battering ram. Her face and hands were freckled with nicks and cuts. Reggie sat up. He gently rubbed his eyes with his bandaged hands. “There’s someone here to see us,” she said softly. Only then did Reggie notice the man standing behind her in the gray RAF uniform. Reggie blinked. “Lieutenant Warren?” Lieutenant Warren gave a quick salute with his right hand. His left was in a sling. He pulled Reggie’s letter from a pocket. “Sorry for the delay. Caught some flak before I could write you.” “Dad?” Reggie asked, a lump forming in his throat. Lieutenant Warren sat down beside him, and Reggie’s heart dropped. That’s what people did before delivering bad news.
“He took ground fire and went down, bellied into a field in France. I made another pass overhead, and he signaled that he was okay. But there was nothing I could do with the Germans on my tail.” “So they got him? He’s a POW?” Reggie asked frantically. Warren shook his head and smiled. “French Resistance got to him first. They sneaked him onto one of our subs two nights ago. He’ll be here this afternoon.” Reggie buried his face in his hands, tears of relief welling in his eyes. His mum reached out and squeezed his shoulder. Reggie looked up. “Lucky Duck?” he said, drying his eyes on his shirtsleeve. A smile cracked across Lieutenant Warren’s weathered face. “Luckier than ever, I should say.”",564.0
" During this difficult time, he found comfort in his religion. He later wrote that a dream told him to escape on a ship. When he did, he returned to his family in Britain.
His writings say he had another dream in Britain. The dream told him to return to Ireland to help the Irish people. Maewyn later began many years of training and became a priest and then a bishop. He was given the Latin name Patricius, or Patrick.
Patrick finally returned to Ireland. He set up schools and churches. He helped people in need and became well known. Many people in Ireland became Catholic because of Patrick.
Many tales come from Patrick’s time in Ireland. One says that he chased all the snakes from the island. This tale could not be true. Ireland had no snakes during that time.
Patrick died on March 17, around the year 460. Many years later, the Catholic Church made him the patron saint of Ireland.
The day Saint Patrick died started out as a feast day in Ireland. Over hundreds of years, many Irish people moved to other countries. They brought their customs, including Saint Patrick’s Day, with them.
Towns and cities all over the world have Saint Patrick’s Day celebrations. Along with parades and Irish food, many people wear green.
Green is on Ireland’s flag. Some people believe wearing green brings good luck.
The shamrock is a symbol of Ireland. Many people believe it is a kind of clover. Some believe it may be a different plant. The shamrock is a common decoration on Saint Patrick’s Day.
Saint Patrick was a real person who is important to Ireland’s history. The holiday that bears his name has changed over the years. It has become a celebration for people around the world. On Saint Patrick’s Day, everyone can be a little Irish.",581.0
"
All spiders are meat eaters. They bite insects and inject venom through their fangs. The venom turns the insect’s body to liquid. Then the spider sucks up its meal.
One of the most unusual things about spiders is the webs they build. Spiders are born knowing how to build webs. They use sticky silk threads to trap insects. They walk on silk threads that are not sticky. The silk comes from special parts on the spider’s back end called spinnerets.
Webs come in many beautiful shapes. Circular webs catch flying insects. Webs on the ground are made to catch crawling insects. Once an insect is caught, the spider wraps it in silk. The silk traps the insect so it cannot get away.
Some spiders build silk funnels or tunnels. When an insect crawls in the tunnel, the spider attacks. It traps the insect with its legs and bites the insect with its strong fangs.
Spiders also travel on their silk. They lower themselves down from high places. From a leaf or twig, spiders can toss a sticky silk thread into the air. When the thread catches on another twig or leaf, the spider can walk across. Some baby spiders make silk parachutes to travel. A parachute can carry a baby spider on the wind for over a hundred kilometers (62 mi).
Some spiders do not spin webs. The spitting spider spits sticky stuff onto insects. The insect cannot get away, and the spider bites it. Jumping spiders can jump far to land on the insects they eat.
Trapdoor spiders build holes in the ground with silk trap doors over them. The spider springs up out of the door when an insect walks by. Tarantulas also spring out of holes. Some tarantulas are so big that they can catch birds and lizards.",619.0
" Toyota, the first foreign company to do so, sold more cars and trucks than any other company in the world. Toyotas are not the only cars made outside the United States. Volkswagen and BMW are imported from Germany. But the countries of Japan and South Korea have brought the highest numbers of cars into the United States.
Automobiles are helpful, but they can also cause serious problems for people. Exhaust (burning gases from a car’s tailpipe) gets in the air. That means unhealthy chemicals get in the air that we breathe. These chemicals can make people sick. Every year, car companies try to reduce the amount of chemicals their cars make. Have you ever been in a traffic jam? All the cars on the road just sat still, and you couldn’t go anywhere. So many cars are on the road today that it causes problems. Remember—there are about 200 million cars in the United States. That’s almost as many cars as people. In fact, the number of cars has grown faster than the number of people.
Years ago, most cars were unsafe in accidents. Today, special car parts help to protect people. Cars have seat belts. Babies and small children ride in safety seats. Newer cars have big airbags that inflate—fill with air—in accidents. What do you think would make cars even safer? Car companies are also working on new kinds of engines. One type of car, called a hybrid, uses both a gas engine and an electric motor. Hybrids use less gas. This might cut down on the unhealthy chemicals in the air.
We will always be a nation that travels from one place to another. But will it always be on wheels? How will cars look in the future? How will they work? Perhaps your ideas will shape the future.",735.0
"” “Of course you could, Leticia,” Mrs. Thomas smiled. “This is completely your project. Remember, we’re just your helpers.” “Right,” Tyrone agreed, “you’re the boss!” Leticia definitely liked the sound of that.
Leticia spent the evening in her room constructing little blank books and then writing in each of the books. She was careful to use her best handwriting, and she had to write very small. After a while, she shared the work in progress with her mother and brother. They were impressed by her idea to write in the books. “Cool,” Tyrone confirmed. “Yes,” her mother agreed, “this undoubtedly looks creative.” Her mother and brother then helped her complete the assignment.
On the 100th day, everyone brought their projects to school. Leticia put hers up with the others’ in her class. At the top, she wrote 100 Reasons I Love to Come to School. The title made her classmates curious, and they began to read the messages inside the tiny books.
“Kate, this one’s about you,” Mia squeaked. “It says, ‘I like to see Kate smile.’” “This book’s about George,” Kevin joined in. “It says, ‘George is always nice to people.’” Soon a crowd formed around Leticia’s project. Finally, their teacher decided to read the little books to the whole class. It took a long time, considering there were 100 books, yet after each book, the entire class clapped for the person the book was about.
There were books for every student in Leticia’s grade and every teacher at the school. There was a book for the custodians, school bus drivers, principal, librarians, and the cafeteria workers, too. Leticia successfully found a creative way to celebrate the 100th day of school. Her 100 reasons why she liked going to school informed 100 people why they were special.",851.0
" It happens when people first feel sleepy and start to doze.
During stage 2 NREM, muscles don’t move much. Sleepers can no longer tell what is going on around them. This is the part of sleep when memories start to be made. Half or more than half of all sleep time is spent in stage 2 NREM sleep.During stage 3 NREM, sleepers begin to dream. The brain continues to store memories. It is usually very hard to wake someone from this deep sleep. This stage lasts for nearly a quarter of sleep time.
REM sleep is different from the other stages of sleep. During REM sleep, the sleeper’s closed eyes move quickly from side to side. It’s as if he or she is watching a ping-pong match. Yet the sleeper’s body is completely still. Muscles are frozen in place during REM sleep. Perhaps that is because people tend to have wild dreams then.
Many things should happen when our tired head hits the pillow. When they don’t, we can have problems during the day.Too little sleep can make us cranky and cause us to make more mistakes. We may have a hard time solving problems. Our bodies struggle, too. Wounds take longer to heal. We might feel too hot or too cold.
It is very important to have good sleep habits. Try to go to bed and wake up at the same time each day. This helps keep your body on schedule. You should also limit your screen time. Try not to watch television or use a computer, tablet, or smartphone right before bedtime. Also limit your activity before going to bed. Going for a walk is fine, but avoid a lot of exercise.Good sleep habits keep the body healthy and the mind sharp. Remember, if you don’t snooze, you just might lose!",572.0
" All eyes were on Morty as he inched up the rope at a snail’s Morty’s tail was barely off the ground when his paws began to slip. His knees shook with fear. He listened for the insults he deserved, but they didn’t come. “Don’t give up, Morty!” It was Marta’s sweet voice. “Keep your eye on the goal, and put one paw ahead of the other!” The others joined in, crying out, “Come on, Morty! You’ve got it!”
In that moment, Morty knew that these mice were very good sports, and that he was not. They were rooting for him even though he didn’t help them train. Morty also knew that he wasn’t going to make it to the top. Tears filled his eyes as he stared down at the blurry sea of mice. He loosened his grip and dropped to the mat. Coach Mack was the first to his side. “Are you injured?” he asked. Morty blushed and shook his head; the only thing hurt was his pride. “I guess I’m only a once-fit mouse,” he said. The other mice brushed over his failure. “Nice effort, Morty!” they shouted.
Morty wanted to hide, but he knew he had to make up for his arrogance. He approached Marta. “I’m sorry for the way I acted,” he admitted. “It was mean of me to make fun of you, and then you cheered me on anyway.” “It’s okay, Morty. You can help me get better at soccer to make up for it,” Marta said with a smile. Morty laughed. “Deal,” he agreed. Morty watched Marta and the others try to master the rope climb.

And now that everyone thinks I’m dead, I can start over fresh.” “Things will work out if you let them know you’re safe,” Miguel said. “You’ll have many adventures—believe me.” Tom looked up at the stars. “And grownups can help you out in scary times,” Miguel whispered. “Don’t be afraid to ask when you need it.” “You’ve gone soft, Huck.” Tom pulled his bandanna low over his eyes to sleep. Miguel curled up, too, wondering if Tom would slip out that night to visit his family, like in the story. A coyote howled, and Miguel opened his eyes in the darkness just before dawn.

" Safe travel is nearly impossible during a whiteout.
Blowing winds also create something called wind chill. Wind chill causes the body to lose heat faster. Skin feels like it is in air that is much colder. Wind chill can cause bare skin to freeze.
Blizzards begin as snowstorms. A layer of moist warm air meets cold air. Clouds form, and the water in them freezes into flakes. The flakes fall from the sky as snow.
Blizzards can happen anywhere there is snow. There is a greater chance of them happening in some places than others. The East Coast of the United States is one such place. Storms called nor’easters often hit this area. A nor’easter can last for several days and brings lots of snow.
Sometimes a snowstorm begins in western Canada. It then travels quickly across the American plains, and heads east. This type of storm is called an Alberta Clipper. Clippers don’t bring a lot of snow. They are known instead for their strong winds and biting cold. Many of North America’s blizzards start out as snowstorms that are nor’easters or Alberta Clippers.
The mix of wind, snow, and cold makes blizzards dangerous. Years ago, blizzards caught people by surprise. Today, it is easier to know when and where blizzards will strike next.
This gives people time to prepare. They can make sure they have batteries and flashlights in case of a power loss. Families can make sure they have enough food and water to last for several days. They can hurry home before the snow starts.
Once they are prepared, people should settle in and wait out the storm. The best place to be in a blizzard is inside. In time, the storm will end. Then it will be safe to have fun in the snow it left behind!",643.0
" Religion is important in Morocco, and almost all of the people are Muslim. People mainly speak Arabic and Berber.
Morocco has many snowy mountains. It also has forests, streams, and even waterfalls on its lands. It is home to part of the Sahara Desert as well. In the desert, few plants live except those that grow near an oasis.
The weather along the coast is mild. However, in other areas it gets quite hot in the summer and quite cold in the winter.
A Muslim king founded Morocco more than twelve hundred years ago. In the 1800s, Spain and France took control of it. Morocco became a free country once again in 1956. Today, Morocco has a king and a prime minister.
There are interesting animals in Morocco. Many kinds of birds live there. Ducks, storks, and other birds travel to Morocco in the winter. Camels, though, are the most famous animals in the country. Visitors can take camel rides through Morocco.
Morocco also has a kind of monkey called the Barbary macaque (muh- KAK). The Barbary macaque lives in the forests. Foxes live in the desert. They are the smallest foxes on earth. They sleep during the day and are active at night.
Many people from around the world love the food of Morocco. People in Morocco often eat a tiny round pasta called couscous. They also eat most kinds of meat. One dish is a flaky crust filled with meat. It is topped with sugar. Some people in Morocco like to drink a sweet mint tea with their meals.

" The sun is so bright compared to the dark underground. But it is wonderful! They climb out of their burrow and over the mound of dirt at its opening. All around them is short prairie grass and plants.
Danger!
Charlie and his sisters begin to explore. Before long, a prairie dog’s sharp bark cuts through the air. “Yee-ipp!” he shouts with a hop. He has spotted danger! “Yee-ipp!” Charlie’s father replies. All of the prairie dogs stand tall, alert. Even though there is danger, they stay. The dogs will stay very still and watch until the danger goes away.
What might the danger be? Many predators hunt prairie dogs. Predators include coyotes, bobcats, prairie falcons, black-footed ferrets, and golden eagles.
Perhaps the biggest danger of all is humans. Some people think prairie dogs destroy the land. These people try to harm prairie dogs by destroying their homes or killing them. Other people believe prairie dogs are important because their burrows bring air and water to the soil. Burrows also provide hiding places for other animals to escape predators.
Not all yips and barks signal danger. Some yips or barks signal a prairie dog is lonely or upset. Now Charlie hears more yips and barks from the older prairie dogs that signal it is safe. The threat is gone. Charlie and his sisters like playing outside in the sun. They will spend most of their summer outside.
As summer turns to fall, they will prepare their burrow for winter. During winter, they will rarely go out into the harsh weather. Early next spring, the older females will have babies. And in late spring, Charlie will be an adult male. He will share in the watchdog duties. He will probably start a family and build his own coterie.",679.0
" He believed that if people worked together, they could change the unfair laws. He asked other African Americans to stop riding the city buses until the law was changed. Thousands of them stopped using the buses for almost a year.
Some whites agreed that the law was unfair. Other whites liked things the way they were. They were angry that Martin wanted to change things. Someone even threw a bomb at his house. But the city finally changed the law to allow blacks to sit wherever they chose on buses.
“I Have a Dream”
In 1963, Martin helped lead marches to change other laws in the South. Many of the people at one march were children. When police used force to stop the march, some of the children were badly hurt.
Around the country, people saw how African Americans were treated. More and more people wanted to change the laws to be fair to everyone. When Martin led a march in Washington, D.C., more than 250,000 black and white Americans marched with him.
At the march, Martin spoke to a cheering crowd. He shared his dream that one day, the color of a person’s skin wouldn’t matter. All people would be “free at last.” The next year, the United States passed a law ending the separation of blacks and whites.
The work wasn’t over, though. Many blacks were still poor. Their lives were still hard. Martin kept working for better homes, schools, and jobs for them. Then in the spring of 1968, Martin was shot by a white man.
Martin died at age thirty-nine. People around the world felt shocked and sad. Martin Luther King Jr. was a hero who worked to make the world a better place. Today we remember him for helping to make the laws fair for people of every color.",670.0
" Next, they poured a layer of earth inside. Workers packed down the earth. Then, they added more layers and packed them down to form a tall wall.
Later on, builders covered dirt walls with bricks and stone. They formed the bricks in wooden molds. Then, they baked the bricks in ovens. Builders used stone instead of bricks for parts of the wall that needed to be extra strong. Workers filled the spaces between the bricks and stones with mortar. The mortar was very strong because it was mixed with sticky rice!
The Great Wall helped protect Chinese people from their enemies for many years. At first, the enemies were small groups of people who wandered from place to place. Later, walls protected different kingdoms from each other. After China became one country, the wall protected it from enemies to the north.
Building the Great Wall was fast at some times and slow at other times. When China was in control, Chinese rulers built up the wall. At other times, China was ruled by its enemies and building stopped. Sections of the wall fell apart. Later, when China took back control, workers fixed the wall and built new sections. They used bricks and stone to make the wall stronger.
People come to see the Great Wall from all over the world. Most people visit the sections that are close to Beijing. If you go, be prepared to do a lot of walking and climbing. You’ll also want to take many pictures. Be sure to bring a camera!
How Long Is It?
You can’t see the Great Wall from the Moon, but it is still amazing. Imagine lining up all the sections in a row. The wall would stretch from the North Pole to the South Pole. That’s a mighty long wall!",596.0
" “It’s called that because, well—we have a lot of cactus here. Fifteen other teams play in Florida. That league is called the Grapefruit League because they grow a lot of grapefruit there.”
The Mariners shared the training camp with the San Diego Padres. Scotty watched as dozens of players did the same moves over and over again. They tossed balls back and forth and caught grounders. They ran the bases and chased down fly balls. They made their hard work look more like fun. “Look, Gramps!” cried Scotty. “There’s Ichiro Suzuki, just like you said—and he’s hitting off a batting tee! ”
“It helps him keep his swing level,” said a booming voice behind them. Scotty turned to see the Padres’ Hall of Fame great Tony Gwynn watching Suzuki. “You’re Tony Gwynn!” said Scotty. “You’re on my All-Time All-Stars team!” Scotty said. “You got a double yesterday off of Walter Johnson!” “That would have been difficult,” Tony said. “Johnson pitched from 1907 until 1927.”
“I’m here as a batting coach for the Padres,” Tony said. “Show me how you swing a bat.” “I’m hopeless,” said Scotty. “You’re not hopeless,” Tony said. “You just need to work harder on some things.” “To stay balanced, keep your back foot on the ground as you step toward the ball,” he said.
Scotty still missed the tee a few times, but he made some solid hits, too. Tony also showed Scotty how to use two hands when catching the ball. “Reach your arm high when you throw. That’s it.” Tony said. “Try again, and keep practicing.”
On the ride home, Scotty was too tired and too happy to say much except, “Hey, Gramps, I don’t know how you arranged that, but it was cool! Will you help me practice tomorrow?”",534.0

The Statue of Liberty was placed on its pedestal in 1886—ten years late! It was supposed to be given to the United States in 1876. This date was 100 years after the United States declared its independence . People were still happy, though. They held a celebration with music and a parade. President Grover Cleveland even gave a speech.
The statue is more than a work of art. It is a symbol of friendship between two countries. It also stands for the freedom and hope of people who have moved to the United States. A poem on display inside the pedestal includes the famous lines, “Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.”
Certain parts of the statue have special meaning as well. The crown has seven spikes, which stand for the seven seas and continents of the world. The torch in the statue’s right hand is a symbol of freedom. The tablet in the statue’s left hand has the date July 4, 1776 , written on it. This is the date when the Declaration of Independence was signed.
The Statue of Liberty has stood the test of time, though it has needed some repairs. American workers have made the iron skeleton stronger and have added many lights. The statue started out the color of a shiny, new copper penny. The air slowly made it change color. By the 1920s, it had turned green!
Millions of people from all over the world visit the Statue of Liberty each year. They take a ferry to the island, which is now called Liberty Island. They were once able to climb to the torch. Today, however, visitors are only allowed inside the pedestal and crown. People will continue to visit the statue for many years to see this symbol of freedom.",794.0
" But they have become very good at predicting volcanic eruptions. In 1991, scientists warned people in the country of the Philippines that a volcano was about to erupt. Many people left the area and found safety before the huge volcano erupted.
Tsunamis are huge waves caused by earthquakes or volcanoes. Tsunamis can be as high as a football field is long. They are the largest waves in the world.
Large landslides caused by earthquakes or volcanoes sometimes fall into the sea and make huge waves. Earthquakes and volcanoes can also happen on the ocean floor. All of these events can create tsunamis.
Tsunamis speed away from where they begin in all directions. A tsunami can cross an entire ocean. Tsunamis travel very fast. In the open ocean, tsunamis may not be very high above the surface of the water, but they are very deep. As a tsunami comes close to land, the rising ocean floor pushes the wave upward. When a tsunami reaches land, it is tall enough to destroy almost anything in its path.
Most tsunamis are between one and ten stories high. That might not sound very high, but it is hard to imagine the power of this much moving water. Even a small tsunami can destroy houses, streets, and entire towns.
Like volcanoes, tsunamis are becoming easier to predict. Scientists have instruments that detect volcanoes and earthquakes. When a large one happens, scientists often have time to warn people that a tsunami may be coming.
During a large earthquake, the ground shakes, destroying homes and property. In an explosive volcanic eruption, liquid rock, ash, and landslides can cover whole cities. And tsunamis can cause billions of dollars in damage. Scientists are working to be able to predict volcanoes, earthquakes, and tsunamis in order to save thousands of lives.",905.0
"” “Mother’s foo foo is the best! Now you’re making me hungry,” Ruth said. “Come on. Let’s go to the library. We can use the Internet on the computers there to get pictures for your presentation.”
The next day, David brought a large box to school. He told his teacher that he was ready to share about his life in Africa. First, he took out a map of Africa. He showed the other students where his family was from and where they had moved to. He held up pictures showing all the differences between his life in Africa and his life in America. Finally, he pulled out of the box a ball made from plastic bags and string. “What is that thing?” Jacob asked. “And what’s it for?”
David told his classmates how he had played soccer almost every day with this kind of ball. He told them how they didn’t have places to buy real soccer balls. Another student said, “I wish I lived in Zimbabwe. Then I wouldn’t have to go to school. You were so lucky.” David explained, “No, you are all lucky to be in school. At the camp, we got to play soccer, but we didn’t have money to buy new books or games. We could never leave the camp because it wasn’t safe. I am really happy to live here now.” After David’s presentation, the other students applauded, and Mrs. Marquez announced that it was recess time. As David was walking out the door to the playground, he felt a tap on his shoulder. He turned and saw Jacob holding out a shiny soccer ball. “Here,” Jacob offered, “you can have my soccer ball.” “Thanks,” smiled David. “It’s perfect!” “C’mon, let’s play!” called Jacob as he raced out the door.",614.0
" Ellen pretended to be deaf so she could avoid talking and giving herself away.
The Crafts reached Savannah, Georgia, safely and took a steamer ship to South Carolina. There, they ran into trouble. The clerk did not want to sign for the couple’s tickets. Just then, the boat captain from their first ship passed by. He offered to sign for them. They met their final test in Maryland. Slave states that shared borders with free states had border patrols. These patrols checked for escaping slaves. The Maryland border patrol stopped the Crafts and would not let them pass. One officer finally took pity on them. He let the Crafts board. They arrived safely in Pennsylvania on Christmas morning, 1848. There they found friends and shelter.
For a while, life was good for the Crafts. They learned to read and write. They went to live in Boston, Massachusetts. William and Ellen both found jobs. Their good life did not last, however. In 1850, a new law was passed. The law made it a crime to protect escaped slaves. Escaped slaves living in free states were suddenly in danger.
Two bounty hunters arrived in Boston, searching for the Crafts. The Crafts hid with friends, but they grew tired of living in fear. In December 1850, they went to England.
The Crafts settled in London and had five children. They traveled around England and spoke against slavery. In 1860, William wrote a book about their escape. In 1870, William and Ellen returned to America. Slavery was now against the law in the United States. The Crafts settled in Georgia. They started a school to teach and help freed slaves. Later, the Crafts moved to South Carolina. They spent their last years living together in peace and freedom, just as they had always dreamed.",612.0
" • A music video for sale to promote the school tutoring program. • A baby-sitting program for the kids of adults who are going back to school.
The day of the meeting arrived. The members of the KCLT dressed in their most business-like clothes. The club met in the school multi-purpose room. “Are you guys ready?” Brian asked Mandy and Chris. Mandy nodded her head. Brian thought it was the first time he saw Mandy answer without words. Mandy and Chris gave their presentation. The whole club applauded. The students were glad to be included in the decision-making process. The ballots were passed out.
Elizabeth collected the ballots and most of the club stayed to see which project would be voted the favorite. As it turned out, the after-school reading program won by a landslide. “I guess everyone agreed that our school could use the money to buy students more books,” Brian said. “Or maybe they thought the music video wouldn’t sell,” Mandy suggested. “Maybe they thought helping parents needing baby-sitting would be too hard for students to organize,” said Chris.
“Whatever they thought,” Brian said, “we’d better get to work. We have a project. Now we need a good business plan.” But the plan didn’t take long, because Brian had been working on all three plans all along. He sat with the Leaders Team and Ms. Maybry to show them how they might spend the $3,000 to buy books, supplies, and advertising for the program. “Brian,” said Mandy, “you are the financial expert—you should present the plan.” “Thanks, but I get so nervous when I talk to a group,” Brian said. “You and Chris can present to the committee. You two are the talking experts. No question.” And everyone laughed.",676.0
" They raised them to the light and looked into their centers. They thought about the women who had cried for their men, and they felt sad. Then they shut down the computer and held their stones tight. When their mother returned, they told her the legend of the Apache Tears. They took turns speaking, without talking over each other. Mrs. Yates was touched to see how the story had affected her children. “Can you see the tear of an Apache woman?” Paco asked her, as he held his stone up to the light.
Mrs. Yates took the stone and held it up to the light. “I think I do see it,” she said. “It’s a tear for the man she lost, and it’s a tear for the sad children he left behind.” She gave the stone back to Paco, closed his fingers over it, and squeezed his hand lightly. “It’s a tear that says ‘I wish my children were happy.’” Paco and Tala gave each other a long look. They understood that their father was not coming back and that they needed to find a way to live peacefully as a family again.
That night, after talking it over, Paco and Tala gave their stones to their mother. At first, Mrs. Yates wouldn’t take them because the stones seemed to have made her children friends again. In time, Paco and Tala convinced her that they wanted her to have the Apache Tears. Mrs. Yates slept with the stones under her pillow that night. The next day, she went to a jeweler and had the stones made into a necklace. When the necklace was ready, she slipped it on and never took it off again. Apache Tears really had brought them all good luck!",681.0
" It’s an incredible amount of information. “I understand what you’re trying to do, but your threats won’t get me to help you,” Charlotte snapped. There is a threat, but not in the way you’re thinking. I assure you, we pose no danger to humans or Earth. In fact, the opposite is true. We’re trying to save you from yourselves. “I don’t believe you. You’re just trying to brainwash me into betraying my species like all the others. It won’t work. I know what you really are—invaders, conquerors, colonizers.” I see you’ve remembered some of the Resistance’s labels. Your recovery is going well. We should be able to perform the second procedure soon. Charlotte tried to jump off the bed, but her bonds held. She struggled with all her strength, and when they didn’t give, she spit at her captor. Artie simply nodded and left the room.
After the first explosion, the real attack began. Bullets and grenades struck the shields in dazzling blue light. The main force focused its fire on the south side of the tower. A small team of five from the backup force approached the north side. Though they all carried weapons, they didn’t fire. Instead, they snuck up to the tower. Then, one by one, with a flash of blue light, they passed through the shield and onto the grounds. “We can get in there!” Charlotte gasped. Before Sam could reply, she sprinted across the open area. She kept close to the ground, heading toward the point where the soldiers had passed through the shield. She reached the shield at a full run, expecting to pass through it as they had. Instead, she felt a flash of pain and a tingling sensation all over her body. Everything went dark.",660.0
" “But if the courses be departed from, the ends will change. Say it is thus with what you show me.”
The Spirit was immovable as ever. Scrooge crept towards it, trembling as he went; and following the finger, read upon the stone of the neglected grave his own name, “Am I that man who lay upon the bed?” he cried, upon his knees. The finger pointed from the grave to him, and back again. “No, Spirit! Oh no, no!” The finger still was there. “Spirit!” he cried, tight clutching at its robe, “hear me. I am not the man I was. I will not be the man I must have been but for this intercourse. Why show me this, if I am past all hope?” For the first time the hand appeared to shake. “Good Spirit,” he pursued, as down upon the ground he fell before it: “Your nature intercedes for me, and pities me. Assure me that I yet may change these shadows you have shown me, by an altered life.”
The kind hand trembled. “I will honour Christmas in my heart, and try to keep it all the year. I will live in the Past, the Present, and the Future. The Spirits of all Three shall strive within me. I will not shut out the lessons that they teach. Oh, tell me I may sponge away the writing on this stone!” In his agony, he caught the spectral hand. It sought to free itself, but he was strong in his entreaty, and detained it. The Spirit, stronger yet, repulsed him. Holding up his hands in a last prayer to have his fate aye reversed, he saw an alteration in the Phantom’s hood and dress. It shrunk, collapsed, and dwindled down into a bedpost.",683.0
" A magnet will not pull on copper—or on wood, either.
Magnetism flows through a magnet. It goes in one end and out the other. These two ends are the north and south poles. The force flows out the north pole and back in the south pole.
You can use two magnets to feel magnetism. The north pole of one magnet will attract the south pole of the other one. Now, try to push the two north poles together. It isn’t easy! Two north poles will always repel each other. So will two south poles.
Magnets have many modern uses. One credit card can have millions of magnets. These magnets are tiny—no bigger than grains of powder. Each tiny magnet points in its own direction. The different directions of the magnets make a code. Computers read the code. Putting a credit card near a powerful magnet can mess up or erase the code.
Magnets help make, and use, electricity. Almost all the electricity you use comes from machines called generators. Generators make electricity by spinning magnets around coils of wire. The magnetism makes an electric current in the wire.
Electric motors work like generators in reverse. They use electric current and magnets to spin an axle. The axle can be used to turn fans, cutting blades, or wheels. Fans, blenders, and remote-control cars use the power from these moving parts.
Magnets allow some high-speed trains to float above the track. The trains actually fly as they travel. This makes for a fast, smooth ride.
Doctors use a very powerful magnet to look inside a person’s body. It helps doctors see cancer and other kinds of illness without having to cut open the person.
Magnets are fun. They’re also really useful. Every time you watch television or even turn on a light, you are using magnets.",579.0

Some April Fools’ jokes are famous. Spaghetti Trees? In 1957, a British TV show described a spaghetti tree. When the show was over, many people called the station wanting one.
Companies and the media fool people, too. On April 1, 1996, Taco Bell said that it had bought the American Liberty Bell. The company said it would now be called the “Taco Liberty Bell.” Many people believed the story. The company had to say it was a joke. In 1998, Burger King showed an ad for a left-handed burger. They said it made left-handed eating easier.
Internet April Fools’ jokes spread fast. One of Google’s famous jokes was a drink it said made people smarter. In 2012, a radio station said that Twitter was changing to 133 characters per tweet. It was a joke. In 2013, Twitter said it would ask people who used vowels in their tweets to pay more. This, too, was a joke. Even Pokémon Go began as an Internet joke in 2014.

" They finally agreed that sharing was a good thing, so they decided to split the pie with the other two crows.
“How do we cut up the pie now?” asked the first crow. The second crow, being the smarter of the two, suggested dividing each of the halves down the middle. “Cutting each half into two pieces will make four equal slices. Each of us will have one-fourth of the pie,” she said.
“Brilliant idea,” said the first crow, and he cut the two halves in half, making fourths. “There—we’ve got four equal pieces. Now everyone should be happy. Let’s eat!”
But before the first four crows could take even one bite of pie, four more crows sailed down and perched on the ledge beside them. They stared hungrily at the pie. “How about being generous and sharing that lovely pie with some poor, hungry crows?” they pleaded.
There was a bunch of squawking and cawing among the first four crows. But they, too, agreed that sharing was a good thing, and they decided to give a portion of the pie to the four other hungry crows. “Now what are we going to do to make sure everyone gets an equal piece?” asked the first crow.
The second crow declared, “No problem. We just make eight equal pieces by cutting each of the fourths in half. That will mean we each get one-eighth of the pie. That’s the fairest way to do it, and everyone should be happy.”
“Sounds good to us,” shouted all the crows. “Now, let’s hurry and eat our pieces of pie before we have to split them into even smaller fractions.” Each hungry crow gobbled down one-eighth of the pie, and then they all flew off in search of more.",829.0
" Many Indians did as Gandhi asked, but a few were violent. The British blamed Gandhi for the violence and put him in prison for two years.
In India, only British companies could gather and sell salt. The government also placed a large tax on any salt sold. Gandhi thought it was unfair for Indians to pay the British for the salt from Indian lands.
Gandhi and some followers began a 240-mile (386 km) walk across India to the sea. Along the way, Gandhi spoke to many people. When he reached the coast, thousands of Indians were following him. Gandhi went to the shore and picked up some salt from the ground. His followers did the same. Gandhi was arrested, along with more than 60,000 others.
The arrests and treatment of Indians caused anger around the world. Finally, British and Indian leaders began to talk about the British leaving India. Hindus and Muslims had often been in conflict in India. Gandhi believed that the two religions could live in peace. Many Muslims wanted their own country, however.
When the British rule of India ended, the country was split into two countries. Gandhi was very sad about the split. Many Muslim people formed the new country of Pakistan.
Millions of people moved from one country to the other. There was much fighting. Gandhi was able to bring peace to some places. However, even Gandhi could not stop all the fighting.
When Gandhi was on his way to a prayer meeting, a man in the crowd shot him three times. Gandhi’s death saddened people everywhere.

" Instead, Robinson would fight prejudice by playing great baseball.
Jackie Robinson began by playing for the Dodgers’ minor league team. On the road, he could not stay in the same hotels as the rest of the team. Other minor league teams would not play because of Robinson. Pitchers on other teams threw the ball at him. Even some of the men on his own team didn’t want to play with him.
None of this abuse stopped Robinson. He played well enough to move up to the Dodgers the next year. Wearing number 42, he took the field on April 15, 1947, before a crowd of twenty-six thousand people.
The stands were full when Robinson picked up his baseball bat. The crowd watched as he walked to the plate. Insults rang out from the other team’s dugout. The words hurt, but Robinson did not respond. He let his bat do the talking.
The Dodgers earned a victory that day, not only over Boston but also over prejudice. Robinson forced many people who thought less of African Americans to think again.
Robinson went on to have a great career. In 1949, he was voted Most Valuable Player in the league. He was a fast runner who led the league in stolen bases. In 1962, Robinson became the first African American to get into the Baseball Hall of Fame.
After Robinson stopped playing baseball in 1957, he went into business. He became the first black vice president of a U.S. national company. He also became a civil rights leader. He continued to work for equal rights for all people until his death in 1972. Today in the United States, more people of color play in the world of sports than ever before.

" “What letter comes before u in the alphabet?” he said. “T,” Poloma said. “And the letter h comes before i, and the letter e comes before f. This is a substitute-letter cipher, Papa!” “Yes! I remember now! During the Civil War, some Northern spies used a code called the advance cipher. They advanced each letter one letter of the alphabet.”
Once they cracked the code, it was not difficult to read the message. “I know what it says, Papa! It says, ‘Follow the Drinking Gourd.’ But I don’t know what the message means. Do you know what it means?” “The Drinking Gourd is the group of seven stars now called the Big Dipper, which can always be found in the northern sky. Escaping slaves followed the Drinking Gourd from safe house to safe house until they reached their freedom.”

By the time they returned to the other side of the stream, the sun had completely disappeared. Poloma stopped and studied the sky. “Are you looking for the Drinking Gourd?” her grandfather asked. “There it is!” Poloma pointed to a bright shape in the sky. “Shall we follow it?” “It’s your decision. Are we heading north?”
Poloma had to think about that for a minute. The Drinking Gourd would lead them back across the stream, past the boulder with the cipher, on to places north. “We need to go south, Papa.

“Go, go, go!” I shouted, jumping on my bike. I burst into the store and ran to the counter, where Rick, the owner, grinned as though he’d been expecting me. “I’m supposed to say ‘go,’ ” I said. Rick reached under the counter and retrieved a box wrapped in purple paper. “She wouldn’t tell me what it was,” he said, watching eagerly as I unwrapped it. Inside was a wooden board, plain except for a carved grid like graph paper. There was also a bag of black and white pieces shaped like mints. “What is that?” Sol asked.
“That’s Go,” Rick explained, “one of the oldest games in the world. It’s kind of like checkers, because the rules are simple, but kind of like chess, because it takes a lifetime to master.” There was also a card with a website address and the message, “We can play online! <3, Hee Jung.” I followed Sol out of the store, lost in thought about the wide-open possibilities of the new game. “It was pretty cool doing this treasure hunt with you,” he said. “I wouldn’t have found the treasure without your help,” I said. “It’s too bad Hee Jung got you that nice board, but you guys can only play online.” Sol gave me a hesitant smile. “Maybe you could teach me that game, too?” I touched the crisp lines on the board and felt the small, smooth pieces. “Bro,” I said, “you’re on!”",660.0

The door opened up to a large room sunken several feet below them, at the foot of wide wooden stairs. It was the room of their dreams: Huge, overstuffed red velvet couches and chairs were scattered around, chessboards and checkerboards made of polished wood and ivory sat on dark wood tables throughout. A full suit of armor from a medieval knight stood staring at them from the corner. A Siamese cat leaped down off of one of the sofas and began purring. Old maps of Africa and Asia were framed on the walls. Bookshelves lined the room, but these were not like the ordinary bookshelves above in the library. All of these books were leather-bound works from decades ago, names the boys had never heard of. But something about the titles promised exciting mysteries and great adventures.
Sitting on the table in the center of the room, Daniel noticed a large, leather book. In red letters on the cover was the word “Welcome.”
They walked over, opened it up, and read the message inside:
Greetings Friends,
Welcome to the secret reading room. You share a great privilege with the wisest students of Granville. When the Granville School was first built in 1880, the founder, Weston Granville, had this room added as a secret reading room for only the most observant students who loved reading. He decreed that to gain access a student had to solve a series of clues planted by a Granville teacher.
Whenever a teacher finds a student who loves reading, they create a pathway of complex clues. You are here because a teacher at Granville saw promise in you, and you succeeded.
in the will of the school. Only those who earn the privilege of the secret room may enjoy it.
So, congratulations! You have solved the mystery of Granville library.",935.0

It’s all real!” she cried. “I am not—I am not dreaming!” She almost staggered to the books and opened the one which lay upon the top. Something was written on the flyleaf—just a few words, and they were these: “To the little girl in the attic. From a friend.” When she saw that—wasn’t it a strange thing for her to do—she put her face down upon the page and burst into tears. “I don’t know who it is,” she said; “but somebody cares for me a little. I have a friend.”
She took her candle and stole out of her own room and into Becky’s, and stood by her bedside. “Becky, Becky!” she whispered as loudly as she dared. “Wake up!” When Becky wakened, and she sat upright staring aghast, her face still smudged with traces of tears, beside her stood a little figure in a luxurious wadded robe of crimson silk. The face she saw was a shining, wonderful thing. The Princess Sara—as she remembered her—stood at her very bedside, holding a candle in her hand. “Come,” she said. “Oh, Becky, come!” Becky was too frightened to speak. She simply got up and followed her, with her mouth and eyes open, and without a word. And when they crossed the threshold, Sara shut the door gently and drew her into the warm, glowing midst of things which made her brain reel and her hungry senses faint. “It’s true! It’s true!” Sara cried. “I’ve touched them all. They are as real as we are. The Magic has come and done it, Becky, while we were asleep—the Magic that won’t let those worst things ever quite happen.”",720.0

I wonder if any one’s counting?” In a minute there was silence again, and the same shrill voice sang another verse; “‘O Looking-Glass creatures,’ quoth Alice, ‘draw near! ’Tis an honour to see me, a favour to hear: ’Tis a privilege high to have dinner and tea Along with the Red Queen, the White Queen, and me!’” Then came the chorus again:—“Then fill up the glasses with treacle and ink, Or anything else that is pleasant to drink: Mix sand with the cider, and wool with the wine—And welcome Queen Alice with ninety- times-nine!” “Ninety times nine!” Alice repeated in despair. “Oh, that’ll never be done!

" They had almost made it—now all they needed to do was to follow the creek home. The boys reoriented themselves one last time before starting to hike again. But their eager steps were suspended in midair when they heard a noise up ahead. The two froze and strained their ears. Sweat began to bead on Leo’s forehead. Dontrelle held his breath. Then it came from behind the bushes—a fox, a mere five feet away.
Its long, bushy tail flicked back and forth. The fox furtively crept onto a rock in front of them and slowly craned its neck down toward the creek. Just before its tongue touched the crisp water, Leo shifted his weight onto his other foot, inadvertently snapping a twig. The fox twisted its neck over in Leo’s direction and locked eyes with him. No one moved—neither boy nor beast. Then Leo started walking toward the wild animal. “What are you doing? Are you crazy?” Dontrelle whispered through his teeth. “I’m just passing through,” Leo whispered “What? Why?” stammered Dontrelle. “It’s in the stars.” Leo slowly walked toward the fox. After just a few steps, the rust-colored animal bounded away, across the creek and into the woods. Dontrelle exhaled. “You are the fearless lion.” “I suppose I am,” chuckled Leo.
When Dontrelle and Leo finally reached the house, their parents scolded them for their lateness but were relieved that they were safe. After a late dinner, Leo and his father prepared for their drive back to the city. Lucinda invited Leo to stay for the weekend, but instead he asked whether she and Dontrelle could visit them in the city. Lucinda promised they would. Leo extended his hand, and he and Dontrelle shook, knowing they would have many more adventures together.",802.0
" This is the only way. Charlotte didn’t say anything. She thought of all the civilizations that had destroyed themselves because they failed to see the consequences of their actions. She thought about the innocent people living in the developments. She realized she couldn’t save them. The aliens were only doing what they thought was right, but she knew it wasn’t. There had to be a better way. She would help them and her species find it. The explosion in the city could be seen from the Resistance compound, many miles away.
Days after the attacks on the housing developments, the news was filled with images of government raids on Resistance compounds around the world. One of the more popular videos showed Charlotte being rescued from a makeshift prison. Being the only person ever to have been rescued in such dramatic fashion from both the aliens and the Resistance made her quite a celebrity. Not long after being freed, Charlotte found herself standing before a crowd of reporters at a press conference. Just breathe, Artie said in her mind. Remember, your species needs people like you, people who will lead and make the tough choices to help everyone. Charlotte nodded to one of the cameras and stepped up to the microphone. “Hello everyone,” she began. “I’d like to tell you about my time with both the Resistance and the Collective. Let me start by saying we are all flawed—including the Collective—but I’ve learned that if we work together, we may just survive the challenging time ahead. We’ll need to mature and evolve as a species, but that’s been the story of life since its beginning. And for the first time in history, we do not have to do this alone...”",916.0
" Washington worked hard to keep the country from falling apart.
Washington’s birthday is February 22. People celebrated it by setting off fireworks and firing cannon blasts. They held parades, too. In 1879, Washington’s Birthday became a national holiday. He was the first person to be given that honor.
Abraham Lincoln was another amazing president. He held the country together during the U.S. Civil War (1861–1865). At the time, the states in the South wanted to form a country of their own. Many people there wanted to continue owning slaves.
Lincoln did not allow the South to form its own country. The North and South went to war. The war ended, and the North won. The United States remained united, and slavery was made illegal.
Many people honor Lincoln for being a great president. His birthday is February 12. Yet Lincoln’s birthday never became a national holiday.
Some people wanted to combine Lincoln’s birthday and Washington’s birthday into a new holiday called Presidents’ Day. Both men were heroes and presidents, and their birthdays are close together.
Other people did not want to celebrate the two presidents’ birthdays together. Instead, the government let each state decide how to celebrate. Some states decided to celebrate Presidents’ Day. Others continue to celebrate only Washington’s Birthday.
Most people in the United States have Presidents’ Day off from work or school. Many government offices and banks are closed on that day. Special shows about the presidents are on television. Many groups use Presidents’ Day to act out important events in U.S. history. People dress up like Washington, Lincoln, and other presidents.
What do presidents do on Presidents’ Day? Some of them visit George Washington’s home. Others play golf or go on trips with their families. Mostly, the presidents go to work. Presidents don’t get the day off. They have a country to run!",634.0
" In Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks, coniferous trees make up most of the old- growth forests. Giant sequoias grow here, and one of these giants is the largest tree in the world. A sequoia can live for more than 3,000 years.
The Pacific fisher also lives in the park. Its favorite meal is porcupine. Because it only lives in old-growth forests, some states are trying to protect it.
Across the country in North Carolina and Tennessee is Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Old-growth forests make up only a small part of this park. These forests are mostly made up of deciduous trees.
Endangered Carolina northern flying squirrels live here. These animals do not actually fly. They use skin attached to their front and back paws to glide. These animals are in danger because people have cut down other forests where they could live.
Shirakami-Sanchi is one of the last old-growth forests in East Asia. It is a small area in the northern mountains of Japan. Forests like this one once covered most of northern Japan.
The forest is home to a rare kind of serow. This goatlike animal is only found here and in two other small areas in Japan. Black woodpeckers also live here. These birds are endangered in Japan.
The Western Caucasus in Russia has many forests that are mostly made up of coniferous trees. It is home to many different plants and animals.
Some scientists think that a few endangered snow leopards live here. Scientists sometimes find paw prints and other signs. The endangered wisent has also been brought back into the forest.
Old-growth forests may be hundreds or thousands of years old. Many of these places are protected, but some are in danger. Humans can damage or destroy them. Once gone, these old-growth forests may never return.",842.0
" Sally launched a weather satellite. The satellite would be used to find out if the air surrounding the Earth was getting warmer.
Many space shuttles were launched in 1983 and 1984. Judith Resnick, a classmate of Sally’s, had been in space in August, 1983. Many new experiments were completed. Some of the crew walked in space with small jet packs on their backs. They repaired a satellite in space for the first time. Space travel seemed safe and exciting.
After so many successes, NASA decided that ordinary people could join the astronauts aboard a spaceship. The first one chosen was Christa McAuliffe. She was an elementary-school teacher. She planned to give lessons about space as she circled the Earth.
The Challenger was ready to launch on January 28, 1986. Its crew of seven included Judith Resnick and Christa McAuliffe. With the world watching on TV, the Challenger launched into space. But just over a minute after launch, there was trouble. The Challenger exploded. The sky filled with fire and a huge cloud of smoke. The shuttle and its crew were lost. The accident caused NASA to stop its space program for a while. They needed to make space travel safer.
After this terrible accident, Sally Ride decided not to go on another shuttle trip. She kept working at NASA. Then she went to work teaching college science. Before her death in 2012, she also worked to teach young children about the wonders of space travel. She wrote books and taught classes to interest children in space. She continues to be a role model for girls who want to work in science.
Sally Ride was the first American woman to go into space. She helped teach us the wonders of space. She showed us that dreams can come true with courage and hard work.",782.0
" Firefighters sometimes use these helicopters to fight forest fires in remote areas.
Helicopters travel faster than cars. Hospitals use helicopters as ambulances to reach injured people quickly. Police use helicopters to find and chase criminals. Rescue teams use them to look for people who are lost.
Hot-air balloons fly very slowly. They can’t be steered, so they drift where the wind pushes them. Gas burners warm the air inside the balloons, making them rise in the colder air around them. People fly in hot-air balloons for fun. It’s a quiet and unusual way to see the countryside from above.
Blimps are flying machines that are often seen above large sporting events. Blimps are large, long balloons filled with lighter-than-air gas, such as helium. They usually have two small propeller engines and can be steered by a pilot—but they fly slowly. Blimps attract attention, so companies put their names on them for advertising.
Rockets are very powerful engines that force hot gases out behind them to create thrust. In 1957, the Soviet Union surprised the world when it used a rocket to launch the first satellite. The satellite’s name was Sputnik. It captured everyone’s imagination. People thought about space travel—and being astronauts. Since then, rockets have carried people to the Moon and have helped to build a space station.
A space shuttle rides a rocket into space. It carries astronauts and supplies to the International Space Station. On its return trip to Earth, its wings let it land like an airplane.
Today, there are many ways to fly. Hang gliders take off from cliffs and glide to the earth, drifting on air currents. In sleek, thin glider aircraft, people can soar for hours. Long ago, people could only imagine flying like birds. Now, many people have the chance to fly. Where would you like to fly?",823.0
" But there were no real clues. The Mona Lisa seemed to have vanished.
Then came Clue Number Three. But perhaps it shouldn’t be called a clue at all, because it was the thief himself who told the police about his motive for taking the painting. The famous painter of the Mona Lisa, Leonardo da Vinci, was Italian. Leonardo had painted the Mona Lisa in Italy. But the painting had been hanging in a museum in France for years. Can you guess the thief’s motive? Two years after the theft, on December 10, 1913, a man named Vincenzo walked into an antiques store in Florence, Italy. “I have the Mona Lisa,” he said. The owner of the antiques store called the director of a museum in Florence. They both went with Vincenzo to his hotel room.
Vincenzo opened a trunk and removed a false bottom. There was Leonardo’s Mona Lisa. Vincenzo admitted to stealing it. He had been a laborer at the museum. He saw the Mona Lisa every day. He was sad that it was in a museum in France. His motive for taking it, he said, was to return the Mona Lisa to Italy, where he believed it truly belonged.
Safely back in Paris, the painting was examined by experts. They wanted to be sure that this was the real painting, and not a forgery. X-rays and photographs were made. Was this the same paint and varnish used in other Leonardo paintings? What about the wood on which it is painted? How old was it?
The painting was indeed Leonardo’s masterpiece. The Mona Lisa was returned to a special place in the Louvre Museum. It still hangs there today, and is seen by over fourteen thousand people a day.",727.0
" It appeared that Amelia Earhart would once again pull off a historic flight without a hitch. On June 29, 1937, they stopped in New Guinea, just north of Australia. There, they fueled the airplane and checked their maps. When they took off again, there was no hint of any trouble to come.
As they flew close to Howland Island, their radio messages became odd. The U.S. Coast Guard cutter Itasca waited offshore to receive their signals and help them find the island. Those radio signals were irregular and strange. Amelia spoke of a storm, yet the weather over the island was clear. More than twenty hours into the flight, Amelia’s voice said, “We’re running north and south.” She was never heard from again.
What Happened to Amelia?
This question is still a mystery today. The Itasca and the U.S. Navy began searching for Amelia’s plane. The search continued for weeks. No sign of the plane, Amelia, or Fred was found. After a year of searching, Amelia’s husband believed that she died at sea. But is that the full story? Some people think Amelia and Fred survived an emergency landing and were picked up by a Japanese ship.
Others think that Amelia landed the plane, but at a different island. There, she and Fred were able to live on native foods but died of either sickness or old age. Many people believe the easiest answer is that the plane landed in the water. Perhaps Amelia and Fred drowned before they inflated their life raft. Whatever happened, there is no doubt that Amelia Earhart is one of the greatest Americans of the 20th century. She showed everyone that women didn’t have to live with limits. She showed people that anyone could fly. She was a legend.",812.0
" Stay at the bottom of this pond, And never do harm again.” The evil dragon kept nodding its head. As soon as the golden flute stopped blowing, the dragon sank to the bottom of the pond. Bayberry took hold of his sister’s hand and walked happily away.
Not long after Bayberry and Little Red set off, they heard the sound of water splashing in the pond. They looked over their shoulders and saw the evil dragon emerge from the pond. It raised its head and flew in their direction, baring its fangs and clawing the air. Little Red cried: “Go deep when digging a well; Pull up the roots when hoeing a field. While that dragon is still alive, To kindly ways he’ll never yield.”
Bayberry rushed back to the pond and began to blow on his flute once more. The evil dragon fell back into the pond and began to dance again, splashing and squirming in the water. Bayberry stood on the bank of the pond for seven days and nights, blowing a fast tune on his flute. Finally, the evil dragon could move no longer and floated on the surface of the water. Its days had come to an end.
Sister and brother joyfully returned home, dragging the body of the evil dragon along behind them. When their mother saw her two children coming home, her face lit up with happiness. They peeled the dragon’s skin to make a house, took out the dragon’s bones to serve as pillars and beams, and cut off the dragon’s horn to make a plow. With the dragon’s horn they plowed the fields quickly and had no need of oxen. They plowed many fields, sowed lots of grain, and enjoyed a plentiful life.",762.0

In 2007, the government tested the survey. In 2010, the survey was ready to be given across all of Bhutan. Survey teams traveled to mountain villages, valley farms, and cities. More than seven thousand people out of over seven hundred thousand gave information about their lives. This information was analyzed using the GNH Index. The happiest people had the highest numbers. The survey found that women, farmers, uneducated people, and senior citizens were the least happy. The government began to improve health care and daily life. Then another survey was done in 2015. Bhutan learned that its citizens’ happiness grew by 1.8 percent!
There were some areas, though, where it dropped. People did less volunteer work. Not as many people thought traditions were important. Bhutan will work with its communities to improve in those areas. They may hold festivals that include national traditions. The goal is to someday have a population that is 100 percent happy.
Other countries around the world heard about Bhutan’s GNH Index. Some have made their own index to track their citizens’ happiness. In 2007, Thailand created a national happiness index like Bhutan’s. South Korea and Great Britain also developed tools based on Bhutan’s GNH. In 2009, a big company took a happiness survey of people in the United States.
In 2011, the United Nations, an organization of countries around the world, did a study of world happiness. The United Nations put out its first World Happiness Report in 2012. The report listed countries based on their happiness score. That same year, the United Nations named March 20 the International Day of Happiness. Why March 20? On that day, day and night are equally long. This day stands for the Bhutanese king’s belief that balance is the key to national happiness.",831.0
" It was a sparrow conspiracy! Mike ran outside, shouting. The startled birds lifted off and flew away. A little laugh issued from above. Mike looked up to find his sister swinging her legs from a maple branch. “What are you doing?” Mike asked. “Watching,” Aster said.
Mike told his friend Derek about the birds. “They’re eating my investment !” Mike complained. “Sic Pickles on them,” Derek advised. Pickles was Mike’s cat. “Bye-bye, birdies.” “Aw, they’re just birds,” Mike mumbled. He wasn’t really thinking about the birds, though. He was thinking about Aster, up in the tree, watching the birds. Mike constructed a scarecrow instead, but the birds ignored it. The squirrels used the scarecrow’s hat to launch themselves onto the flowers. By the time the seeds were ripe enough to harvest, there were only a handful left—another money-making venture down the tubes.
On the first day of autumn, Mike woke to a bag of sunflower seeds on his pillow—the roasted, salted kind. He carried them to the kitchen, where Aster’s photos were spread across the table. The photos chronicled the sunflowers from start to finish, along with the birds and the squirrels and the scarecrow. She’d even snapped a couple of the farmer. Mike studied the photos and watched the sunflowers rise before his eyes. Maybe, he thought, she knew what she was doing after all. “Thanks for the seeds,” he said to his mom. “What seeds?” she asked. Mike lifted the bag and shook it.
“Those didn’t come from me,” said Mrs. McCarthy. She plated up some scrambled eggs and handed them to Mike. Aster smiled at her brother. “They came from me,” she said. “You bought them?” Mike asked. “Why?” Aster looked back at her photos and everything captured there. “That’s why,” she said.",640.0
" Three years later, they found silver bars with markings they had not seen before. These markings matched the Atocha ’s cargo list. Now they knew they were near the treasure. Still, two years later, they had not found the ship. Then, tragedy struck. Mel’s son, Dirk; Dirk’s wife, Angel; and a diver, Rick Gage, drowned when their search boat overturned in the ocean.
Mel was saddened by the loss, but he decided to continue the search. For ten more years, he and his crew searched for the remains of the ship. In 1985, Mel and his crew finally found the cargo hold of the Atocha. The treasure included gold and silver worth millions of dollars. Mel and his crew marked where everything had been found. They took pictures, too. They wrote down information for historians who might want to study what happened to the ship.
The treasure from the Atocha was great and very valuable. Mel gave a part of the treasure to the state of Florida. He also gave some of the treasure to museums. He shared the rest of the treasure with his family and others who had helped him in his search. He sold some of it, too. Today, you can visit the Mel Fisher Maritime Heritage Society and Museum in Florida. You can see many of the beautiful things he found.
What treasure still waits to be discovered? You could join one of the many treasure-hunting groups around the world. You might discover an ancient city or tomb, or even a sunken or buried chest of gold. You can find many books and websites about treasure and treasure hunting.

“But Sergeant Rotten Teeth is dangerous to our teeth,” Ashley said. “Part of our book review process is to hear different ideas about the books in question. If you don’t like them, Ashley, we’d like to hear “Gladly,” Ashley said. “And Miguel here can say why he thinks the books should stay in the library,” she added. Under his breath, Miguel mumbled something in disgust. It sounded like tooth care.
That Friday’s Whitmore Weekly was all about the possible book ban. I had coeditor Ashley write a column in support of the ban and coeditor Miguel write a column opposed to it. I ran Dan Eaton’s email. And I ran an interview with Mrs. McGuinness that explained the book review committee process. Before school let out, Mrs. McGuinness told me she wanted a student to serve on the committee: me. “There’s one catch,” she said. “You’ll need to read all twelve books.” “Ten down, two to go,” I said.
Six weeks later, a shorter follow-up story appeared. Since I’m in the story, Miguel or Ashley really should have written it. Miguel has lost interest in the series, though, and Ashley was too mad about how the vote turned out.
Whitmore Elementary School will not ban the Sergeant Rotten Teeth series by author Dan Eaton. On a vote of 3-2, the book review committee decided Monday to return the books to the library shelf. Student Noni Lopez cast the decisive vote.

Maybe some children were playing a game.” “Did escaping slaves ever carve directions in trees or rocks?” Poloma asked. “I’ve never heard of it happening, but every day people find new information about the Underground Railroad. Just recently, someone discovered a hidden tunnel and a secret room in a house in Iowa where slaves hid out on the way north.”
“What does ‘Follow the Drinking Gourd’ mean?” Poloma asked. “The Drinking Gourd is the group of seven stars now called the Big Dipper, which can always be found in the northern sky of the United States. Slaves followed the Drinking Gourd from safe house to safe house, until finally they reached freedom.” The sun was beginning to set, and tiny slivers of light were flickering through the branches. Poloma took her flashlight from her backpack, turned it on, and took her grandfather’s hand. By the time they were on the other side of the stream, the sun had disappeared. Poloma stopped and studied the sky. “Are you looking for the Drinking Gourd?” her grandfather asked. “There it is!” Poloma was pointing to the bright shape in the sky. “Shall we follow it?”
“It’s your decision. Are we heading north?” Poloma had to think about that for a minute. The Drinking Gourd would lead them back across the stream, past the boulder with the cipher, and on and on to places north. “We need to go south, Papa.” Poloma and Papa turned.

Three days later the research projects were presented at school. All day long, students shared what they had learned about the Native American tribes of North America: The daring horsemanship of the Dakota as they hunted buffalo on the Great Plains; Chief Joseph and the Nez Perce outsmarting the U.S. Army as the Nez Perce tried to escape to Canada; and the giant, stone houses built into the walls of desert canyons by the Ancient Puebloans.

The deep ocean is freezing cold. The weight, or water pressure, of very deep water can harm you. Sport divers wear air tanks for safety. Deep divers wear a special diving suit. Scientists ride in a small submarine called a submersible.
Scientists who study the ocean are called oceanographers (oh-shuh-NOG-ruh-furs). They often live for months on a ship. Some study what a sea animal eats and where it lives.
Satellites can help to track sea animals’ travels. Scientists tag some animals. A satellite can track the signal from the tag. The signal shows where the animal goes.
What animals live in the ocean? Where do they live? How many are there? Oceanographers studied and counted animals for ten years to find out. The surprising report is called the Census of Marine Life.
The first surprise was where things lived: everywhere! Marine species lived in the hottest and coldest places. Some species lived in deep places without light or oxygen.
The very cold Deep Ocean Zone has hot volcanoes in it. The water temperature at a volcano can be 400ºC (752ºF). Some species of shrimp, crabs, worms, and bacteria live in this very hot water.
Huge groups of Arctic sea life were also found living in freezing water. Some species of squid, cod, and jellyfish live under solid ice that is 700 meters (2,296 ft) thick.
What Did We Learn?
The marine census counted over 230,000 species. Over 6,000 new species had never been seen before! Some creatures were see-through. Some had warning lights that turned on and off. Others had long feelers instead of eyes.
What else lives in the deep ocean? Scientists keep finding new species and new facts. They think that only one-fourth of all marine life has been counted. So there are many more surprises to come!",632.0
" That way, you are sure to have money for the different things you want,” explained his dad. “Sounds like a good idea,” said Brad. “Will you help me make one?”
That night, Brad sat down at the kitchen table with his parents. They made a list of the different types of things Brad wanted to be able to buy. The list included categories such as snacks, entertainment, and clothing.
Brad’s parents explained that a budget should always set aside a percentage of earnings as savings. They told Brad that by saving a little money each week, he could save a lot over time. Then he would be able to buy something expensive in the future.
“It can also be your rainy day fund,” said his mom. Brad gave her a puzzled look. “A rainy day fund is there to help out in an emergency,” she explained. “It’s like an umbrella that keeps you from getting soaked if it rains.” They also said it was important to set aside a little money to help others. They even offered to raise his allowance by $3 a week if he would put aside $2 for charity. Brad quickly accepted their generous offer.
From that day on, Brad always seemed to have enough money to do the things he wanted. Money no longer “burned a hole in his pocket.” At the end of every year, he sat down with his parents. They helped him choose which charity would get the $104 he had set aside.

A group of these plant-eaters must have eaten entire forests. Most meat-eaters wouldn’t attack a group of these giants. They were just too big. Some of these giants may have used their tails as deadly whips. For these dinosaurs, feeding themselves was a much bigger problem than staying safe from meat-eating dinosaurs.
The members of this next group of plant-eaters were smaller. They were usually about 3 to 12 meters (10–40 ft) long. But they made up for their size with large fan-shaped crests that protected their heads and necks. The crests could have as many as eight horns.
Many of these dinosaurs also had horns on their noses and above their eyes. They had strong parrot-like beaks that could snap tree trunks.
These next dinosaurs didn’t run fast, but they could fly. In fact, they were the first animals to fly besides insects. Most of these flyers ate meat. Some caught fish, lizards, and insects while they flew. Others ate dead animals that had been killed by others. One even had wings as long as a bus.
The dinosaurs disappeared in a short period of time. What happened? Most scientists agree that an enormous meteor crashed into Earth. The meteor sent dust and fire into the air. The sun was blocked out for months. The air became colder. Plants died. Rainwater turned muddy and undrinkable. Both plant-eaters and meat-eaters died from not having enough food and water, and from getting sick.
Whatever killed the dinosaurs also killed hundreds of other kinds of plants and animals. It is difficult to think that a single event could have destroyed so much. But one small group of dinosaurs may have lived. When scientists look at the bones of birds and dinosaurs, they see many things in common. Many scientists now believe that some dinosaurs later became birds.",673.0
" Then it attached to a rock and developed into a polyp (PAHL-ip). Over time, the polyp cloned itself through a process called budding. It grew disks that popped off, swam away, and developed into adult jellyfish. One of those adults, or medusas (muh-DOO-suz), is you!
Do You Know? Like other jellyfish, you like to eat fish, crabs, shrimp, and tiny marine animals. The key to successful hunting is the stinging cells in your tentacles. You catch prey as it floats through the water. Some of your cousins also have a glow that attracts fish. Others have a sticky gel that catches animals passing by.
Many animals avoid eating you and your cousins. After all, who wants a mouthful of stinging cells? But some animals don’t seem to mind at all. Sea turtles and some fish and birds think of jellyfish as a real treat. You try hard to protect yourself from being eaten by hiding or by stinging. Still, many of your cousins are eaten while they are still growing or as adults.
People often see your jellyfish cousins on beaches. Sadly, those jellies are either dead or dying. People need to remember to never touch a jellyfish! Even a dead jelly can sting. Most of your jellyfish cousins have a mild sting that is painful and causes a red rash. But the sting of some jellies can be deadly.
Scientists learn new facts about jellyfish every year. They also often discover new kinds of jellies. In 2003, a large red jellyfish that has no tentacles was discovered off the coast of California. People enjoy looking at jellyfish at zoos or aquariums. Watching you gently float through water is fun and relaxing.

The creatures you choose will present your concerns and problems at a meeting tomorrow. The representatives will then vote on what the new rules will be.”
“Maddy’s right,” said one of the other mice. “We’re not accomplishing anything.” The groups returned to where they lived to figure out who would best represent their group. They decided to take votes so every creature would have a say. The elections lasted until late in the evening.
The next day, the creatures representing each group met around the bell in the clock tower. Everyone listened to each group’s issues. When the groups started arguing, Maddy calmed them down and reminded them to work together. Each group then suggested rules that would allow the creatures to sleep. The creatures spent almost as much time as the humans did coming up with their rules and voting on them. In the end, they came up with rules that everyone could agree on.
In September of 1786, the creatures signed their constitution. Maddy had listened to all the creatures and had convinced them to all work together. Since she was such an amazing listener, the creatures asked Maddy to be their leader. Whenever the groups had a problem, they would bring it to Maddy and the representatives.
The night they signed their constitution, the creatures in Independence Hall fell asleep happy. For the first time in as long as they could remember, they all had a good night’s sleep.",700.0

On March 12, Gandhi and some followers began a 21-day, 240-mile (386 km) walk across India to the sea. Along the way, Gandhi spoke to people and made speeches to large crowds. When he reached the coast, tens of thousands of Indians were following him. Early on the morning of April 6, Gandhi went down to the shore. He picked up a grain of salt from the ground. His followers did the same. Gandhi was arrested, along with more than 60,000 others.
The arrests and treatment of Indians caused anger throughout the world. In 1945, British and Indian leaders began to discuss the British leaving India. Throughout India’s history, Hindus and Muslims had often been in conflict. Gandhi believed that the people of these two religions could live in peace in India. The Muslim leaders wanted their own country.
The agreement that ended British rule was signed in 1947. The country was split, against Gandhi’s advice. The Muslim people formed the new country of Pakistan. More than ten million people moved from one country to the other. There was much fighting. Gandhi worked tirelessly and achieved a number of temporary peace agreements. No one else was able to do this at the time.
On January 30, 1948, Gandhi was on his way to a prayer meeting. About five hundred people had gathered to hear his prayers. A young Hindu man in the crowd didn’t approve of Gandhi’s work to make peace with Muslims. He shot Gandhi three times. Gandhi’s death saddened people everywhere. However, this small man, whom Indians called Mahatma, or “Great Soul,” continued to change the world. He inspired such great leaders as Martin Luther King Jr. and Nelson Mandela. He will continue to inspire people for many years to come.",778.0

“We could’ve told you that there’s more to building a pool than digging a hole,” Father said, shaking his head. “You must have known that we would not have given you permission to destroy the garden,” Mother added. “All my hard work is ruined,” she said, picking up a wilted rosebush. After what felt like ages, Father said, “Morty, after this antic, you’d better rethink your summer plans. It isn’t easy to level the ground and seed grass. You’ll also have to work hard to water the lawn and keep everyone off of it until it grows in. It will take years for new shrubs to mature and flower the way your mother’s did.”
“Years?” Morty said with a gulp. “Yes,” Father replied. “It takes time, money, and hard work to nurture plants.” Morty looked at his mother and saw how upset she was about her garden. He remembered seeing her outside each morning, whistling while she tended to her plants. “Mom, I’m really sorry about your garden,” Morty said, hanging his head. “I didn’t think, and I destroyed everything. I promise I’ll work hard and make it look even better than it did before.” Mother continued to scan the ruined yard. “We’ll see, Morty,” she sighed. “It’s going to be a big job.”
“I’m up to the task,” Morty said, and he meant it. He hadn’t predicted that his pool plans could go so horribly wrong. He’d imagined he would make the summer better for everyone, including his parents. Instead, he’d made everything worse. “Well, all gardeners have to start somewhere,” Mother said as she handed him a shovel. Morty stared at the muddy swamp in front of him and wished he had thought things through before he acted. He took a deep breath and began to clean up his mess.",823.0
" She sighs and says, “Sit with me, children.”
“Your mother,” she says to Sarah, “was the best of friends with Qynn’s Uncle Jasper. He was quite the young explorer, and he stayed with us in our village in Nepal. He helped our family come to the United States years ago. Jasper even introduced your mother and father.” “I never knew any of that,” Sarah said.
“When Jasper disappeared, Anna was devastated,” Aunt Terra continued. “She was determined to find him. He was also my friend, so I helped however I could.” “One day Anna asked me to watch you, Sarah, and didn’t come back for a long time—too long. Your father and I were very worried. She came back with the key, scissors, and lantern. She said they had belonged to John Porter and his wife. Anna showed me a map, an old map, and said she could find Porter’s Mill—and she said this was where Jasper had disappeared.”
“Why? What was at Porter’s Mill?” I ask. “I don’t know—adventure, I suppose,” Aunt Terra whispers. “All I know is Anna took those things with her and disappeared herself. Now you have found them, and I think someone is playing a mean joke. That’s why I took them away—I don’t want you to be hurt.”
Aunt Terra stands up, wipes her eyes, and smiles at us. “That’s all I know—no more secrets. I’ll go make you girls holiday cookies in pumpkin shapes. You’d like that, no?” She leaves without waiting for our response. We listen to Aunt Terra moving around in the kitchen for a few minutes. Suddenly Sarah looks straight at me and says, “Well, that settles it.” “Settles what?” “We have to go into the Hollow tomorrow night and find Porter’s Mill.”",566.0

No accounting for tastes! Sing her ‘Turtle Soup,’ will you, old fellow?” The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes choked with sobs, to sing this: “Beautiful Soup, so rich and green, Waiting in a hot tureen! Who for such dainties would not stoop? Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup! Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup! Beau—ootiful Soo—oop! Beau—ootiful Soo—oop! Soo—oop of the e—e—evening, Beautiful, beautiful Soup! Beautiful Soup! Who cares for fish, Game, or any other dish? Who would not give all else for two Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?

" Now, what do you want to buy?” “To buy!” Alice echoed in a tone that was half astonished and half frightened—for the oars, and the boat, and the river, had vanished all in a moment, and she was back again in the little dark shop. “I should like to buy an egg, please,” she said timidly. “How do you sell them?” “Fivepence farthing for one—twopence for two,” the Sheep replied. “Then two are cheaper than one?” Alice said in a surprised tone, taking out her purse. “Only you must eat them both, if you buy two,” said the Sheep. “Then I’ll have one, please,” said Alice, as she put the money down on the counter. For she thought to herself, “They mightn’t be at all nice, you know.” The Sheep took the money, and put it away in a box: then she said, “I never put things into people’s hands—that would never do—you must get it for yourself.” And so saying, she went off to the other end of the shop, and set the egg upright on a shelf. “I wonder why it wouldn’t do?” thought Alice, as she groped her way among the tables and chairs, for the shop was very dark towards the end. “The egg seems to get further away the more I walk towards it. Let me see, is this a chair? Why, it’s got branches, I declare! How very odd to find trees growing here! And actually here’s a little brook! Well, this is the very queerest shop I ever saw!” So she went on, wondering more and more at every step, as everything turned into a tree the moment she came up to it, and she quite expected the egg to do the same.",763.0

" When they were within two paces of each other, Marley’s Ghost held up its hand, warning him to come no nearer. Scrooge stopped. Not so much in obedience, as in surprise and fear. For on the raising of the hand, he became sensible of confused noises in the air; incoherent sounds of lamentation and regret; wailings inexpressibly sorrowful and self-accusatory.
The spectre, after listening for a moment, joined in the mournful dirge; and floated out upon the bleak, dark night. Scrooge followed to the window: desperate in his curiosity. He looked out. The air was filled with phantoms, wandering hither and thither in restless haste, and moaning as they went. Every one of them wore chains like Marley’s Ghost; some were linked together; none were free. Many had been personally known to Scrooge in their lives. He had been quite familiar with one old ghost, in a white waistcoat, with a monstrous iron safe attached to its ankle. He cried piteously at being unable to assist a wretched woman with an infant, whom it saw below, upon a door-step. The misery with them all was, clearly, that they sought to interfere, for good, in human matters, and had lost the power for ever. Whether these creatures faded into mist, or mist enshrouded them, he could not tell. But they and their spirit voices faded together; and the night became as it had been when he walked home.
Scrooge closed the window, and examined the door by which the Ghost had entered. It was double-locked, as he had locked it with his own hands, and the bolts were undisturbed. He tried to say “Humbug!” but stopped at the first syllable. And being much in need of repose; went straight to bed, without undressing, and fell asleep upon the instant.",997.0
" In 1775, the colonies began to fight a war to become independent from Great Britain. During the war, Abigail made meals for soldiers and cared for soldiers who had been hurt.
John was elected to represent Massachusetts at the Second Continental Congress. John and Abigail continued to write letters to each other. Abigail gave John advice. Her letters helped tell the Congress how people in the country thought and felt. The leaders listened to what she had to say. In 1775, the Congress declared the colonies’ independence from Britain, but the war would not end until 1781.
The colonies won the war and finally became an independent country. George Washington was elected the first president of the United States in 1789, and John became the first vice president. John and Abigail moved to Philadelphia, which was the capital at the time. Abigail did not like the capital and soon moved back to the farm. Abigail and John continued to send letters.
John became president in 1797. As First Lady, Abigail gave her husband advice on many things. She spoke out against slavery. She also argued for equal rights for women. Some people in the government did not like that John listened so much to Abigail’s advice. They sometimes called her Mrs. President. Abigail never stopped talking about what she believed.
Abigail was happy when John’s four years as president were over. She wanted to go back to their farm and live a quiet life. Abigail was sick during many of her later years. She died at home on October 28, 1818.

Barack’s work in Chicago made him happy because he was helping poor people. But he saw that to make lasting changes, he would need to learn how to change laws. By changing unfair laws, communities could improve the lives of their people. Barack entered a very good law school near Boston in 1988. He earned a law degree in 1991.
After finishing law school, Barack moved back to Chicago. He worked for a law company. He met a lawyer named Michelle, and they became friends. Barack invited her along when he visited some of the people he had helped in the 1980s. Michelle was moved by Barack’s desire to help people and improve the world. Barack and Michelle married in 1992.
Barack had become a lawyer to help people. But he soon saw that helping people as a lawyer was slow. He decided that entering politics and changing laws would be a faster way to help. In 1996, he won a seat in his state’s senate. In 2004, he won a seat in the U.S. Senate.
Barack gave a hopeful speech at a meeting of the Democratic Party in 2004. He asked all Americans to work together to help the United States become an even greater country. Barack’s words inspired many people. Some of them wanted Barack to run for president in 2008. They were inspired by Barack’s clear thinking and his respect for all people.

" Other people also built train engines. Soon these engines were pulling long lines of cars with passengers or goods. Steam engines helped railroads spread across the world.
In the early 1800s, ships also began to use steam. Some sailed on the oceans. New Yorker Robert Fulton built the first moneymaking river steamboat in 1807. By the mid-1800s, beautiful steamboats traveled up and down American rivers. River steamboats presented the danger that James Watt had warned about. Steam explosions sometimes happened with locomotives, but they were common with steamboats. Many people were injured or killed in steamboat accidents.
One of the worst disasters in American history took place on April 27, 1865. The boiler on the crowded steamboat Sultana exploded. The ship burned. More than 1,700 people died.
By the early 1900s, people had found ways to replace steam power. In factories, electricity now ran most machines. Electric engines did not produce steam or smoke. Electric engines made subways and streetcars easy for everyday use. It became easier to travel around a city. The diesel engine also doomed the steam engine. It ran better and could go farther faster. Steam locomotives ran in the United States until the 1960s. By then, almost all locomotives had diesel engines.
Although the Age of Steam is long over, steam is still important. For instance, power plants use it to produce electricity. It powers your lights and your television.
Some people believe there is still a need for steam power. Steam power, they say, costs less than diesel fuel for trains. Steam power can also be generated using solar panels, which do not use fossil fuels like coal to make electricity. That makes steam power better for the environment than it is now. Steam power is useful and will probably have a place in the modern world.",849.0

The praying mantis often holds its front legs in a praying position. Mantises hide on plants to catch their food. Some praying mantises are green to blend in with leaves, while others that live in the desert are the color of sand. The praying mantis is carnivorous and eats many types of insects as well as small frogs, lizards, and mice. A praying mantis can even catch and eat small birds such as hummingbirds. A mantis has five eyes and can turn its head to look directly behind its body. Its two large eyes can see shapes and colors, and its three small ones just sense light and dark.
Moles burrow underground to find and eat earthworms. They also eat beetles, slugs, and snails. Moles have big appetites and can eat their own body weight’s worth of food in a single day! After digging many interconnecting tunnels that form a maze, a mole builds its nest deep inside. Because its fur points up, a mole can move backward and forward in a tunnel without getting dirt trapped in its coat. Moles have tiny eyes, but they are not blind.
Sea dragons are small fish that are related to sea horses. Their bodies have many parts that look like the stems and leaves of seaweed. They blend in with ocean plants, which helps them catch food and hide from enemies. The female lays many bright pink eggs on the male sea dragon’s tail, and the male carries the eggs until they hatch. Sea dragons don’t use their “leaves” to swim. Instead, they use small, clear fins on their necks and backs that are very hard to see.

" She barely made enough money to eat. Most of her patients were from poor families that had recently moved to the city from Germany and Ireland. Though sometimes they could not pay, she treated her sick patients anyway. She also taught them about healthy eating and good hygiene—keeping clean and not spreading disease. As she worked, an idea formed in her mind. What if she set up her own hospital run by women doctors? In 1857, she established a small hospital for poor women and children in New York City. She was joined by her sister Emily, who had recently become the second woman doctor in the United States. Now women had a place to continue their medical training.
Dr. Blackwell continued to see and treat patients. More and more, though, she devoted her time to promoting medical education for women in the United States and England. In November 1868, Blackwell and her sister opened the Women’s Medical College of the New York Infirmary. It was one of the first medical schools where women were welcomed without doubts or questions.
A year later, Dr. Blackwell moved back to England. She continued to practice medicine there until her retirement in 1877. Afterward, she gave speeches about hygiene and living a moral life. She wrote books to teach girls and women better ways to protect their health. By the time she died in 1910, there were almost 7,400 women doctors in the United States. Today, more than one in every three U.S. doctors is a woman. They practice every kind of medicine. They treat children, save lives in emergency rooms, and do brain surgery. Elizabeth Blackwell’s brave efforts opened the door for all the women doctors who have followed in her footsteps.",919.0

When Morty got home, he took the phone into his room and shut the door. He scattered the birthday photographs across his bed and studied them one at a time. He couldn’t help but smile when he saw his friends looking so happy. He remembered how special he felt that day. After hesitating for a moment, he picked up the phone and dialed Theo’s number. When Theo picked up, Morty said, “Hey, it’s me.” Theo didn’t respond, and Morty felt a lump forming in his throat. Morty swallowed hard, still looking at the photos. “I’m really sorry,” he said. “You made my birthday super fun, and now I don’t feel like we’re friends.” “When everyone was teasing you, I laughed,” Theo replied. “It seemed funny at the time, but I didn’t think about how you would feel. That’s not what a friend would do. I’m sorry, too.”
“Getting even was a scummy move,” Morty admitted. “I was mad about being teased, but I realize now that it doesn’t really matter what people say if they aren’t your friends. You’re my true friend. I hope you’ll forget what I did.” “Sure, I’ll forget, but Peter will still tease us,” Theo said with a sigh. “We’ll stand by each other,” Morty promised. “Friends stick together.” “Yeah,” Theo agreed. “Who says Magic Mice and rainbows can’t be powerful?” They both started cracking up, and Morty finally started to feel good again.",569.0
" But archaeologists have discovered a small Viking outpost in Newfoundland, Canada, that was settled at about this time.
Leif and his crew built a house. They spent the winter in Vinland. On the way home the next year, they found a wrecked trading ship. As a reward for saving the crew, Leif was given all the ship’s cargo. People started to call him Leif the Lucky. But after that adventure, Leif stayed home. Leif never went on another voyage. Two years later, his younger brother asked a favor. He wanted to borrow Leif’s ship. He wanted to see for himself this new land that Leif had found. Leif’s brother and his crew explored the coast of Vinland for over two years. They used Leif’s former winter house as a base.
Some of their explorations were tragic. Their arrival frightened the native people. Small fights happened. But then, men from the ship’s crew killed several native fishermen without reason. Striking back a few days later, angry native men attacked a group of Vikings. In the fight, Leif’s brother was wounded by an arrow. He died there, and his body was buried in Vinland. He became the first European known to have died and been buried in North America.
For about 275 years, the Vikings swept across Europe in wave after wave. Many were hungry to fight and greedy for riches.

Ben sat down with Thomas. He knew that Thomas was bothered by the many changes. Ben was a good friend and told him a funny story to try to cheer him up.
Ben was now in his seventies. He would have liked to take it easy; however, the colonists wanted him to go to France to get help in their fight for independence. Luckily, the French loved Ben. They thought he was friendly, funny, and down-to-earth. He made great friends there. During the American Revolution, France helped the colonies in their fight for independence.
After the revolution, Ben helped establish peace between the new United States of America and Great Britain. He also was elected president of Pennsylvania three times.

This time, they came back in the room after only a few minutes. “Has the jury reached a verdict?” Principal Jeffries asked when everyone was settled. “We have, Your Honor,” said one of the jurors.

Acadia is one of the best birdwatching spots in the country—338 kinds of birds have been seen there. Each autumn, thousands of raptors fly over Acadia as they migrate from Canada for the winter.
Compared to many national parks, Acadia is not very big It doesn’t have many big mammals, either. It has lots of small mammals, though, such as foxes and porcupines.
The most amazing fact about Acadia may be that it became a national park at all. In the western United States, most national parks were created from public land. That’s land that belongs to the government—and, in a sense, to every American. By the early 1900s, the West already had a number of national parks.
In the East, though, things were different. Settlers had been there longer. Much of the East was divided into little pieces and owned by different people. That includes Maine. After it became a state in 1820, more and more people discovered the beauty of its rocky coastline. Rich people bought land there and built fancy summer homes.
Some people wanted to protect the area’s beauty, though. One of these was George Dorr. He and others began to donate their bits of land to the government. In 1919, that land became a national park.
Acadia National Park is a place where sea and mountain meet. People come to see them meet and, of course, to watch the Sun rise. After greeting the new day, there is plenty more to see and do in Acadia. Visitors can hike, climb, fish, or ride a bicycle.

Bundles of fabric are called bolts. One bolt of denim weighs 500 pounds (227 kg). It can make 60 pairs of adult-size jeans. Electric saws cut through 120 layers of cloth at once. The cloth is cut into many sizes and sewn together. One pair of jeans goes through 37 different sewing steps. It takes 213 yards (195 m) of thread to sew one pair of jeans.
Now, people can even order custom- made jeans. You can send all your measurements to a custom jeans company. They will make a pair to fit you perfectly.
Today, all kinds of people around the world wear jeans. People wear them everywhere. Designers have even made denim tuxedoes for the most formal occasions. Jeans are popular today for the same reasons they were popular when Levi Strauss first made them. They look good, they last long, and they are comfortable. That’s probably why you own a pair or two, or seven, yourself.",691.0
" Each of the tails ended up in a different place from where its owner had left it.
Inside the barn, the mood of the guests started to change. The storm seemed to put the cats and dogs in a bad frame of mind. A few cats started complaining, grumbling, and shooting mean looks at the dogs. This made the dogs feel uncomfortable, and before long they began complaining and growling, too.
As the tension grew, the cats grouped together, and the dogs did just the same. One group started insulting the other group, and the other group responded with more insults.
A bolt of lightning crashed through the stormy sky. The hair on the cats’ backs rose, and the dogs bared their teeth. When the cats began to show their claws, one tiny, scared dog shouted, “Let’s get out of here now!” All the dogs fled the barn in a hurry, with the angry cats chasing them. As the dogs passed by the door, they each grabbed a tail without looking at it and kept on running.
The dogs ran as fast as they could until no cats were in sight. Once they had caught their breath, the dogs all tried to put on the tail they had grabbed. At that point, they discovered a problem. All the dogs had grabbed the wrong tail. They tried in vain to find their own tails. Unfortunately, some big dogs ended up with small tails, and some small dogs ended up with huge tails. None of the dogs had their own tail.
To this day, the dogs haven’t forgotten what happened with the cats that night. For that reason, we always see dogs chasing cats, seeking revenge for the night their tails were switched.",673.0
" That’s what scientists think, anyway, but they aren’t sure.
Scientists found the Gorgon’s head starfish in 2010 in the Atlantic Ocean. The Gorgon’s head, a type of basket star, has five arms that split off from its body. The five arms have as many as five thousand tips. The tips help it find food floating by in the water. It also uses its arms to walk along the ocean bottom and to protect itself.
It took until 2013 to find the walking bamboo shark. Like most sharks, it is no threat to humans. It lives off the coast of Indonesia. Scientists found it because the colors on its back are different from those of other sharks. This new species uses its fins to push itself along the ocean floor in search of food. The wiggling movement makes it look as though the shark is walking.
For more than a hundred years, scientists thought the olinguito (oh-lin-GEE-toh) was another species. In 2013, they discovered that they had been wrong. The olinguito leaps through trees at night. The smallest member of the raccoon family, it can be found in South America.
In 2009, researchers found the Cambodian tailorbird. Tests showed that this tailorbird was a new species. Scientists also studied the bird’s song. While all tailorbirds sing, no two species sound the same. Sure enough, the song of the Cambodian tailorbird is different from all the rest.
What’s Next?
Scientists continue to amaze us by finding new species. Experts agree that many more have yet to be found. Many of these newly found species are in danger of dying out. Finding them means we can help save their homes. Doing this can save the animals that live there, both those we know about and those we don’t know about... yet.",666.0
" Deadly gas came into people’s homes, and holes opened up in the ground. Many people moved away, and houses were torn down. Only eight people were allowed to stay for the rest of their lives. The fire is likely to burn for many more years.
Water can be just as deadly as fire. In March 2011, a powerful earthquake struck off the coast of Japan. The earthquake caused huge waves that hit a nuclear power plant near a quiet town. As a result, harmful radiation was released into the air. Thousands of people living near the plant had to move away. No one knows when—or if—anyone will be allowed to go back.
Towns are sometimes left because they are too remote. St. Kilda is a group of small islands that are part of Scotland. For a long time, fewer than two hundred people lived there. However, people had a hard time living on the remote islands. They couldn’t grow enough food or heat their homes. Many young people moved away, and others died because of poor health. The last thirty-six people from St. Kilda were taken to bigger islands in 1930.
Many ghost towns were once lived in. However, the world’s largest ghost town has always been empty. In the early 2000s, a coal-rich area was found in northern China. A city was built nearby to house hundreds of thousands of people. However, it was poorly planned. It is too big and too expensive. The brand-new city stands mostly empty.
Ghost towns can be old or new, and they exist for many different reasons. However, they all have one thing in common: they are lonely places with secrets to share. Learning their stories brings life to places where only shadows and memories are left.",745.0
" We’ve had as many as eight, including the calves.
Interviewer: Do you have any special stories or moments to share?
Jeff: We had to deliver a giraffe calf back in 1998. This was the mom’s third or fourth pregnancy, but she was having trouble with this one. The calf wasn’t moving through the birth canal. I reached inside her and helped pull the calf until the head was out. Then the vet and I pulled her out the rest of the way. The calf must have had her oxygen cut off in the birth canal, but we got her breathing.
The baby didn’t want to nurse for a few days. We kept her with the mom, but we tube fed her. Then on the third day she started nursing on her own, and she turned out to be a really nice animal. She bonded with us, too, so she was really easy to handle. She’s in Kansas City, and she’s one of their best giraffes. She’s almost four years old now.
Interviewer: You found out that if you handle a baby that much at the beginning, it becomes much more manageable. Why don’t you work with all of the babies that way to develop them into that kind of an easy-to-handle animal?
Jeff: We don’t do any hand raising unless we absolutely have to. The mother-reared animal is better because it knows how to behave like the animal it is. Animals that are human-oriented forget to act like a zebra or a giraffe.
Interviewer: Do you see yourself staying in this job for the rest of your working life?
Jeff: I would say so. I’ve had a lot of successes here, and there’s still a lot I want to accomplish. Besides, I find caring for these animals very satisfying, interesting, and challenging.",698.0
" She did her first tandem and will be doing more.
Interviewer: Why do you skydive?
Bob: Most skydivers are really nervous at first. I remember having butterflies in my stomach every time for my first hundred jumps. But we skydivers love the feeling of extreme excitement—the adrenaline rush—when we jump. So even if we’re scared, we continue to jump. Eventually that fear goes away. I’ve done over 4,000 jumps.
I believe we get addicted to the adrenaline rush. I notice it especially during the winter when I’m not jumping much. Most experienced skydivers jump every week in the summer. During the winter we could go months without jumping. I notice a big attitude change during that time, until I get to do a jump.
• Parachutes may have been invented 900 years ago in China. More recently, in 1797, they were first used to jump from hot air balloons. • Parachutes were first used to jump from airplanes in the early 1900s. The first military use of parachutes was in World War I. • In World War II, the most famous use of parachutes was on D-day. Paratroopers (soldiers using parachutes) jumped from airplanes and landed inland not far from the beaches where Allied soldiers were coming ashore. • Sport parachuting, or skydiving, developed after World War II using surplus military parachute equipment. • The first parachutes were round, shaped like an umbrella, and could not be steered. They were originally made from silk. Today’s sport parachutes are rectangular and are shaped like an airplane wing. They are designed with ropes and toggles for steering. Nylon and Kevlar are the most popular materials. • Parachutes used for tandem jumps are larger so they can carry the weight of two people. Very large military parachutes are sometimes used to drop heavy equipment from airplanes.",825.0
" Edison opened the lab to visitors. People were amazed when they saw the lab brightly lit with electric lights.
Edison’s team then had to create an electrical system that could light a building and even a city. In 1881, Edison moved to New York City to help start the first electric power plant. In time, many places replaced gas or oil lamps with electric bulbs.
In 1887, Edison moved into a larger lab in West Orange, New Jersey. Around that time, he was shown a machine that quickly played many still images one after another. The things in the images looked as if they were moving! Edison asked one of his workers, William Dickson, to work on two machines. One machine would record the images, and the other would show them. Dickson and Edison invented the Kinetograph, a motion picture camera. They also invented the Kinetoscope. This projector allowed one person to watch the movie through a small hole. Edison tried to link sound with the images of this new invention. He found it too hard to get the sound and pictures to match, so his films were silent.
Edison continued to put ideas into his notebooks and work with his team to build his inventions. Some of his other inventions included machines for mining, improved batteries, and new uses for cement. During his life, Edison had 1,093 patents, which was a record at the time. He worked until he was more than eighty years old. Thomas Edison died on October 18, 1931. President Herbert Hoover asked people to turn out their lights for a short time. He asked them to think about the great changes Thomas Edison had made in their lives. As Edison once said, “If we did all the things we are capable of doing, we would astound ourselves.”",868.0
" Robert Catesby and three others were killed in a gunfight. The rebellion had failed.
The English courts sentenced each of the eight surviving plotters to death for being a traitor. In January 1606, Guy Fawkes and three others were executed. Their punishment was a warning to anyone who might try the same.
Another Conspiracy?
Some people believe that the king’s own ministers might have helped the plotters. One of the king’s ministers may have even written the warning letter. Perhaps the government knew the plotters had rented the basement and smuggled the gunpowder inside. Stopping the plot could have been a way to make Catholics look bad and create support for the unpopular king. There is no proof of this version of the story. However, stopping the Gunpowder Plot did give the English people relief. Their king was safe. Parliament officially made November 5 a day of celebration. The celebration was meant to strengthen the people’s loyalty to the king.
The holiday was first known as Gunpowder Treason Day. In the seventeenth century, people rang church bells and lit bonfires to mark the day. In England then, people already burned dummies on bonfires. They believed that doing this would drive away evil spirits. On November 5, people began to burn a dummy of Guy Fawkes on the bonfire.
In the nineteenth century, big firework displays and parades began. People marched to where the bonfire and firework displays were held. Now, the bonfires are put on by local organizations.
Guy Fawkes Day celebrates the failure of the Gunpowder Plot to kill the king of England. These events happened over four hundred years ago. Today, people around the United Kingdom look forward to bonfires and fireworks on November 5. Guy Fawkes Day has become a day to celebrate and have fun with friends and family.",849.0
" The sheep was unhappy to leave her feast, but Alejandro managed to get her back through the tunnel. Before he followed, he stopped to pick one of the flowers—a yellow-tongued porcelain orchid. He remembered his father bringing them to his mother after working on the estancia. The orchids had once been very common, but these were the first Alejandro had seen since his father died.
He was about to leave when he noticed a sudden movement. A puma stood on a flat rock overlooking the patch of grass, staring at him with big yellow eyes. Alejandro returned the hunter’s gaze, slowly backing toward the opening. Then, as if giving up, the cat lay down with a low sigh, its eyes lazily half closing. Alejandro almost felt sorry for the beast. After all, he had ruined its meal.
With his heart still pounding, Alejandro placed the flower in his pouch and lifted the bleating sheep over the fence. He finally felt safe when he reached the other side. As he nudged his horse forward, he couldn’t push the blooming pasture and the puma from his mind. They were wild, strong, and healthy. The estancia was no longer a place for wild things, but instead a land controlled. The fences were keeping the sheep from the rich pastures beyond.
Alejandro imagined an estancia with no fences. Some of the sheep might die from puma attacks, but the flock as a whole would survive and grow stronger. He realized that he could tell his mother that he had truly learned something today. Alejandro urged his horse into a gallop. He had to talk to Martín and the other gauchos. It was time to return to the old ways. They could fix this. There was still time.",840.0
"” The wrinkles returned to Nannie’s forehead. Samantha quickly added, “I had a great time, and I have a new idea. When I get back home, I’m going to teach the people there how to compost. I can save people money and help protect the environment.” Nannie laughed. “That’s a wonderful idea! Green really does run in our family.” A few minutes before Samantha boarded the airplane, her grandmother handed her an envelope.
“What’s that?” Samantha asked. “Look inside,” Nannie said. Samantha opened the white envelope and saw a stack of ten- and twenty-dollar bills. She stammered, “I can’t—“ “Yes, you can,” her grandmother said. “You helped me all summer with the garden and the composting workshops. Now you can go to camp next summer.” “But you need this money!” Samantha blurted. Her grandmother laughed. “No, I don’t! I have all the money I need.” “But—but—you always looked so worried this summer.” “I was worried,” Nannie said. “I was worried about you. I was worried that you were miserable staying with me instead of doing exciting things at camp.” Samantha dropped her bags and hugged her grandmother. “I had an amazing summer! I wouldn’t trade this summer for all the camps in the world!”
Nannie said, “Honey, that is the loveliest thing anyone has ever told me.” Samantha said, “You taught me a lot. You taught me that being green isn’t just about recycling and turning off lights. It’s about working with the earth and helping other people.” Samantha grabbed her bags and walked toward the gate. “You’ll come visit us in the city, “Yes!” Nannie said, blowing her a kiss.

" It’s time to mend the sails of our battleships and cruisers’?” “Well done, Word, go again.” “Wait,” interrupted Hannah, “you two are too evenly matched—we’ll be fear however, I mean here forever—let’s decide this dispute with one ultimate riddle. If the PUNisher answers correctly, he gets the letters and dominates the dictionary, but if Word is right, the letters stay, and the PUNisher makes like a tree and leaves.”
“A riddle? I invented riddles,” laughed the PUNisher. “You’re on.” “Hannah, he’s the wizard of riddles.” “But you have the gift of illogical logic, Word.” Then she gave me a hug, and I took it. “You two have ten seconds,” said Hannah, “so tell me: ‘Two wrongs don’t make a right, but three of these, do.’” This was new for me, but it reminded me of my daily crossword puzzles—I stole a look at the PUNisher and spied a cocky smirk on his face. “Seven seconds.” I got lost in thought again, walking one way, then another, then another. “Three seconds.” Then it struck me like a clock at midnight. I snagged another glimpse at the PUNisher to see if he knew the answer. He hadn’t moved. However, the smirk on his face had vanished.
“Time’s up,” called Hannah, “two wrongs don’t make a right, but three of these do.” “Uhm,” said the PUNisher meekly, “three wrongs?” “No,” I said coolly, “it’s three left turns. See, I turned left, then left, and left again, and suddenly I was facing in the right direction.” “Absolutely right,” cried Hannah and added an e to the hug to make it huge. We won!

" “Is that all?” Alice timidly asked. “That’s all,” said Humpty Dumpty. “Good-bye.” This was rather sudden, Alice thought: but, after such a very strong hint that she ought to be going, she felt that it would hardly be civil to stay.
So she got up, and held out her hand. “Good-bye, till we meet again!” she said as cheerfully as she could. “I shouldn’t know you again if we did meet,” Humpty Dumpty replied in a discontented tone, giving her one of his fingers to shake; “you’re so exactly like other people.” “The face is what one goes by, generally,” Alice remarked in a thoughtful tone. “That’s just what I complain of,” said Humpty Dumpty. “Your face is the same as everybody has—the two eyes, so—” (marking their places in the air with this thumb) “nose in the middle, mouth under. It’s always the same. Now if you had the two eyes on the same side of the nose, for instance—or the mouth at the top—that would be some help.” “It wouldn’t look nice,” Alice objected. But Humpty Dumpty only shut his eyes and said, “Wait till you’ve tried.” Alice waited a minute to see if he would speak again, but as he never opened his eyes or took any further notice of her, she said, “Good-bye!” once more, and, getting no answer to this, she quietly walked away: but she couldn’t help saying to herself as she went, “Of all the unsatisfactory—” (she repeated this aloud, as it was a great comfort to have such a long word to say) “of all the unsatisfactory people I ever met—” She never finished the sentence, for at this moment a heavy crash shook the forest from end to end.",728.0

But first, we’re to be together all the Christmas long, and have the merriest time in all the world.” “You are quite a woman, little Fan!” exclaimed the boy. She clapped her hands and laughed, and tried to touch his head; but being too little, laughed again, and stood on tiptoe to embrace him. Then she began to drag him, in her childish eagerness, towards the door; and he, nothing loth to go, accompanied her.
A terrible voice in the hall cried, “Bring down Master Scrooge’s box, there!” And in the hall appeared the schoolmaster himself, who glared on Master Scrooge with a ferocious condescension , and threw him into a dreadful state of mind by shaking hands with him. He then conveyed him and his sister into a shivering parlour, where the maps upon the wall, and the celestial and terrestrial globes in the windows, were waxy with cold. Here he produced a decanter of curiously light wine, and a block of curiously heavy cake. Master Scrooge’s trunk being by this time tied on to the top of the carriage, the children bade the schoolmaster good-bye right willingly. They drove gaily down the garden-sweep: the quick wheels dashing the hoar-frost and snow from off the dark leaves of the evergreens like spray. “Always a delicate creature, whom a breath might have withered,” said the Ghost. “But she had a large heart!” “So she had,” cried Scrooge. “You’re right. I’ll not deny it, Spirit. God forbid!” “She died a woman,” said the Ghost, “and had, as I think, children.” “One child,” Scrooge returned. “True,” said the Ghost. “Your nephew!”Scrooge seemed uneasy in his mind; and answered briefly, “Yes.”",936.0

These friendly birds like a large crowd. Their nests can hold up to four hundred birds. They use large sticks and dry grass for the nest’s roof and sides. The inside is lined with softer grasses.
Tiny termites can build mounds that are taller than three people standing on top of each other! They build their mounds with mud and chewed wood. The walls have tiny holes for fresh air.
These male fish make sand art to attract females. They form a large round pattern on the seafloor and decorate the circle with shells. If a female likes the circle, she lays her eggs in the middle.
These sly spiders dig an underground tunnel and make a trapdoor on top. They cover the trapdoor with their silk , and then cover that with dirt. When prey passes above them, they open the door and the prey falls through.
Millions of ants work together to build underground ant cities. These giant cities have dirt “highways” that connect rooms. Side roads lead to gardens and trash pits.
Paper wasps chew bits of wood and plants to make a soft nest. The nest is made up of cells that look like an egg carton. Wasp eggs grow in the cells. As the wasps grow in number, the nest gets bigger.
Crayfish dig into moist soil to reach water. The dirt they push up looks like a small chimney. Other animals, such as snakes, sometimes hide in the empty chimney.

" Valley glaciers flow down mountains. A fast glacier can flow 20 meters (70 ft) in one day. But that is very unusual. Most glaciers travel only a few centimeters (less than 1 in) to 30 centimeters (1 ft) a day.
Like giant bulldozers, glaciers push piles of rocks and soil as they slide forward. These piles are called moraines. Some of the rocks and soil get stuck in the ice. The rocks scrape the land beneath the glacier, leaving huge scars.
Some glaciers scrape off entire mountainsides. Valley glaciers carve deep U -shaped valleys with steep cliffs. When a glacier flows below the snow line, the bottom melts, forming a river. Some glaciers carve valleys that reach all the way to the sea. Seawater fills these valleys, creating fjords (fee-YORDS). Continental glaciers flatten the land.
As glaciers reach the ocean, they crumble and slide into the water. Sometimes, big chunks of ice fall into the sea. The broken-off pieces are called icebergs. Some icebergs in the Antarctic Ocean are nearly 80 kilometers (50 mi) long.
Some glaciers melt, or recede (ree-SEED), and eventually disappear. Glaciers recede when the weather gets warmer or less snow falls. Receding glaciers leave their moraines behind as long ridges of rocks and soil. This soil is called till. It can be good for growing food. Glaciers may also drop huge boulders when they melt. Sometimes glaciers create lakes and ponds when the ice melts on the land.
Glaciers are one of many things that give the Earth its beautiful and interesting shapes. In the past 100 years, many glaciers have receded. The Earth’s temperature may be getting warmer. Scientists are watching glaciers to see how they are affected by temperature changes. They can learn a lot about our planet from these enormous rivers of ice.",796.0
" With her mother’s blessing, Agnes left her family at age eighteen and went to Ireland. There she became a nun and chose the name Sister Teresa.
The nuns had schools in India. They sent Sister Teresa to Calcutta, one of India’s largest and poorest cities. She taught there and later became the school’s principal.
Teresa believed that she received a message from God one day in 1946. She believed that God wanted her to go work in the slums with poor and sick people. Sister Teresa would later call it her “day of inspiration.” “The message was very clear,” Sister Teresa said. “It was a command. I knew where I had to go.”
Wearing a simple white and blue dress, Sister Teresa left the school. She began teaching children under a tree, scratching the letters of the alphabet into the dirt with a stick. She also began caring for sick people. In 1950, other nuns came to work with Sister Teresa. That’s when she formed the Missionaries of Charity and became known as Mother Teresa.
In Calcutta, many people were too poor to go to doctors. Mother Teresa worried that so many people died alone on the streets. So in 1952, she opened a special home for poor and dying people. She also opened a home for children whose parents had died or who were too poor to care for them.
Mother Teresa died in 1997 at the age of 87, but the work of the Missionaries of Charity goes on. As of 2016, more than 5,800 men and women help sick and poor people in 139 countries. Her story goes on as well. On September 4, 2016, before huge crowds in Rome, Pope Francis declared her a saint.",772.0
" In 1965, Mariner 4 orbited Mars and took clear pictures. The pictures proved the “canals” were just the natural landscape of ridges, gullies, and canyons.
Later Mars missions tested its atmosphere. These tests showed the atmosphere was so cold that any liquid water would freeze or evaporate. As far as we know, all life needs liquid water to exist. Without proof there was water, it seemed nothing could be living there. Mariner 9 orbited Mars in 1971. It took new pictures that showed plains, volcanoes, and valleys. It also showed landforms that looked like dry riverbeds and oceans. Could that be true?
Mars Viking landed on the planet in 1976. It scooped up dust and tested it for organic materials, the remains from living things. It didn’t find any. Mars Pathfinder landed in 1997. Its tests failed to find proof of life either. But it did find pebbles that may have been worn down by liquid water.
More satellite pictures were looked at, and more tests were done. Many scientists felt certain that Mars used to be warmer, with rivers and oceans. They saw long canyons and deep gullies that could have been carved by flowing rivers and waterfalls. If these ideas are true, then why did all the water, and its life forms, disappear?
In 2003, tests showed that methane gas was escaping through the rocky crust of Mars. But what was producing the gas? Was it a byproduct of simple, microbial forms of life that existed deep underground? It’s one of the many questions scientists hope to answer with the new Mars Science Laboratory rover, Curiosity. It landed on Mars in 2012. Curiosity will have a chance to earn its name by solving some of the greatest mysteries on Mars.",891.0
" Their purpose is to pollinate crops like alfalfa, an important animal feed, and melons and almonds. Inside every flower, an anther produces pollen. This is a powder that contains the male cells of the plant. There is also a pistil, which produces seeds when pollen from another flower brushes on it. When a bee goes into a flower to get nectar, pollen from the anther rubs onto the bee. When she goes to the next flower, the pollen rubs onto the pistil.
Different flowers have different flavors of nectar. Orange-blossom honey tastes different from apple-blossom honey. People with orchards don’t have time to keep bees, so they rent bees from me. I take my bees into their orchard at night and leave them for a week or two. After the flowers have fallen off the trees, I take the bees home. When I take my bees to an apple orchard, I get apple-blossom honey. If I took them to an orange orchard, I’d get orange-blossom honey.
Interviewer: How much honey do you get from one beehive? Buzz: Between 60 and 350 pounds (27–159 kg.) of honey a year, depending on the location and how hardworking the bees are. Bees are like people. Some people get up early and work.
Interviewer: How do you get the honey out of the comb? Buzz: A wax cap seals the honeycomb. I have to cut off the capping and then put the frame into a machine that spins around. This makes the honey fly out of the cells. I give the comb back to the bees, and they fill it up again. After the honey comes out, I heat it to thin it. Then I filter out the wax and put the honey in jars.",762.0

Before Morty could answer, Miss Snickerwiser opened the door and looked inside. “It just sparkles!” she said. “And it smells like you used a Fresh Apple Air Freshener. I love that smell.” Morty was staring at an apple seed stuck to his paw when he spoke up. “Miss Snickerwiser, before I washed your car, I played a pretty mean trick on you.”
Miss Snickerwiser was looking at Morty now, raising one eyebrow in a puzzled expression that prodded Morty to continue. “I filled your car with old apples from Mr. Albert’s orchard. I added water, and the sun cooked up a nasty batch of applesauce in your Mouse Mini.” Morty looked in her eyes, “I’m really sorry.” Miss Snickerwiser’s face showed no emotion. She looked in her car again and ran her paw over the dashboard. It wasn’t even sticky.
Miss Snickerwiser smiled at Morty and patted his head. “I love my clean car,” she said. “I accept your apology.” “But next time you decide to leave the playground, you really need to tell me.” Then she asked, “Morty, will you do me one little favor?” “When you get home, will you tell your mother ‘Thank you’?” Now Morty’s face looked puzzled. Miss Snickerwiser smiled one of her big twinkling smiles and explained, “Your mom has done a fine job of teaching you to wash the dishes after you cook.”
Morty laughed as Miss Snickerwiser drove off in her immaculate Mouse Mini. Then he returned the cleaning supplies and found Ben and Fred to walk home.

In 1588, Philip ordered a large group of ships to set sail and invade England. The ships were loaded with soldiers. Spain, however, was not prepared for the strength of the English. English ships forced the Spanish ships far to the north. Many Spanish ships crashed on the rocky shores, and many men died.
Over time, Elizabeth reduced the religious fighting that had torn apart her country. The Protestant church became the official religion of England. There was great growth in education and the arts. More people than ever before learned to read and write. Theater became very popular during Elizabeth’s time and writers often brought plays and actors to her court. Some plays were about the events happening in England at the time, and some were comedies that Elizabeth enjoyed. She also loved poetry and playing music.
During her time as queen, Elizabeth developed a strong government and a powerful navy. Wanting to bring good things to the country she loved, she encouraged exploration of new places and trade with foreign countries. Trade of goods such as silk and food made money for England. England was set to become a global empire and the Elizabethan Age came to be known as the “Golden Age” in English history. As a result of growth during this time, England became one of the most important countries in the world.
Elizabeth died in 1603 at the age of sixty- nine. She ruled England for forty-four years. She named Protestant James VI, the son of Mary, Queen of Scots, as the new king. By doing so, she united Scotland and England. Elizabeth I was a well-educated, strong queen. She proved that a woman could be a successful ruler.

" Some people call shark egg cases “mermaids’ purses.”
Many people are afraid of sharks, but most sharks do not attack humans. In fact, bees kill more people each year than sharks do. Only a few kinds of sharks are known to attack humans regularly. One of these is the great white shark. Great white sharks usually eat large animals, such as sea lions and other sharks.
Even small sharks may bite if disturbed or surprised. Shark attacks are usually the result of people swimming in shark territory. Sharks also confuse humans with their prey. Many shark attacks involve the shark taking one “test bite” and then swimming away when it realizes that the human is not its prey.
One of the strangest looking sharks is the hammerhead shark. It has a flat head with a large lobe on each side. The eyes and nostrils are positioned on the ends of these lobes. Its strange head shape helps the hammerhead see around and behind it.
People hunt sharks for many reasons. Sharkskin is used to make shoes, belts, and wallets. Shark oil is used in many cosmetics. Shark teeth are used for jewelry. Many people eat shark meat. Chefs use shark fins to make a popular soup, and the sharks usually die when their fins are removed.
Many kinds of sharks are now in danger of extinction (being completely wiped out). People often do not protest when sharks are killed because sharks are thought to be mean and dangerous. However, most sharks are not dangerous to humans.
Sharks do not reproduce nearly as quickly as other fish. When they are killed, it takes much longer for their numbers to increase again. Sharks are an important part of the balance of life in the world’s oceans. They have as much right to exist as any other animal.",757.0
" These improvements led to the computers we use today. But computers still needed other inventions. People needed to invent software to make the computer do different things. Also, people wanted thinner screens and mice that were easier to use. Even more inventions came as people discovered new things to do with the computer.
Computers paved the way for the Internet, a whole new way of communicating. Webpages, electronic mail, and high-speed Internet connections soon followed. These things made communicating with people all over the world easy. What might computers do in the future? What will be invented then?
Invention, Discovery, or Creation?
Have you ever wondered how an invention is different from a discovery or a creation? Discoveries are made when people first learn about things that already exist. For example, explorers are people who discover new lands. Creators are artists, composers, and writers. They make works of art, music, and stories. Vincent Van Gogh was an artist who created fantastic paintings. Beethoven was a composer who created beautiful symphonies. William Shakespeare was a writer who created great plays. Inventors use existing knowledge to create new devices or processes. They make things that they think make life better or work easier. Thomas Edison used what scientists already knew about electricity to invent the lightbulb. He went on to invent many more things, such as the first movie projector.
You might think that all the good things have been invented and that there is little left to invent. But that is not true. There is always a need to make things better. With each new invention, creation, and exploration, another is sure to follow. Maybe you will be the person who will invent the next product to make life easier or more exciting for us all!",836.0
" He wanted to play the music at his wife’s funeral, but he wanted to say that he had written it himself. But Mozart didn’t know this.
Wolfgang began writing. He wrote feverishly, staying up all night, sometimes even forgetting to eat. The work exhausted him, and he began to grow weak. Mozart had been making a little money by teaching music students. But now he was so wrapped up in the requiem that he cancelled all of his classes. Without money, the family couldn’t afford much food. They couldn’t afford candles to light their cold house at night. But still Mozart wrote, growing weaker and weaker. Finally, just before finishing the requiem, Mozart died. It truly had been his own requiem.
Mozart is still considered the greatest musician who ever lived. But when he died, his family was so poor they could not purchase a gravestone. Eventually, no one could remember where he had been buried. Today there is a great monument to Mozart in Vienna, and on it is an inscription reading, “The probable site of his grave.”
Mozart’s music is still played today. He wrote such famous operas as The Marriage of Figaro and The Magic Flute, and the piano piece, “Eine Kleine Nachtmusik” (which means “a little night music” in German). You may not have heard of these pieces of music, but if you heard them being played, you might recognize them. Mozart’s music is used everywhere. You can hear it in a concert hall, or you can hear it in cartoons. He wrote many of his most famous pieces when he was only a little older than you are. And he died while he was still young. Imagine the wealth of music we might have if he had only lived.",795.0
" They voted for leaders who shared their views. Even though their past was hard, the people of Argentina now have hope for tomorrow.
Every year, Argentina comes alive with festivals. One of them is Carnival. During this festival, people build huge, colorful floats that parade down the street. Musicians, dancers, and others enjoy the event. People also have fun dressing up as clowns, animals, and cartoon characters. The Gaucho Festival of San Antonio de Areco is another popular event. During this festival, gauchos show their skill with horses during a ten-day celebration in November. It includes bronco riding, dancing, and parades. Another big celebration in Argentina is on July 9. This holiday marks the date when Argentina separated from Spain. People often celebrate with food and parades.
The Spanish, French, and Italian people who moved to Argentina have helped shape what people eat. Today, foods from all these cultures are popular in Argentina. People often grill steak on an open pit or barbecue. Empanadas are popular, too. These small, tasty pies can be filled with meat, vegetables, cheese, or fruit. People also enjoy Italian food such as pasta and pizza. Many people in Argentina drink a tea called yerba maté. They say it gives them energy and helps them stay alert.
Argentina is a country with citizens from all over the world. During the past twenty years, people from China, South Korea, and other Asian countries have chosen to live there. Argentina is a modern country. It believes in equal rights for all and wants its citizens to take part in government. It also understands the importance of protecting its land. Although unrest was part of its history, the people of Argentina hold great hope for their future.",857.0

“Doesn’t anybody else see a face in the garden?” asked Aunt Dee. “Woof,” answered Murray. “Meow,” answered the stray cat that had caused all the commotion. I looked at my garden again. Then I saw what Aunt Dee saw! The circular path where Murray chased the animals around and around was the head. Two dark spots where animals dug holes were the eyes. The small half-circle where the animals ran in and out of the garden was the mouth.
“Now that you mention it, I do see a face, and it’s smiling,” said Gattie’s friend. “It’s quite charming! What a lovely way to welcome spring. Congratulations to the artist.” For the next 20 seconds, which felt like 20 years, everyone “hmmmed” while looking at my garden. They stroked their chins in thought. They “hmmmed” some more. Then everyone, not counting Mr. Rooney, started to applaud! And most importantly, they were all smiling! “Thank you, but it was a team effort,” I said, beaming the biggest smile of everyone. “Woof,” said Murray. “Meow,” said the kitty. “You’re still weird, Charly,” said Ethan. “But I have to admit, you really did it this time.” Then he, too, smiled and stuck out his hand for me to shake.

When a saguaro dies, its fleshy skin falls to the ground. Termites, scorpions, and lizards burrow new homes inside of it. Slowly, the body of the saguaro decomposes, and it turns back into desert soil. The saguaro’s wooden ribs often remain standing like a tribute to the cactus’s life. But after a while, these ribs also fall down.
The mighty saguaro has come to symbolize the Sonoran Desert. It shows up on postcards, in movies, and on Arizona license plates. The saguaro even has a park named after it! Saguaro National Park near Tucson, Arizona, is the home of many beautiful saguaros. Visitors from all over the world come to see these mysterious giants. They take photographs of themselves with the saguaros. Some tourists like to hike on park trails and enjoy the beauty of the saguaro in their Sonoran desert home. Today, there are laws to protect saguaros. In certain places you cannot dig them up without a permit. If you do, you can be fined. When new roads are built, saguaros are moved to keep them safe.
These are just some of the secrets of the mighty saguaro. Other stories may never be known. But one day you might visit the Sonoran Desert. You might walk out into the desert’s silence and sit next to a saguaro. You might carefully touch its tough skin and stare up at its huge green arms. You might picture the animals that have eaten its fruit. You might even scratch your head and try to guess its age. You might wonder, “Will it still be standing here when I am old and gray?” If nothing else, perhaps you will just sit and enjoy the sunset. If you listen long enough, maybe the saguaro will whisper some of its secrets.",771.0

It was an app you can use to raise money for a cause online. We can set a funding goal, and people can contribute whatever they want from their phones or computers.” “We can certainly try it,” Ms. King said. For the rest of that week, Elias and Ada worked with Ms. King to set up a fund-raiser online. They worked especially hard on the wording of their funding appeal, trying to make it as persuasive as possible. On Friday, the fund-raiser went up, and Ms. King personally shared it on the school’s social media pages. Elias and Ada posted links, too, and asked their parents and friends to share it widely. Then they sat back to wait and hope.
Over the weekend, they watched as their fund- raiser link was shared, and shared, and shared again throughout their town. On Monday morning before the start of school, Elias and Ada raced into the principal’s office with some news. The owner of a local sporting goods store had called Elias personally to offer sponsorship of the school’s P.E. program for the next five years. Ms. King sat back in her chair and looked from one to the other. “Well done, you two,” she said quietly. Elias and Ada grinned at each other and exchanged a high-five.

“Jackson asks Mountain what’s happening with his hair, and Mountain, who looks pretty embarrassed, explains that after he stole the cap, he saw Jackson’s blue hair and thought it looked really cool. Since his favorite color was green, he decided to color his hair green instead of blue. He kept it under the cap because he wasn’t sure if the other people at school would think it was cool, too.”
“Excellent writing,” said the pen. “When you have two characters talking to each other, it’s called dialogue.”
Tyler nodded and continued, “Jackson stands on the table for a minute, examining Mountain’s hair, and then he declares that Mountain’s hair looks great. When he says this, he takes off the pom-pom hat.”
“Mountain asks him how he gets his hair so blue, and Jackson tells him that it grows that way. Mountain says that’s the most amazing thing he’s ever heard and invites Jackson to sit with him and his friends.”
“After lunch, Jackson realizes that people weren’t laughing at his blue hair, but at Mountain for wearing a hat that didn’t fit his massive head. He also realizes that his blue hair, the thing that makes him unique, the thing that he has been embarrassed about for so long, was the key to making friends.”
“That’s wonderful,” said the pen. “An exceptional ending. I kind of want to cry, but I don’t want my ink to run.”
“Thank you,” said Tyler. “I guess writing isn’t such a waste of time.”

“And I hit everything within reach,” cried Tweedledum, “whether I can see it or not!” Alice laughed. “You must hit the trees pretty often, I should think,” she said. Tweedledum looked round him with a satisfied smile. “I don’t suppose,” he said, “there’ll be a tree left standing, for ever so far round, by the time we’ve finished!” “And all about a rattle!” said Alice, still hoping to make them a little ashamed of fighting for such “I shouldn’t have minded it so much,” said Tweedledum, “if it hadn’t been a new one.” “I wish the monstrous crow would come!” thought Alice. “There’s only one sword, you know,” Tweedledum said to his brother: “but you can have the umbrella—it’s quite as sharp. Only we must begin quick. It’s getting as dark as it can.” “And darker,” said Tweedledee. It was getting dark so suddenly that Alice thought there must be a thunderstorm coming on. “What a thick black cloud that is!” she said. “And how fast it comes! Why, I do believe it’s got wings!” “It’s the crow!” Tweedledum cried out in a shrill voice of alarm: and the two brothers took to their heels and were out of sight in a moment. Alice ran a little way into the wood, and stopped under a large tree. “It can never get at me here,” she thought: “it’s far too large to squeeze itself in among the trees. But I wish it wouldn’t flap its wings so—it makes quite a hurricane in the wood—here’s somebody’s shawl being blown away!”",664.0

When I had done this, I began to work my way into the rock. Thus I made a cave, just behind my tent, which served me like a cellar to my house. Having now fixed my shelter, I found it absolutely necessary to provide a place to make a fire and fuel to burn. What I did for that, and how I enlarged my cave, I shall tell in its place. But I must now give some mention of myself and of my thoughts about living.
I was cast away upon that island after having been driven by a violent storm. We were quite out of the course of our planned voyage and some hundreds of leagues out of ordinary trade routes. I had great reason to consider it my fate that in this desolate place, and in this desolate manner, I should end my life. Many tears would run down my face when I had these thoughts. Sometimes I would ask myself why I was so absolutely miserable, so without help, abandoned, so entirely depressed. It could hardly be reasonable to be thankful for such a life.
But something always turned around inside me and stopped these thoughts. Particularly one day, walking by the seaside, I was very sorrowful about my present condition. But I thought to myself, “Well, you are in a desolate condition, it is true. But, pray remember, where is the rest of your crew? Did not eleven of you come in the boat? Where are the other ten? Why were they not saved, and you lost? Why were you singled out? Is it better to be here or there?” and then I pointed to the sea. All evils are to be compared with the good that is in them, and with what worse might have been.",899.0

Tut, don’t I know,” she added in the same breath, laughing as he laughed. “Mr. Scrooge.” “Mr. Scrooge it was. I passed his office window; and as it was not shut up, and he had a candle inside, I could scarcely help seeing him.
His partner lies upon the point of death, I hear; and there he sat alone. Quite alone in the world, I do believe.” “Spirit!” said Scrooge in a broken voice, “remove me from this place.” “I told you these were shadows of the things that have been,” said the Ghost. “That they are what they are, do not blame me!” “Remove me!” Scrooge exclaimed, “I cannot bear it!” He turned upon the Ghost, and seeing that it looked upon him with a face, in which in some strange way there were fragments of all the faces it had shown him, wrestled with it. “Leave me! Take me back. Haunt me no longer!” Scrooge observed that its light was burning high and bright; and dimly connecting that with its influence over him, he seized the extinguisher-cap, and pressed it down upon its head. The Spirit dropped beneath it, so that the extinguisher covered its whole form; but though Scrooge pressed it down with all his force, he could not hide the light, which streamed from under it, in an unbroken flood upon the ground.
He was conscious of being exhausted, and overcome by an irresistible drowsiness; and, further, of being in his own bedroom. He gave the cap a parting squeeze, in which his hand relaxed; and had barely time to reel to bed, before he sank into a heavy sleep.",862.0

The ordinary moved faster than earlier bikes because of its large wheel. The big wheel also caused problems. It was hard to ride up a hill. It was also hard to get on and off the high seat. Riders often fell forward onto their heads when they tried to slow or stop the bike. All these problems made the ordinary dangerous for the rider.
John Starley changed the bicycle in 1885 with the Rover safety bicycle. This bike looked similar to the bicycles of today. Most safety bicycles moved on two wheels of about the same size. A low seat between the wheels made the bike safer and easier to ride. The first safety bicycles had solid rubber tires. Later, air-filled rubber tires were added to the design. They made for a much less bumpy ride!
The safety bicycle used a gear and chain system. A chain connected gears on the back wheel to another gear attached to the pedals. Riders pushed the pedals to turn the back wheel and move the bike. Different- sized gears made it easier to pedal uphill, downhill, or on flat roads. Safety bicycles were less dangerous and more comfortable than earlier bikes. Because of this, more and more people began riding bicycles.
Today’s bikes have the same basic form as the safety bicycle. However, over the years, the design has changed many times. New materials make bikes stronger, faster, and lighter than before.
Every year, people invent new ideas for bicycles. One inventor has designed a bike to ride over both land and water. Another has plans to make a bike from old plastic. Still another hope to build one out of cardboard. The design of bikes will continue to change in interesting ways. Who knows what bikes of the future will look like?",770.0

A rain-fed spring feeds the area. The Inca built a canal that carried this water to fountains. Machu Picchu was also close to an area with lots of rocks. This meant that workers did not have to carry heavy rocks a great distance. It’s still a mystery how the Inca carved the rocks into such perfect bricks. However they did it, experts think it may have taken them many months to complete one wall.
The Inca fit those stones together without using anything to hold them in place. The stones fit very well, too. If you tried to slip a knife between them today, you could not.
The city was divided into two parts. One part was houses and temples, such as the Temple of the Sun. On the first day of winter, sunlight enters a window and shines on a large rock in the middle of the room. Another temple is the Temple of the Three Windows, which also has three walls.
The other part of the city was for growing crops. Here, the Inca built layered gardens on the side of the mountain. They grew crops such as beans, potatoes, and tomatoes.
In the 1500s, explorers from Europe came to South America. They brought illness with them that spread and killed some Inca people. In 1532, a Spanish explorer named Pizarro wanted to take control of the Inca Empire. His soldiers killed many Inca people and their leader. Not long after the Spanish came, the Inca left Machu Picchu. The city fell into ruin.
Although it’s hard to reach, people like to visit Machu Picchu. Once they see the beautiful city, they know their trip was worth it. Today, people work to protect Machu Picchu. They know that this place can teach us about the Inca and their way of life.",786.0
" Large deltas form where big rivers meet oceans.
Sometimes massive amounts of rain and snow fall to Earth, causing streams and rivers to spill over their banks. The land around the streams and rivers floods when this happens. Flooding can cause lots of damage.
When the water recedes to the riverbed, the dirt carried by the floodwater is left on land. Over the years, this dirt forms a floodplain. The soil of a floodplain is rich in nutrients from the river. Crops grow well in floodplains, but can be ruined when water floods the area again.
Rivers and streams have many uses besides carving land. People use rivers for swimming, boating, and fishing. People also have used rivers for thousands of years to transport goods from place to place. Today, large barges and ships move cargo over rivers. Lumber companies move logs from forests to mills over rivers.
Dams built on rivers use the force of water to make electricity. Factories use millions of gallons of water each year to make the things people use. Farms use water to irrigate crops. We use water in our homes to clean and cook. How else do you use water in your home?
Streams and rivers are home to many living things. People and other animals depend on streams and rivers for drinking water. Some industries and large cities dump their waste into rivers, and this waste pollutes the water. Polluted water is harmful to humans, plants, and other animals that live in the water or use it to stay alive.
The force of water running in rivers and streams changes the shape of the land in many ways. Rivers and streams are important to humans, other animals, and plants. Rivers and streams will take care of us as long as we take care of them.",690.0

A king’s tomb held everything he might need in his next life. Some rooms held many things, such as makeup, clothing, and even games. They held everyday items, such as furniture and lamps. They also held plenty of gold, gems, and other treasures.
Scientists think tomb building began as soon as a new king began his rule. Using only simple tools, work crews cut into the hard ground and rock. They cut rough hallways and rooms first, then smoothed the walls, ceiling, and floor.
Workers covered the walls with white plaster. Then, artists drew and painted pictures on the walls. The pictures were the way the people of Egypt wrote thousands of years ago. Sometimes, workers carved pictures on the walls. Then, artists painted in details. All work was checked, and workers fixed anything that wasn’t correct.
No two tombs in the Valley of the Kings are the same, but most have some things in common. Tombs built during the early part of the New Kingdom were usually smaller than later tombs. Often, early plans also included one or two sharp turns. Later tombs were usually built in a straight line.
When a king died, tomb builders had only seventy days to finish their work. Sometimes, though, a tomb wasn’t finished on time. Workers had to leave paintings or rooms half-finished.
Over a million people visit the Valley of the Kings every year. Thousands visit each day. Only eighteen of the tombs are open to visitors. This helps prevent damage to the important paintings and carvings. The eighteen tombs are sometimes closed so every tomb gets “time off” for cleaning and repairs.
So far, sixty-three tombs have been discovered in the Valley of the Kings. However, several New Kingdom tombs have not yet been found. Experts think they are probably located somewhere in the valley.",763.0
" These artists want us to look more closely at the designs of the things we see every day.
Many artists like to use natural objects to make art. Some create huge shapes on beaches using rocks and sand. Others collect beautifully shaped driftwood to build sculptures. Some artists use branches, rocks, and plants to make imaginative shapes in a garden or park.
Installations are entire rooms or buildings that have been made into works of art. The artist fills the room with objects, colors, shapes, sounds, and lights to create a special feeling. Installation artists want you to walk around inside. They want you to look at and touch parts of their room-sized work of art.
The oldest art was painted in caves or scratched into rocks. These very simple images tell stories about what life was like long ago. Scientists digging in ancient ruins find pottery, wall murals, carvings, and tile mosaic floors, and other works by early artists.
Art is everywhere. Explore your town. Find different types of art. Visit museums, galleries, and art fairs where artists show their work.
Look for art. It’s all around you. Find outdoor sculptures in a park and murals you can see while on a walk or a bike ride.
You can make your own art, too. Use colored chalks to draw on sidewalks. Use clay to sculpt shapes. Make a snow sculpture or a sand castle. Glue pieces of shells, stones, and wood to a frame for a favorite photograph.
Art doesn’t have to be serious or hard to do. Art can tell a story, or it can help you say how you feel. Or, it can just be interesting, funny, or beautiful. Art makes our lives more fun. Look, and you will find art all around you. It’s everywhere!",705.0
" This eagle is so big that it can capture a baby gazelle. It usually eats rabbits, squirrels, and birds. Golden eagles and bald eagles live in the open country of western North America. The golden eagle can also be found in Europe, Asia, and northern Africa. Eagles use sticks to build nests that are larger than bathtubs.
Falcons are fast fliers. The peregrine falcon lives in landscapes that range from arctic tundra to tropical rain forest. It is one of the fastest-flying birds of prey. When it dives, it can reach a speed of 322 kilometers (200 mph) per hour. The peregrine falcon usually eats prey that it catches in midair.
You might be surprised to know that vultures are also birds of prey. They are different from hawks and eagles because their prey is dead before they eat it. For this reason, they are known as scavengers. The Cape Griffon vulture of southern Africa feeds small bones to its chicks to make their bones strong.
The turkey vulture of North, Central, and South America benefits people. It removes dead animals so that diseases do not spread. Its sense of smell is so good that the turkey vulture has been used to help people find gas leaks.
Hawks are sharp-eyed hunters. Many hawks can hunt in dense brush because of their long tail and rounded wings. The gray hawk has a beautiful black- and-white banded tail. This bird lives along rivers in Mexico and eats lizards.
Kites are lightweight birds with large wings and a forked tail. The black kite is found in Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia, and elsewhere. The black kite is a scavenger and a predator. Black kites are plentiful because they can eat many different things. Hundreds of them can be seen flying together in some tropical places.",856.0

The Shar-pei is an unusual-looking dog. Its skin is wrinkled and loose, and its mouth is shaped like a hippo’s mouth. The Shar-pei was first bred as a Chinese fighting and guard dog. Its loose skin made it possible for the dog to twist away if another animal grabbed it.
Dalmatian puppies are born completely white. Their spots develop in the first few weeks of life. Dalmatians were trained to trot beside a horse-drawn coach.

" In 1963, Martin helped lead protests and marches in Birmingham. Many of those who marched were children. Police officers sprayed them with powerful fire hoses, and police dogs attacked them. Some children were badly hurt, and many were arrested. After five days, more than 2,000 children filled the jails.
“I Have a Dream”
Sitting at home watching the news, shocked Americans saw the violence in Birmingham. More and more people understood the terrible ways in which blacks were being treated. More and more people wanted equal rights for everyone. When Martin asked people to march on Washington, D.C., more than 250,000 black and white Americans marched with him.
They marched from the Washington Monument to the Lincoln Memorial. They marched for freedom, rights, and respect for all people. The cheering crowd heard Martin give his famous “I Have a Dream” speech. He shared his dream that one day, the color of their skin wouldn’t matter. All people would be “free at last.” The Civil Rights Act, which ended segregation in all public buildings, became a law the next year.
The struggle for equality wasn’t over, though. Many blacks were still poor. Their lives were still hard. Martin kept working for better homes, schools, and jobs for them. In the spring of 1968, he went to help out on a strike held by some garbage workers. (During a strike, workers refuse to work until they win better pay or working conditions.)

" They used large battering rams to hammer away at the castle’s walls and gates. They used weapons called catapults to hurl rocks, debris, and even dead animals or people over the walls. Giant slingshot-like weapons called trebuchets were also used to hurl objects over the walls. And to discourage the castle defenders from rushing out of the castle to attack them, the attackers used giant crossbows mounted on carts.
Many methods were used to keep attackers from entering a castle. Holes were cut into the floors of arches above the castle entrance. Defenders poured burning sand or tar on anyone trying to batter down the gates. Newer castles replaced arrow slits with keyhole-shaped windows where cannons could be placed.
The moat, often filled with water, surrounded the castle. It was difficult to tunnel under a moat, and attackers could not wade across the deep water. There is a myth that crocodiles were placed in some moats. Some moats did have eels and other kinds of fish in them for food, but there were no crocodiles.
Enemies also dug under castle walls to make them collapse. Sometimes they moved large wooden towers against a wall. They then used the towers to climb onto and over the walls. Attackers were known to use portable bridges, or barges, to cross the moat and attack a castle. But often it was not possible to break into a well-built and well-defended castle. So the attackers would simply wait for the castle’s residents to run out of food or water.
Around the 1600s, castles became less and less popular. They were no longer easy to defend because of the use of heavy cannons in warfare. The nobles also wanted more comfortable and open places to live. Still, many castles stand today as a reminder of an age gone by.",971.0
" Since writing was sacred, only scribes and royalty were allowed to learn to read and write.
The design of each square was a source of pride to scribes. They wanted their work to stand out, so they arranged the glyphs in a pleasing way. This made each message uniquely beautiful. It also made reading it a bit difficult since each scribe could write the same thing in a different way.
Just as Egyptian scribes were important to a pharaoh, Mayan scribes were important to tribal kings. Scribes wrote books used in religious ceremonies. Mayan writing was often used to record victories in battle. Monuments and temples had glyphs carved into their stone walls. The messages were written to tell about the ruler’s successes. These displays were a way for rulers to show power.
It was up to the scribes to post these messages in public. This was easy and safe for scribes of a king who won a battle. It was not as easy for scribes when their king lost. The winners of the battle made sure that losing scribes could never write again. Amazing examples of Mayan glyphs can be seen at sites throughout the Yucatan Peninsula.
The beautiful picture languages of the ancient Maya and the Egyptians are no longer used. Many other ancient picture languages, however, are still used today. Asian languages, such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, feature thousands of pictographic symbols. Modern picture languages exist as well. Simple block glyphs appear on signs for international travel. These symbols direct travelers from all parts of the world where to get their bags or catch a bus. It’s much easier to use glyphs than to make signs in many languages. Now, as in the past, a single picture sometimes works just as well as a dozen words!",912.0
" He said she must bring her own apples so she could compare the two. Idun followed Loki out of Asgard. Immediately, the eagle swooped down, seized her, and carried her off to his mountain kingdom. The gods noticed Idun’s absence and began searching for her. Loki admitted to orchestrating Idun’s kidnapping. The gods commanded Loki to bring Idun back to Asgard, threatening to kill him if he failed. Loki knew that Thiassi lived deep in the mountains. He couldn’t reach his lair on foot, so he borrowed a magical cloak of hawk feathers.
Turning into a hawk, he flew to the mountains and found Idun alone in the house of the giant. Thinking quickly, he turned her into a nut and flew away, clutching her in his talons. When the giant returned home, he was enraged to discover Idun gone. He transformed back into an eagle and pursued Loki in his flight. As Loki drew near Asgard, the other gods saw him flying desperately, with the eagle close behind. They stacked up logs around the outer walls. As Loki flew, exhausted, into the palace, the gods lit a fire. The eagle couldn’t stop himself. He flew directly into the wall of flames and was killed. So the gods of Asgard regained their youth and defeated the giant.
Many stories about the Norse gods, like those told here, are tales of conflict between the gods and the giants. The giants represented darkness and winter. The gods battled them constantly to restore light, warmth, and growth. Eventually, the gods faced the giants in a great battle. Some of the gods survived and returned to remake the human race. These Norse stories treat life as a cycle: death and destruction are opportunities to begin anew.",874.0
" If he notices, though, he doesn’t let on. Instead, he just smiles—a kind smile, Rima thinks—and waves goodbye. Afterward, as they pack up, Rima’s mother says, “Habibti. Who is that boy who always talks to you? A friend?” “No,” Rima mumbles. “Just a boy from school.”
That week during recess, Rima is reading on a bench when somebody taps her on the shoulder. She turns, shielding her eyes from the sun. It’s Andy! “I want to show you something,” he says. “Okay,” Rima says. It takes a moment for her brain to shift from reading in Arabic to speaking English. He points to the woods behind the school, and the two walk toward them together. “Look,” Andy says and points again.
Rima gasps. Nestled in some blackberry brambles is a bird’s nest. The two of them look more closely: inside the nest sit four perfectly speckled eggs. “Wow,” Rima breathes. Andy nods. “They really do look just like your baklava,” he whispers. “I wonder if they will all live close to home once they hatch,” Rima says, “or fly far away to somewhere new.” “Birds of a feather flock together,” Andy says.
Rima has never heard the saying before. “What does that mean?” she asks. “It means—it means when you’re friends with someone, you spend time together.” Andy shoves his hands in his pockets. “Rima?” he says. “I know you’re sad to have left your first home behind. But I want you to know that here in your new home, you are...” He pauses shyly. “You are my sadiq ,” he says, at last. “Did I say that right? Sadiq? ” Rima grins. “Of course,” she tells him— and though his Arabic sounds as awkward as ever, she means the words with all her heart. “There’s no wrong way to say friend.”",567.0
" It is usually very hard to wake someone from this deep sleep. This stage lasts for nearly a quarter of sleep time.
REM sleep is quite different from the other stages of sleep. During REM sleep, closed eyes move rapidly from side to side. It’s as if the sleeper is watching a ping-pong match. Brain activity, breathing, and heart rate are almost at waking levels. Instead of resting, the brain is speeding along, yet the sleeper’s body is completely still. Muscles are frozen in place during this stage. Perhaps that is because of the wild dreams that take place during REM sleep.
Many things should happen when our tired head hits the pillow. When they don’t, things can go wrong for us during the day. A lack of sleep can make us cranky and cause us to make more mistakes when working. We also have a hard time solving problems. Our brain doesn’t struggle alone. Studies show that the body has a harder time keeping a steady temperature without enough sleep. Wounds take longer to heal.
Good sleep habits are very important. Try to go to bed and wake up at the same time each day. This helps keep your body on schedule. It also helps if you limit your screen time. Try not to watch television or use a computer, tablet, or smartphone just before bedtime. Don’t exercise right before going to bed. Going for a walk is fine, but anything more could make it hard to fall asleep. If you do have trouble falling asleep, try taking a warm bath or shower. Either one will relax your muscles. Good sleep habits keep the body healthy and the mind sharp. Remember, if you don’t snooze, you just might lose!",722.0
" It seemed that Amelia could not hear the Itasca’ s messages. She spoke of a storm, yet the weather over the island was clear. More than twenty hours into the flight, Amelia’s voice said, “We’re running north and south.” She was never heard from again.
What Happened to Amelia?
This question still haunts people today. The Itasca, along with the U.S. Navy, began searching for Amelia’s plane immediately. The Navy thought she may have gone down in a storm to the northwest of Howland Island. The search continued for weeks. No sign of the plane, Amelia, or Fred was found. After a year of searching, Amelia’s husband, George Putnam, concluded that she had perished at sea. But is that the full story?
Many people have tried to explain what happened to Amelia. Some think Amelia and Fred survived an emergency landing and were picked up by a Japanese ship. They were kept as prisoners on a Japanese island and later died of disease. Others think that Amelia landed the plane, but at a different island. There, she and Fred were able to live on native foods but eventually died of either disease or old age.
Many think these theories are just made up. They believe the most likely answer is that the plane landed in the water. It would have quickly broken apart in the fierce waves, over 10 feet (3 m) high. Perhaps before Amelia and Fred could have inflated their life raft, they drowned. Whatever her fate, there is no doubt that Amelia Earhart is one of the greatest Americans of the 20th century. She died doing what she loved most. She showed everyone that women didn’t have to live with limits. She showed people that anyone could fly. She changed the world. She was a legend.",758.0

Miguel turned in his top five video games list, but he couldn’t decide what the top five games were, so he listed them as a tie. Ashley’s column, “Whitmore Fashion Tips,” was mostly about matching the color of your shirt with the color of your socks. I spent the last twenty minutes of lunch editing her article.
After school, I read over my article one more Bye-Bye, Perry by Noni Lopez We’ve all heard that familiar “bye-bye” echoing down the halls that seems to say, “Please don’t stick your fingers in my cage.” Well, after five years as our school mascot, Perry has said his last “bye-bye.” From now on, he’ll be residing with Eddie, the custodian. “I’m going to make sure Perry gets a restful retirement,” Eddie said... The article went on to include quotes and fond memories from a half-dozen students and teachers. When I’d finished proofing it, I braced myself and handed it over to Ashley and Miguel. To my amazement, they didn’t complain about the photo not being on the cover. I think they just wanted to be done with the paper so they could go back to fixing up their desks. I put the paper together and gave it to Mr. Mann to print. Of course, I wasn’t listed as editor (or even comanager) on the masthead, but I didn’t care. I just wanted to put together a good, factual paper, and in the end, that’s what it was.
This morning we handed out the paper, and people seemed to really like it. Some kids even got inspired and wrote their own stories and cartoons to hang on Perry’s old cage. Ashley and Miguel celebrated by taking off the rest of the day, but I’m rounding up the newspaper contributors. We have to plan next week’s issue!",927.0
" “Move it.” “What’s going—” A loud rumbling interrupts her, and the ground begins to shift. Sarah pulls Jake into the large open dirt area in the center of town. Wood creaks and cracks as the small houses collapse in on themselves, the healthy fires within igniting the walls and roofs. With a loud whoosh, the buildings are completely engulfed in flames that leap into the sky and quickly dissipate, while the fire catches the grass at the edge of town and spreads outward, scorching the fields beyond.
The rumbling stops for a moment, and Jake and Sarah watch the ring of fire spread further and further outward, engulfing everything in its path and burning faster than anything they’d seen before.“Run!” the cat screams, but it’s too late. The ground around them explodes with muffled booms and cracks. Sarah grabs Jake and shields him and the cat from the shower of soil, rocks, and ash. When Sarah releases the two, she’s completely unprepared for what she sees. Surrounding them is a menacing group of what look like octopi, though each has far more than eight tentacles. Some are the size of a fist, while others look as if they could lift a small house. Their bulging heads swell and contract as if they’re breathing, and their tentacles squirm across the ground like snakes on the hunt. The suckers on each wriggly appendage have frightening rows of small, sharp teeth around the edges.
Jake stands frozen in awe, his mouth gaping in an amazed smile. Sarah holds the cat tighter and reaches for Jake’s hand. The world around them is utterly silent.“What do we do now?” she whispers, too frightened to speak normally.“Whatever they want us to,” the cat replies, sounding tense but defeated. “It’s too late. We’re trapped.”",895.0
" Machu Picchu receives a great deal of rainfall. The Inca knew that large amounts of water running downhill could easily erode the soil. Inca engineers designed the agricultural area so rainwater would drain on either side of the terraces and into the forest below.
After Machu Picchu was built and Pachacuti died, the Inca Empire continued to grow. When Huayna (WY-nah) Capac became the new ruler in 1493, he extended the empire farther than ever before. After Huayna Capac died in 1527, his two sons fought over who would become the new leader. Atahualpa (ah-tah-WAHL-pah) won, but in 1532 Spanish explorer Francisco Pizarro arrived. His goal was to take over the Inca Empire. After a surprise attack, many Inca died, and Atahualpa was held for ransom. The Inca offered Pizarro more than 22 metric tons (24 t.) of gold and silver to free Atahualpa. Still, Pizarro ordered Atahualpa killed. People lived in Machu Picchu for only a few decades longer. Some historians think years of fighting and disease brought by Europeans weakened the Inca Empire and caused its decline. After the Inca abandoned Machu Picchu, it remained hidden by trees and vines for centuries. Only a few people who farmed the area were aware of its existence.
Today, Machu Picchu is Peru’s main tourist attraction. Hundreds of thousands of visitors flock to it each year. In 1983, Machu Picchu was named a United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage Site. UNESCO seeks to protect and preserve outstanding historical places. These sites have a special cultural meaning for all of humankind. The group also provides money to help repair and conserve Machu Picchu. Historians continue to learn more about the Inca and Machu Picchu. There are still many mysteries to uncover about this amazing place.",993.0
"” “But Sergeant Rotten Teeth is dangerous to our teeth,” Ashley said. “Part of our book review process is to hear different perspectives about the books in question. If you object to them, Ashley, we’d like to hear why.” “Gladly,” Ashley said. “And Miguel here can say why he thinks the books should stay in the library,” she added. Under his breath, Miguel muttered something in disgust. It sounded like dental hygiene.
That Friday’s Whitmore Weekly was all about the possible book ban. I had coeditor Ashley write a column in support of the ban and coeditor Miguel write one in opposition. I ran Dan Eaton’s email. I ran an interview with Mrs. McGuinness that explained the book review committee process and how students could share their thoughts on what should happen with the books. And I wrote an intro to the entire package that included a quote from former president Lyndon B. Johnson: “Books and ideas are the most effective weapon against intolerance and ignorance.” Before school let out, Mrs. McGuinness told me that she wanted a student on the committee—namely, me.
“There’s one catch,” she said apologetically. “You’ll need to read all twelve books.”“Ten down, two to go,” I said. eee Six weeks later, a shorter follow-up story appeared. Since I’m in the story, Miguel or Ashley really should’ve written it, but Miguel has lost interest in the series, and Ashley was just too mad about the way the vote turned out. I went on to include lots of quotes from people on the board and student reactions, but the story opened with the news itself.

They beat the pots and pans loudly and yelled until they were hoarse. Finally, they stopped, exhausted.
Emily and Elizabeth peeked out of the wagon at the quiet campsite.
“I don’t see anything, do you?” Elizabeth asked.
Emily answered, “No, I think they’re gone.”
The two of them remained in the wagon for a long time after that just to be sure, but there was no sign of the bears.
Finally, Emily said, “Would you like a cup of tea now?”
“Yes, please, but I think I’ll skip the flapjacks,” Elizabeth said.
They looked at each other and collapsed into gales of laughter, relieved that the danger had passed. They left the protection of the wagon, confident that they had chased the bears away.
“Wait!” Emily said. She ran to the wagon and came back carrying pots and pans.
“Just in case,” she said, handing two pans to Elizabeth.
Suddenly, they heard a twig snap and a sound coming toward them. They screamed as loudly as they could and banged on their pots and pans.

" “We should bring poor Snow White back to her father,” the dwarves decided, “since the queen cannot hurt her anymore.” The seven dwarves gently bore the glass coffin through the forest.
At the palace, the king reunited with his queen, who seemed uncommonly serene.
“And where is my daughter?” the king asked.
“Our sweet Snow White ran away,” the queen said, shedding very real-looking tears.
Sobbing, the king lifted his daughter from the coffin. He embraced her so fiercely that the apple in her throat was dislodged. Snow White’s eyelids fluttered. She was alive!
The king and the dwarves were so overjoyed that they did not notice the queen flying up the palace steps to her chamber in a blind rage. She would never be the most beautiful as long as Snow White lived!

Sara almost reeled. When one is faint with hunger the mention of food has sometimes a curious effect. She clutched Ermengarde’s arm. “Do you think—you could ?” she ejaculated. “I know I could,” answered Ermengarde, and she ran to the door—opened it softly—put her head out into the darkness, and listened. Then she went back to Sara. “The lights are out. Everybody’s in bed. I can creep—and creep—and no one will hear.” It was so delightful that they caught each other’s hands and a sudden light sprang into Sara’s eyes. “Ermie!” she said. “Let us pretend ! Let us pretend it’s a party! And oh, won’t you invite the prisoner in the next cell?” “Yes! Yes! Let us knock on the wall now. The jailer won’t hear.” Sara went to the wall. Through it she could hear poor Becky crying more softly. She knocked four times. “That means, ‘Come to me through the secret passage under the wall,’” she explained. “ ‘I have something to communicate.’ ”
Five quick knocks answered her. “She is coming,” Sara said. Almost immediately the door of the attic opened and Becky appeared. Her eyes were red and her cap was sliding off, and when she caught sight of Ermengarde she began to rub her face nervously with her apron. “Don’t mind me a bit, Becky!” cried Ermengarde. “Miss Ermengarde has asked you to come in,” said Sara, “because she is going to bring a box of good things up here to us.” Becky’s cap almost fell off entirely, she broke in with such excitement. “To eat, miss?” she said. “Things that’s good to eat?” “Yes,” answered Sara, “and we are going to pretend a party.” “And you shall have as much as you want to eat,” put in Ermengarde. “I’ll go this minute!”",624.0

My mind is blown.” “That’s it?” Hazel snapped. “That’s all you can say about this?” Malcolm shrugged. “What can we do about it? We leave here in some sort of quiet protest, and we lose our college funding, but we get to keep the moral high ground.” Hazel looked at her feet—like Malcolm, she really needed the funding to afford school. “I guess you could leave and tell the press,” he continued. “The program would likely be shut down, and Buckland Wildlife would be killed in the media. Buckland would likely come after you and your family with the ‘severe’ consequences that lawyer guy talked about.” Hazel’s eyes burned as tears rolled down her cheeks.

" Think about how each shape will look when you unfold your finished snowflake.
Leaving the outside edge uncut, cut out shapes from the other two sides of the triangle. Cut carefully and be sure to leave some of the paper connected so your snowflake will not fall apart!
When you have finished cutting the shapes you want, gently unfold your snowflake. Do you recognize how the shapes you cut out of the edges made the pattern you see now?
Create the basic folds on pages 5 through 7. As you did with the square snowflake, find the edge that will become the outside of your snowflake. That edge should be placed at the top. Cut that edge in an arc. An arc is a curve that is a piece of a circle. Cutting an arc will make your snowflake a circle instead of a square.
Cut shapes out of the other two sides of your triangle. If you want to, you can cut the curved edge, too. Try some of the ideas shown in the diagram on page 11.
Next, let’s change the design of the snowflake’s center by cutting out new shapes. Look at the chart for some ideas, or use your imagination to make up your own.
Create the basic folds on pages 5 through 7. Cut the top edge (the outside) in one of the shapes shown on this page. Then cut the sides and center in any way that seems like fun to you.
Do you want to make smaller snowflakes? Fold a piece of paper in four equal parts, carefully lining up all the edges. Cut along the fold lines. Then use each of the four pieces of paper to make a snowflake. You can tape your snowflakes on windows or use them in many other ways. Have fun!",760.0

Bioluminescent sea animals live in all of Earth’s oceans. Some live near the surface. But most glowing animals live deeper down, from about 200 meters (656 ft) to about 1,000 meters (3,281 ft). Scientists call this area the twilight zone. Sunlight in this middle part of the ocean is a dim blue-green color. Most of the glowing animals in the twilight zone produce a matching blue-green light.
Other glowing sea animals live even deeper down, at the very bottom of the ocean. No sunlight reaches this deep. All the animals that live at this depth are bioluminescent, and they provide the only light in this part of the salty ocean. Only a few kinds of glowing animals make their home on land. Among them are fireflies, glowworms, and the two-colored railroad worm.
Scientists use glowing animals to learn more about nature. They study the way that small glowing animals move through water. Watching these tiny animals helps them learn how larger animals move through water. Scientists also use animal bioluminescence to learn more about diseases, such as cancer.
Oceans cover about seventy percent of Earth’s surface. As a result, oceans are the largest habitat on Earth. When scientists explore new parts of oceans, they discover new kinds of animals. In 2009, scientists found a new kind of glowing animal, a swimming worm. They call it a green bomber. To escape from enemies, green bombers release little balloons of skin filled with a fluid that glows green. The glowing skin confuses enemies, which allows the green bombers to swim away. As scientists explore more parts of Earth’s oceans, they hope to discover more strange new animals that glow in the dark.",900.0

“What would you have? I am the slave of whoever wears the ring.” “Please, return my palace as it was!” “Only the Genie of the Lamp can undo what the Genie of the Lamp has done,” the genie answered. “Then take me to my palace,” Aladdin said. Before he could blink, Aladdin stood at the front door of his palace, which now sat in a lonely desert in Africa. He snuck inside and reunited with his Princess Buddir, and they both shed tears of joy.
“I have a plan to get our lamp back,” whispered Aladdin. He gave Buddir a pouch filled with a potion that made its victims slow and sleepy. Buddir then invited the magician to eat with her. Flattered by her sudden kindness, the magician allowed the princess to pour his drink. She secretly added the powder, and soon the magician was nodding in his soup. “My dear,” said Buddir, “doesn’t it seem awfully dark in here?” The magician’s eyelids were half-closed, so it did seem dark to him. “Why yes, it does,” he mumbled.
“Why don’t you give me that old lamp you carry around, so we may dine by its flame?” The magician, numbed by the potion, handed her the magic lamp. She summoned the genie immediately. “Take me and Aladdin and my palace back to the Sultan’s kingdom, and leave this horrid magician in the desert where he will never find his way out!” she ordered.

" By the time a tsunami reaches land, it is tall enough to destroy almost anything in its path.
The largest tsunami ever recorded happened when an earthquake caused a landslide along the coast of Alaska. But this wave was in a very small bay, only a short distance from the landslide that caused it. Most tsunamis are between one and ten stories high when they reach the shore. That might not sound very high, but it is hard to imagine the power of this much moving water. Most coastal towns and villages are much less than 30 meters (100 ft) above the sea. Even a small tsunami can destroy houses, streets, and entire towns. A tsunami caused by a volcano in Indonesia killed 36,000 people in 1883.
Like volcanoes, tsunamis are becoming easier to predict. They usually do not hit the shore until a few minutes to a few hours after the earthquake or volcano that causes them. Scientists have instruments that detect volcanoes and earthquakes. When a large one happens, scientists have time to warn people that a tsunami may be coming. Unfortunately, the system cannot warn people in time to save their homes or belongings. But they do have time to save their lives, which is the most important thing.
Our quiet planet occasionally turns violent. During a large earthquake, the ground shakes, destroying homes and property. In an explosive volcanic eruption, liquid rock, poisonous gases, ash, and landslides can bury cities. And tsunamis can cause billions of dollars in damage along coastlines. Scientists are trying to learn as much as they can about these violent events. As they learn more, scientists can predict volcanoes, earthquakes, and tsunamis in order to save thousands of lives.",947.0
" He ran toward the pond as fast as his legs could carry him and leaped into the air in a marvelous grand split. Flying high through the air, he snatched up the baby. His fantastic leap and split was so fast and so high that it carried him over the pond. He looked down to see the hungry crocs with their large jaws wide open. He landed gracefully on the other side, holding the baby safely in his arms.
People all around clapped and cheered, “Hooray for the hero!” Ricardo couldn’t believe it. A bulky man with bushy hair ran toward him as he held the baby tightly. “Thank you, thank you, my lad, for saving my baby’s life,” he cried. “How can I ever repay you? I insist on throwing a party in your honor. Tell all your family and friends to be sure to come. The whole city will be invited! No expense will be spared.

Ricardo looked straight into the camera and, speaking into the microphone, replied proudly, “Ballet! I love to dance.” From that moment on, the secret was out. But he wasn’t embarrassed. Instead, he was quite happy that he no longer had to keep his love of ballet a secret. And no one ever made fun of his love of dance.",709.0
" Many animals have built-in sounding systems to help them navigate and find food.
Bats use a technique called echolocation. They send out sound waves that are reflected back by insects, trees, or other objects. When the waves bounce off objects and come back to the bats, the waves are a different frequency. This technique allows bats to find food at night when they hunt. Dolphins also use sonar to help them find their way around the ocean. Sound waves also are used to take pictures inside a human body. Using ultrasound, doctors can see a baby inside its mother’s body before it is born. As with sonar, sound waves reflect off the baby and return at a different frequency.
Musical instruments have been created from experiments with different types of sounds. A famous group called Stomp uses garbage cans, brooms, and pipes to make music. Once they even danced on top of an old school bus as part of a concert. Sounds can make people feel strong emotions. Even a kitten purring or a mother humming to her baby can create feelings of calm and love. People can describe their experiences based on sounds. If someone talks about the ocean, you can almost hear the water crashing on the beach. Or you might hear sea gulls squawking or squeals of delight from other beach-goers.
The world is filled with sound energy caused by objects vibrating all around us. Many kinds of sound waves moving through the air cause sounds that may be loud or soft, high or low, pleasant or annoying. Pay close attention and discover new sounds that can provide information about the world around you. Sound helps to explain things, gives details about settings and objects, and creates emotions and feelings. Think about all the ways sound enters your life.",866.0
" About seventy-five years later, Louis Pasteur discovered how to weaken microbes. Like Dr. Jenner’s use of cowpox, his discovery led to the use of weakened microbes to make several types of vaccines. These vaccines could fight specific diseases. They could be made in large quantities, so many people could be vaccinated against a disease at one time. Almost all children are given shots of vaccines before they start school. A flu shot is a vaccine. Many people get a flu shot every year to prevent a flu infection.
Scientists discovered that some helpful microbes are natural fighters. These special microbes naturally produce strong medicines called antibiotics. Anti means “against.” These helpful microbes fight certain harmful microbes and kill them. Antibiotics are very particular and attack only the cells infected by harmful microbes. They don’t harm healthy cells or destroy other, helpful, microbes. Your doctor might prescribe an antibiotic to stop an infection. Antibiotics work well. But sometimes, a strong microbe fights back. An antibiotic may not stop an infection for several reasons. A microbe might change itself just enough so that the antibiotic doesn’t recognize it. Also, an antibiotic might fail because that type has been used too often. Microbes may have learned about it already—and how to resist it. And some antibiotics have been used in the wrong way. Scientists keep trying to produce new, better antibiotics to fight stronger microbes.
Microbes live in, on, and around almost everything. Most microbes are harmless. But harmful ones cause disease. Scientists and doctors around the world are trying to control or eliminate diseases. We know that we can never wipe out all of the world’s harmful microbes. But we can learn how to help control them and how to be healthier.",860.0
" Sailing a ship also was hard work. Muscle power was all the pirates had to rely on to do the work. Sails had to be raised and lowered as conditions changed and to keep the ship moving fast. Teamwork was important. Pirates slept below the deck in the ship’s hold. Quarters were usually cramped, with each crewman having very little space. They kept their personal property in a sea chest. They slept in hammocks. When the weather was good, pirates would often sleep on deck.
Pirate ships usually had a population of rats. The rats chewed sails and ropes and ate food supplies. Rats were even known to chew through a ship’s hull and sink a ship. Food aboard a pirate ship was nothing to get excited about. They had very little fresh meat. When they did, it was usually turtle meat. If the fish were biting, pirates ate fresh fish. Otherwise meals consisted of dry, salted meat and dry biscuits. All of this was usually washed down with beer, wine, or water. Ships usually had very poor cooking facilities. Pirates ate off of metal plates. If they were lucky, they had a fork or spoon. Otherwise they just used their fingers. Pirates were not known for their good manners.
Most pirate ships were small and fast. Early ships were powered by oars. But by the 1700s most pirate ships were powered by the wind. But even these sailing ships were sleek, fast, and easy to steer. They were shallow so they could escape their enemies and enter shallow ports. Life aboard a pirate ship was not very pleasant. Conditions were often dirty and crowded. The work had to be done by the pirates themselves, except in earlier times when slaves did the work.",643.0

“You’ve done it!” the professor cheered. “You’ve scared away the mighty beasts!” Miguel rushed over to the professor. “You’re safe!” he cried. “Thanks to you and Hans!” the professor said. “Now untie my bonds, Harry, before that giant returns!” Miguel glanced around in hopes of finding a stone tool or weapon when he remembered what he had in his pocket. He gently pulled out the dagger he’d found on the Great Gallardo’s chest and cut the palm twine that held the professor down. A lightbulb clicked on inside Miguel’s head. It’s like the book knows what I’ll need to make things right!
Professor Von Hardwigg bear-hugged Miguel. “You were right, Harry,” Professor Von Hardwigg said. “Nothing is worth risking our lives, not even the most astonishing discovery. Let’s go home.” Home sounded wonderful. Miguel handed the dagger to the professor. “Here is something you can take home with you.” “Is that what I think it is?” the professor gasped. “Could it be the famous dagger of Arne Saknussemm, the first explorer to reach the center of the Earth?” Hans looked at the dagger in awe at the mention of the fellow Icelander’s name. As Miguel let go of the dagger, he closed his eyes. In seconds, a cool breeze met him back at the loft, safe and sound. Miguel breathed a sigh of relief. Now he had witnessed first-hand how dangerous and overwhelming the power of discovery could be. Explorers were brave and smart, but often blinded by the perceived glory of their discovery. Miguel was glad he’d saved the professor, but for now, Miguel was content to discover each day of his own life—right here and right now, with, of course, a little help from the Great Gallardo’s books every now and then!",733.0
" Who is that boy who always talks to you? A friend?” “No,” Rima mumbles. “Just a boy from school.”
That week during recess, Rima is reading on a bench when somebody taps her on the shoulder. She turns, shielding her eyes from the sun. It’s Andy! “I want to show you something,” he says. “Okay,” Rima says tentatively. It takes a moment for her brain to shift from reading in Arabic to speaking English. He points to the woods behind the school, and the two walk toward them together. “Look,” Andy says and points again.
Rima gasps, “No way!”—an American phrase that Andy has taught her in exchange for teaching him. Nestled in some blackberry brambles is a bird’s nest. “Yes way,” he laughs. The two of them peer more closely: inside the nest sit four perfectly speckled eggs. “Wow,” Rima breathes. “Ush el bulbul.” Andy nods. “They really do look just like your baklava,” he whispers. “I wonder if they will all live close to home once they hatch,” Rima says, “or fly far away to somewhere new.” “Birds of a feather flock together,” Andy says.
Rima has never heard the saying before. “What does that mean?” she asks. “It means—it means when you’re friends with someone, you spend time together.” Andy shoves his hands in his pockets. “Rima?” he says. “I know you’re sad to have left your first home behind... but I want you to know that here in your new home, you are...” He pauses shyly. “You are my sadiq, ” he says, at last. “Did I say that right? Sadiq? ” Rima grins. “Of course,” she tells him—and though his Arabic sounds as awkward as ever, she means the words with all her heart. “Of course you did. There’s no wrong way to say friend. ”",617.0
" “That was my mom and my little brother.” I didn’t even know Del had a little brother, and now I felt even worse. “Oh,” I said, “I just want to apologize for saying something so mean.” “My dad got hurt,” Del said, finally looking at me as if he was challenging me. “He was deployed overseas in the Army. Mom was telling us that they’re going to send him home.”
“Will he be okay?” I asked quietly. Del’s angry face softened a bit. “Yeah. My brother was just scared.” He shrugged. “Not that anyone will believe the truth, now that they think I beat him up.” Anger crept back into his face. “I’m really sorry to hear about your dad, and I’m glad he’ll be okay.” “Okay, Jamie,” he said with a shrug. It was the first time he’d used my real name in months. I almost smiled. He returned to watching the game as my friend pulled me away. “Why are you talking to him?” May asked. “You don’t want to be friends with a kid beater.” “None of that’s true,” I said, “and we shouldn’t keep gossiping about it.”
“You said the kid looked like he’d been beaten up,” May retorted. “That’s what you told us,” Cassie said. “I did,” I said, “and that was wrong. I shouldn’t have made those assumptions because none of them were true. I was talking to Del because I was apologizing for gossiping about him when I didn’t know the truth.” Cassie, Matt, and May all looked at each other sheepishly, and I could tell they were thinking about the assumptions they had made about Del. “What did happen, then?” asked Cassie. “If you really want to know, ask Del,” I said, feeling much better. “I’m done talking behind other people’s backs.”",535.0
" Sara went to it and sat down. She seldom cried. She did not cry now. She laid Emily across her knees and put her face down upon her and her arms around her, and sat there, her little black head resting on the black draperies, not saying one word, not making one sound.
And as she sat in this silence there came a low tap at the door—such a low, humble one that she did not at first hear it, and, indeed, was not roused until the door was timidly pushed open and a poor tear-smeared face appeared peeping round it. It was Becky’s face, and Becky had been crying furtively for hours and rubbing her eyes with her kitchen apron until she looked strange indeed.
“Oh, miss,” she said under her breath. “Might I—would you allow me—jest to come in?” Sara lifted her head and looked at her. She tried to begin a smile, and somehow she could not. Suddenly—and it was all through the loving mournfulness of Becky’s streaming eyes—Sara’s face looked more like a child’s, not so much too old for her years. She held out her hand and gave a little sob. “Oh, Becky,” she said. “I told you we were just the same—only two little girls—just two little girls. You see how true it is. There’s no difference now. I’m not a princess anymore.” Becky ran to her and caught her hand, and hugged it to her breast, kneeling beside her and sobbing with love and pain. “Yes, miss, you are,” she cried, and her words were all broken. “Whats’ever ’appens to you—whats’ever—you’d be a princess all the same—an’ nothin’ couldn’t make you nothin’ different.”",887.0
" Then, suddenly, he slipped off the curb. “Are you okay?” Melinda gasped. “You were dancing so well.” Takehito was down on the street, clutching his ankle, which was swelling up fast. Manny flipped open his cooler and scooped some ice into a small bag. He gave it to Melinda, who handed it to Takehito. He pressed the bag of ice onto his swollen ankle and winced. “I think that’s all for today,” said Manny, worried. Melinda turned off the music.
Takehito stood behind the curtain backstage, nervously wringing out his hands and feeling as though birds were twittering around in his stomach. Melinda seemed to be feeling just the opposite as she walked around, laughing and saying hello to her former teachers. Then Mrs. Klein came by to inform the couple that they were to perform next. Takehito lifted up his pant leg to see that his ankle was still a bit swollen. He imagined his ankle returning to its normal size, the curtains opening, and the entire student body staring at him, pointing and laughing. He stepped to the center of the stage, slowly and deliberately, his spurs pinging with each step, his hat covering his face. All went still. Then he shot up his head as the spotlight flashed on him and the music fired. Melinda came running toward him, and suddenly they were in rhythm, stride-for-stride, in synch, banging out a fierce tango. The crowd screamed wildly... then the curtains opened.
“Now Takehito will perform the tango with his partner, Melinda,” said Mrs. Klein over the microphone. The two got into position. The music began and they waited for the right beat. “Are you ready, cowboy?” Takehito smiled, knowing that he had made at least one friend.",780.0
" It was almost dark under the trees, for the branches shut out the daylight; but the travelers did not stop, and went on into the forest. “If this road goes in, it must come out,” said the Scarecrow, “and as the Emerald City is at the other end of the road, we must go wherever it leads us.” “Anyone would know that,” said Dorothy. “Certainly; that is why I know it,” returned the Scarecrow. “If it required brains to figure it out, I never should have said it.” After an hour or so the light faded away, and they found themselves stumbling along in the darkness. Dorothy could not see at all, but Toto could, for some dogs see very well in the dark; and the Scarecrow declared he could see as well as by day. So she took hold of his arm and managed to get along fairly well.
“If you see any house, or any place where we can pass the night,” she said, “you must tell me; for it is very uncomfortable walking in the dark.” Soon after the Scarecrow stopped. “I see a little cottage at the right of us,” he said, “built of logs and branches. Shall we go there?” “Yes, indeed,” answered the child. “I am all tired out.” So the Scarecrow led her through the trees until they reached the cottage, and Dorothy entered and found a bed of dried leaves in one corner. She lay down at once, and with Toto beside her soon fell into a sound sleep. The Scarecrow, who was never tired, stood up in another corner and waited patiently until morning came.",865.0
" The Master stood stunned and scratched his head. Finally, he said, “I wanted to put the pigs in slings, but someone said my idea was cruel.” The judges looked shocked and unhappy. The Master walked off the stage feeling defeated. “Looks like we have one more presenter this year,” the judges said. “Is there a Meegor here?” Meegor stood up and took the stage with his potted plants. He was nervous at first, but as he explained how he had followed every step of the scientific method to reach his final conclusions, it became easier. He told them how the right mixture of manure and slop made the plants healthier and made them produce more. “I call this mixture ‘fertilizer!’” he said at the end. The judges asked him questions. Some he had the answers for, some he didn’t. “I don’t know,” he would say when he didn’t know the answer. “I can do an experiment to find out.”
The judges talked with each other for barely a minute before they announced that Meegor was the winner. Everyone cheered loudly, except the Master. “You’re still my assistant,” the Master said as they rode home later, Meegor holding his trophy, “and you stole the name of my discovery!” Meegor didn’t say anything. He rode along, smiling, knowing that he had used the scientific method to discover something that would help people for many years to come.",783.0
" He was at the rendezvous. They paused and stood, expectant.
There was a silence. Finally, the chest of the doomed soldier began to heave with a strained motion. It increased in violence. This spectacle made the youth squirm and he saw something in his friend’s eyes that made him sink wailing to the ground. He raised his voice in a last supreme call. “Jim—Jim—Jim—” The tall soldier opened his lips and spoke. He made a gesture. “Leave me be—don’t tech me—leave me be—” There was another silence while he waited. Suddenly his form stiffened and straightened. Then it was shaken by a prolonged ague. He stared into space. To the two watchers there was a curious and profound dignity in the firm lines of his awful face. His tall figure stretched itself to its full height. There was a slight rending sound. Then it began to swing forward, slow and straight, in the manner of a falling tree. A swift muscular contortion made the left shoulder strike the ground first.
The body seemed to bounce a little way from the earth. “God!” said the tattered soldier. The youth had watched, spellbound, this ceremony at the place of meeting. His face had been twisted into an expression of every agony he had imagined for his friend. He now sprang to his feet and, going closer, gazed upon the lifeless face, with its open mouth. As the flap of the blue jacket fell away from the body, he could see that the side looked as if it had been chewed by wolves. The youth turned, with sudden, livid rage, toward the battlefield. He shook his fist. He seemed about to deliver a philippic. “Hell—” The red sun was pasted in the sky like a wafer.",675.0

He threaded the mazes of the tangled forest with a strange fortune.
In encounters with guards and patrols he displayed the keenness of a detective and the valor of a gamin. Obstacles fell before him and became of assistance. The youth, with his chin still on his breast, stood woodenly by while his companion beat ways and means out of sullen things. The forest seemed a vast hive of men buzzing about in frantic circles, but the cheery man conducted the youth without mistakes, until at last he began to chuckle with glee and self-satisfaction. “Ah, there yeh are! See that fire?” The youth nodded stupidly. “Well, there’s where your reg’ment is. An’ now, good-by, ol’ boy, good luck t’ yeh.” A warm and strong hand clasped the youth’s languid fingers for an instant, and then he heard a cheerful and audacious whistling as the man strode away.

A man grilling meat in his front yard offered Sam some tasty barbecue. Sam ran over and happily ate it, licking the sauce off his snout. He liked it so much that he begged for more. The man laughed and gave him a second piece.
Sam waved his paw to thank the people in the armed forces and the veterans as he passed. They saluted him in return and cheered.
The mayor even walked up and shook Sam’s paw. “What day in July is the birthday of the United States?” the mayor asked. Sam barked four times for the Fourth of July!
“I don’t think anyone has been this excited since the Founding Fathers signed the Declaration of Independence in 1776!” the mayor exclaimed. Sam ran in circles around the mayor to prove he really was excited, and everyone laughed.
The parade made a lot of noise as it followed Sam through the town. Sam seemed to enjoy hearing it all because his tail kept wagging. He jumped, barked, and played as if he were a puppy again.
They had almost reached the park where the parade was supposed to end when, suddenly, some fireworks exploded. The people cheered, but Sam didn’t like the loud bangs. He ran all the way home to get away from them.
The people wondered why the Grand Marshal was running away. The parade followed Sam all the way to his backyard. It had grown dark during the walk, and before they could look around, fireworks started to fill the night sky.

" President Clinton asked her to lead a group to improve the U.S. health care system. Congress and many Americans disliked the plan, though. It did not win enough support to become a law.
Some Americans felt Hillary Clinton was too outspoken as first lady. Still, Bill Clinton was re-elected president in 1996. The first lady put her energy into fighting for the rights of women and children. The Clintons faced many challenges while Bill was president. They worked together to get through them. Bill Clinton’s political career was ending. Hillary Clinton’s was just beginning.
In 2000, Hillary Clinton ran to be a U.S. senator for New York. She won easily. She became the first female senator from that state. On September 11, 2001, terrorists attacked New York City. Senator Clinton worked to help the city after the attacks. She was re-elected in 2006.
The next year, Clinton announced that she was running for U.S. president. Her chances seemed good. Her race against Barack Obama to become the Democratic nominee was very close. Obama barely beat her. He then won the presidency with Clinton’s help.
President Obama named Hillary Clinton to be his secretary of state, a very important job. Secretary Clinton was in charge of U.S. relations with other countries. She traveled to meet leaders in 112 countries. Clinton left the job in 2013. She wanted to try to become president one more time.
In April 2015, Hillary Clinton told Americans that she was running for U.S. president again. She gave many speeches across the country. In November, Americans cast their votes.

" Together, Katie and her father gathered all their trash into a plastic bag. “Where is the garbage can?” she asked. Smiling, her father said, “There is no garbage can up here—we need to pack out everything we carried in.” “But I don’t have any room left in my backpack!” she said, showing him. Her father frowned and said, “Katie, you need to take all that out and leave it here.” Katie stared at him in horror. Leave it here? But it was her collection!
Katie’s father sat down on a rock, patting the space beside him, and reluctantly, Katie sat. Displaying the pinecone and the acorns, he explained, “These are food for birds and small animals like the chipmunk you saw. How would you feel if someone snatched your lunch for a souvenir ?” Picturing the chipmunk dashing away with her school lunchbox, Katie admitted, laughing, “I guess I wouldn’t like that very much.”
When her father pulled the next article out of her backpack, Katie grimaced. “That flower was so pretty when I picked it!” she said. “If you leave it where it’s growing, it will look just as pretty on the way back down,” her father said. “Not only that, but as it grows and dies, it will spread its seeds. The seeds will make more flowers next year.” Only one item remained—the smooth round stone with the white streak, which Katie’s father said was quartz.
“I’ll put that stone back into the stream,” she said. “Anyway, I still have the rest of my collection!” Peering into the empty pack, her father said, “You mean there’s more?” “Oh, yes,” Katie said, “but it’s too big to bring home in my backpack. So I’ll keep it all right here.”",610.0

At the 1936 Olympics, 18-year-old Fanny Koen came in a disappointing sixth place in the high jump. She knew she would do better next time. Unfortunately, she had to wait 12 years for her chance. The Olympics were not held in 1940 or 1944 because of World War II.
By the next Olympics in 1948, Fanny Blankers-Koen was 30. She was married and the mother of two children. She was also determined. People told her to stay home with her family—she didn’t listen. Instead, she won the 100-meter, 200-meter, and 100-meter relay races. She also won the 80-meter hurdles. No woman had won four gold medals in one Summer Olympics before. Many people thought Fanny could have won six gold medals. At that time, she held the world record in the long jump and high jump. But Olympic rules then did not let women enter more than three individual events.
The crowd at the 1976 Olympics roared with delight. A little 14-year-old girl in a ponytail showed unusual grace and agility on the uneven bars. Everyone in the audience knew Nadia Comaneci (co-MAN-eech) had done a great job. How good was she? The scoreboard showed a 1.0, but that’s because it wasn’t made to show a 10. She was perfect! A 10 is the highest score in a gymnastics event. Never before had anyone earned a perfect 10.
Nadia continued to charm the judges and audience during the Olympic Games. She scored six more 10s in other gymnastic events. She won three gold, one silver, and one bronze medal. She was also named all-around Olympic champion. At the 1980 Olympics, Nadia added two gold and two silver medals to her trophy case.",805.0
" If too much sugar keeps coming into the body, more fat is produced. A body that has too much fat is at risk for health problems. Extra pounds strain bones and muscles. The heart has to work hard to pump blood through a larger body. Fat can also clog blood vessels, forcing the heart to work even harder to push blood through them.
Eating too much sugar is a concern for everyone. People who have a condition known as diabetes ( dy-uh-BEE-teez ) must be especially careful about eating sugar. Their bodies have trouble processing sugar in the blood. Sugar levels in the blood can easily go too high or too low. These changes can harm organs like the kidneys and the heart.
So how can people guard against eating too much sugar? One way is to eat more natural food and less prepared food. Naturally sweet fruits like grapes and peaches don’t have any added sugar. It’s also easier to keep tabs on sugar by eating homemade meals instead of prepared food. Cooking at home gives people more control over what goes into the food they eat.
Another way to limit sugar is to read labels on packaged foods. Most food labels have a list of ingredients. The ingredients are listed in order by the amount present in the food. If sugar is one of the first few ingredients listed, the product probably has plenty of it. People can compare labels on products to see which ones have more or less added sugar.
Sugar makes food delicious, sweet, and tasty. It’s what fuels our bodies and keeps us going. Too much sugar can also slow us down if we’re not careful. That’s why it’s important to pay attention to what we eat. Sugar can be almost anywhere!",881.0

“You must miss it there,” Andy says, and suddenly Rima’s eyes fill with tears. Ashamed, she ducks her head. Andy just smiles, though—a kind smile, Rima thinks.

Mar was still enraged: “If you stand in my way, then I will kill you, too.” Quartang wasn’t very fond of the idea of dying, but he had promised to defend Tatkanna as best he could. Mar lunged at him and the two fought for several minutes. Mar was much bigger and stronger than Quartang and easily defeated him. Quartang retreated to the trees to save his own life.
But Mar had had enough fighting. He was very sad and depressed. He glanced at the small pile of wood the tribe had set on fire as he walked away. Whenever the tribal people see a Cockatoo, they remember how fire was stolen from him.
The tribe was very pleased with the bravery of Tatkanna. They prepared a great feast for the celebration and invited some of the local tribes to the corroboree. With fire, they could dance late into the night and sing until the dawn. They gladly shared their gift of fire with their neighbors.
Tatkanna was the center of attention. But he was shy and missed his friend Quartang, who would not come out of the trees because he felt ashamed of losing the fight. Tatkanna told him it was all right, that he still loved his friend. But Quartang still refused to leave the trees, and he has never left the trees since that day.

" The king said the defeat was not his fault.
In the years after the American Revolution, the king started acting strangely. He seemed nervous all the time, said odd things, and was confused. He shouted at others and pushed them. Doctors helped the king using the latest treatments. Over time, the king seemed to get better. He returned to his leadership role.
King George soon faced more challenges, including another war with France. By 1799, France had a new leader—Napoleon Bonaparte. Napoleon wanted to take over Europe, including Great Britain. King George did not want to lose his country. Great Britain and France fought until 1815, when France lost the war. At the same time, a fight started in Ireland. People there felt that Great Britain passed unfair religious laws. The Irish started a rebellion, but Great Britain defeated them.
King George III was in his fiftieth year as king in 1809, and the country celebrated. The joy would not last long, however. In 1810, the king’s youngest daughter died, which left George heartbroken. George again became mentally and physically ill. The king was unable to finish his royal duties. Parliament allowed Prince George, his son, to rule Great Britain in 1811. In January 1820, King George III died, and his son became King George IV.
During his time in power, King George III lost the war with America and slowly became mentally ill. For a long time, many historians thought he was a bad king. Recently, they have changed their opinions of him. George III won two major wars—the Seven Years’ War and the wars with Napoleon. He served as king for sixty years, and he led his country to greatness. Through it all, he remained a good husband and father, and he always put his country first.",800.0
" “Wait!” said my Aunt Dee. “Let’s give Charly’s garden a chance. If no one likes it, I promise to pay for two special rare flower gardens and a new playground for the park. I’ll even pay for a plaque. We can name the new playground . . . Rooneyland.”
Despite some harrumphing, Mr. Rooney and his nose seemed to be totally in joint with Aunt Dee’s offer. My New Year’s revolution had officially begun. Now, if only I could get the weather to cooperate. I made a tiny error in planting my garden when I did. The whole town was in the middle of a drought. It had not rained for six weeks. According to the local TV news, the reservoirs that hold our drinking water were “dangerously low.”
“Let everyone drink soda pop instead,” I said, but nobody listened. Anyone watering his or her garden would get a fine. Now, you might think that something named “fine” is a good thing. But it is not. Gattie told me a fine means you have to pay money for doing something against the rules. That sounds more like an UNfine if you ask me. So, with no rain, and no watering allowed, it looked as if my New Year’s revolution garden would never grow. It wouldn’t bring a smile to anyone’s face, except maybe Mr. Rooney’s, who would get two rare flower gardens and a playground with his name on a plaque. I didn’t want to water my garden and pay an UNfine. Plus, it was wrong to waste water during a drought. What my garden needed was rain. But with no rain headed my way, I’d have to come up with another solution.

" I discovered they were finding crumbs on my floor and in my bed. Then, they were carrying the crumbs near the window, where they escaped between the woodwork and the wall. I went outside and tried to find them coming out of the house. I saw many ants, but none were carrying crumbs of cookies. Maybe they lived under the house! Maybe they lived in the walls! I decided I needed to confess to Gram.
I told Gram about the ants and even about the cookie crumbs. I also said that I did not want to hurt them, I just wanted to get them off my bed. I asked Gram if I could use her vacuum to sweep up the crumbs in my room. I also asked if I could move the bed. I cleaned my room, changed the sheets, and scooted my bed closer to the window. I vowed not to eat cookies in my room anymore. I wondered if this would end my ant problems.
As I lay in my bed that night, I thought about all of the ants that had been crawling in my room. I decided to ask Gram if I could put some honey on the ground under my bedroom window to feed the ants since I’d taken away their food source. I closed my eyes with a smile on my face.

" Another popular site is the Valley of the Kings in southern Egypt, near the city of Luxor. Some of Egypt’s most famous pharaohs were buried there in more than sixty tombs. Many of the treasures from the tombs were stolen by robbers long ago. The tomb of Tutankhamun (toot-an-KAH-muhn) still had its treasures when it was discovered in 1922. Many of these amazing treasures now sit in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. Near the Valley of the Kings are other ruins of great temples built by the pharaohs.
People in Egypt raise many animals, such as sheep, goats, donkeys, and water buffalo. Some people also raise and use camels for work. Some wild animals live in the harsh desert environments. Many of them only come out at night when the air is cooler. One desert animal is the fennec, a small fox with large ears. The fennec spends most of its day underground in a burrow. It comes out at night to find food. Many snakes, lizards, and scorpions also live in the desert. One type of lizard is the spiny-tailed lizard. The ibex (EYE-beks), a type of goat, is another desert animal. The Nile and its valley are also home to many kinds of animals. Fish swim in the river, and crocodiles can be found in the southern part of the Nile.
Egypt is an amazing country filled with treasures. Both animals and people live in its deserts. The Nile River cuts through the country, dividing the deserts into two parts. It is a source of water and good farmland for millions of people. Millions of tourists visit Egypt each year to learn about its fascinating past and see ancient landmarks. This history, along with its people and animals, makes Egypt a fantastic place to learn about.",813.0

This thing couldn’t be talking about my uncle—could it?“I’m not cleaning up any mess that beast created. If you’re in there, open the door,” the thing continues, tentacles flailing.“Jasper’s not here!” I blurt out. The thing stops moving for a moment, then it shrieks, “Thief! Burglar!

Scientists think they have the best opportunity to find evidence of life inside this crater. That’s because scientists believe Gale Crater was once flooded with water. As a result, the crater is packed with clays and sulfates—types of minerals. These minerals are byproducts of water. Curiosity will study the soil to see if any microbes are hiding inside.
Driving Curiosity is a hard job; one bad turn could doom the mission. That’s why Heverly meets with scientists to talk about where the rover should go before he gets behind the wheel or, in this case, the computer.
Once in the driver’s seat, Heverly must put on special glasses to study the 3-D images that Curiosity sends back. He then uses a computer program that simulates the route. Heverly enters hundreds of computer commands that steer the craft. Curiosity crawled only thirty feet a day when it first landed.

Talking to Curiosity is more complicated than picking up a smartphone and calling a friend. The rover can send messages directly to Earth. It can also relay signals by using three satellites orbiting Mars.
Scientists send and receive the signals using a system of giant antenna dishes (see diagram). The system is called the Deep Space Network. The huge dishes are located near Madrid, Spain; Canberra, Australia; and the Mojave Desert in California.

" Charlotte woke to the morning light without knowing when she had fallen asleep. She waited until she was sure that Father had left for the day, and then she raced downstairs to the kitchen, only to find her mother calmly washing breakfast dishes.
“I saved you some oatmeal,” she said. “You must be starved.” Over reheated cereal, Charlotte learned of her mother’s sacrifice. She had promised Father she would quit suffrage work forever and she would never vote, even if it became legal. “But Mama...” “It’s all right, dear; I knew this was likely to happen when I picked up that protest sign.” Charlotte began to tremble. “That’s why you were so against public demonstrations—because you didn’t want Father to find out. Oh Mama, this is all my fault.” “Now, don’t you start crying. It is not your fault. The movement is going public, and I just couldn’t hide anymore.” Mama washed out the sink and dried her hands on a kitchen towel. “There is one good thing,” she said. “This arrangement applies only to me—not to you.” Charlotte got the message; she would not quit. She would fight for a world like the one Mrs. Pierce described—where being a person came before being a woman, and she would vote. Someday, she would vote.
Mrs. Pierce arrived at the courthouse in the same green Town Car. It was nicked in a few places, but otherwise had borne the years well, and so, for that matter, had its owner. Mrs. Pierce’s hair was whiter and her wrinkles deeper, but her eyes still twinkled when she smiled. “We made it, my little namesake,” she said. “Now, let’s hurry and vote. At my age, it’s not wise to dawdle.”",730.0
" “Call the next witness!” said the King. The next witness was the Duchess’s cook. She carried the pepper-box in her hand. Alice guessed who it was, even before she got into the court, by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once. “Give your evidence,” said the King. “Shan’t,” said the cook. The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a low voice, “Your Majesty must cross-examine this witness.” “Well, if I must, I must,” the King said, with a melancholy air. After folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, “What are tarts made of?” “Pepper, mostly,” said the cook. “Treacle,” said a sleepy voice behind her. “Collar that Dormouse,” the Queen shrieked out. “Behead that Dormouse! Turn that Dormouse out of court! Suppress him! Pinch him! Off with his whiskers!” For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the Dormouse turned out, and, by the time they had settled down again, the cook had disappeared. “Never mind!” said the King, with an air of great relief. “Call the next witness.” And he added in an undertone to the Queen, “Really, my dear, you must cross-examine the next witness. It quite makes my forehead ache!”
Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list, feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like, “—for they haven’t got much evidence yet, ” she said to herself. Imagine her surprise, when the White Rabbit read out, at the top of his shrill little voice, the name “Alice!”",699.0
" Ah! You may look through that shirt till your eyes ache; but you won’t find a hole in it, nor a threadbare place. It’s the best he had, and a fine one too. They’d have wasted it, if it hadn’t been for me.” “What do you call wasting of it?” asked old Joe. “Putting it on him to be buried in, to be sure,” replied the woman with a laugh. “Somebody was fool enough to do it, but I took it off again. If calico an’t good enough for such a purpose, it isn’t good enough for anything. It’s quite as becoming to the body. He can’t look uglier than he did in that one.” Scrooge listened to this dialogue in horror. As they sat grouped about their spoil, in the scanty light afforded by the old man’s lamp, he viewed them with a detestation and disgust, which could hardly have been greater, had they been demons, marketing the corpse itself. “Ha, ha!” laughed the same woman, when old Joe, producing a flannel bag with money in it, told out their several gains upon the ground. “This is the end of it, you see. He frightened every one away from him when he was alive, to profit us when he was dead! Ha, ha, ha!”
“Spirit,” said Scrooge, shuddering from head to foot. “I see, I see. The case of this unhappy man might be my own. My life tends that way, now.

" He was being looked at by a dead man who was seated with his back against a columnlike tree. The corpse was dressed in a uniform that had once been blue, but was now faded to a melancholy shade of green. The eyes, staring at the youth, had changed to the dull hue to be seen on the side of a dead fish. The mouth was open. Its red had changed to an appalling yellow. Over the gray skin of the face ran little ants. One was trundling some sort of bundle along the upper lip.
The youth gave a shriek as he confronted the thing. He was for moments turned to stone before it. He remained staring into the liquid-looking eyes. The dead man and the living man exchanged a long look. Then the youth cautiously put one hand behind him and brought it against a tree. Leaning upon this he retreated, step by step, with his face still toward the thing. He feared that if he turned his back the body might spring up and stealthily pursue him. The branches, pushing against him, threatened to throw him over upon it. His unguided feet, too, caught aggravatingly in brambles; he received a subtle suggestion to touch the corpse. As he thought of his hand upon it he shuddered profoundly. At last he burst the bonds which had fastened him to the spot and fled, unheeding the underbrush. He was pursued by the sight of black ants swarming greedily upon the gray face and venturing horribly near to the eyes. After a time he paused, and, breathless and panting, listened.

" He carved a turnip and put a light inside. His ghost was known as “Jack of the Lantern,” and then “Jack-o’-lantern.”
The Stingy Jack fable later became part of a night called All Hallows’ Eve. In Europe, people lit fires and dressed up to keep away ghosts.
In Ireland and England, people carved scary faces on vegetables and placed a light inside. All Hallows’ Eve later became known as Halloween.
When jack-o’-lantern carving was brought to the United States, people started using pumpkins. About 1.5 billion pounds (more than 680 million kg) of pumpkins are grown in the United States each year.
Carving pumpkins is fun for people of all ages. Smooth pumpkins work well for jack-o’-lanterns. Some people buy carving kits, while others carve without any help.
First, with help from a parent, cut a hole in the top of the pumpkin to make a lid. Next, scoop out the inside flesh and seeds.
Draw a design on the pumpkin, and then carve it carefully. After the pumpkin is carved, place a candle or other light inside. Finally, put the pumpkin lid back on top.
Many cities have events to show off their carved pumpkins. In Hudson Valley, New York, jack-o’-lanterns make up a big display with spooky sounds and music. Pumpkins are used to make snakes, dinosaurs, and a dome carved with twinkling stars.
A huge display in Los Angeles, California, has pumpkin cars and dinosaurs, and pumpkin carvings of famous people. The artists carve their pumpkins at the event while people watch.
A town in New Hampshire broke a world record for the most lit jack- o’-lanterns. The town had thirty thousand jack-o’-lanterns lit at once!
Carving pumpkins into jack-o’- lanterns is a fun holiday activity. However they are carved, jack-o’- lanterns are a sure sign that Halloween is around the corner.",887.0

The Dells is a gorge—a steep, narrow valley—that was carved by the Wisconsin River. Along its sides are canyons, which are similar to gorges but not as steep or narrow.
We’re almost to the Mississippi River, one of the longest rivers in the world. This part of the Mississippi was carved by glaciers. We cross the Mississippi River on the way to the Great Plains. A plain is a large, flat area without many trees. The Great Plains formed when two plates smashed into each other and joined together. Some parts of the Great Plains are flat, and others have hills.
We drive through a corner of Wyoming and pass some mountains on our left. Some of the mountains have snow, but Mom says even bigger mountains are still to come.

" The giant wave was taking him back toward shore.
As the wave neared shore, it seemed to grow bigger and bigger, swallowing up the little hippo. Then, as all waves nearing shore do, the wave began to crest. A white frothy top spilled over, and the tsunami poured forward onto the shore. Owen, caught up in the huge breaking wave, was tossed about like a cork. As the wave broke, it threw Owen onto the shore with a KAA-THUD!
The little hippo tumbled and rolled, bumping into the debris the rushing water had brought along with him. Owen was pushed farther inland. Finally, the wave ran out of energy, and its water spread thinly over the land. Owen lay bruised and tired, far from the Sabaki River and his mother.
It was not long until a wildlife ranger, who was checking the damage the tsunami had caused, came across the little hippo. He was surprised to see a hippo so near the ocean’s shore. He knew that hippos lived inland along the banks of rivers.
The ranger called for help, and Owen was transported to a wildlife park. Owen began to recover and gain strength, but Owen missed his mother. Owen spotted a large, gray 100-year-old tortoise named Mzee. The tortoise was similar in color to Owen’s mother.
Owen was immediately drawn to Mzee. The old tortoise didn’t seem to mind having Owen cuddle up to him or follow him around.
Owen and Mzee now eat, swim, and sleep together. Everywhere Mzee goes, Owen is at his side. Owen even tries to protect Mzee when someone comes near. It is just what he would do if Mzee really were his mother. Owen was very lucky to survive the tsunami. And he was luckier to find a new mom, even if it was an old tortoise.",766.0
" Then they could be pulled upright using ropes. Workers might have slid the tops of the arches up ramps built of dirt and wood. Then the tops could be set on the standing stones. No one knows exactly how the builders built Stonehenge. They did not leave pictures or writing to explain how they did it. That is why Stonehenge remains a big mystery.
Why was Stonehenge built? Archaeologists continue to look and dig for clues about its purpose. One clue is that it was built away from where most people lived. Experts think Stonehenge was a temple of some kind. People probably came there for special events like crowning a king. They might have visited to remember dead relatives.
Stonehenge was also a graveyard. Archaeologists have found the bodies of about 240 people nearby. Some are skeletons, while others were burned.
Another idea about Stonehenge is that it lines up with the sun’s movements. The sun shines through certain parts of the monument when the seasons change. This was important information for farmers long ago. It helped them figure out the best time to plant their crops.
Today, Stonehenge is a popular site for visitors. More than nine hundred thousand people go there each year. The visitor center has stone tools and other ancient objects. There are huts to show what life was like long ago. Volunteers show visitors ancient skills such as pottery and rope making.
Archaeologists continue to explore the Stonehenge site. They use new tools such as radar that can find objects underground. This helps them make more discoveries faster.
No one knows for sure why ancient people built Stonehenge. How they did it is also a mystery. Still, Stonehenge continues to fill people with wonder thousands of years after it was built.",664.0

Sometimes a fast-moving snowstorm begins in Canada’s western mountains. It then travels east across the American plains, toward the coast. This type of storm is called an Alberta Clipper. Clippers don’t bring a lot of snow. They are known instead for their strong winds and bitter cold. Many of North America’s blizzards start out as nor’easters or Alberta Clippers.
Blizzards don’t just happen in North America, though. Parts of Asia may have powerful blizzards that last for days. Northeast Russia experiences bitter cold and strong winds in winter. In December 2014, it had its worst blizzard in years. Icy cold winds spread more than a foot of snow across the land.
The mix of wind, snow, and cold makes a blizzard very dangerous. The wind chill and low temperature can make flesh freeze. Swirling snow makes it hard to see and can lead to accidents. Blowing snow makes it hard for road crews to clear highways. Wind gusts may also knock down trees and power lines. People can find themselves in the dark, struggling to stay warm.
Unlike years ago, it is now easier to predict when and where blizzards will strike. Today, people have time to prepare. They can make sure they have batteries and flashlights in case of a power loss. Families can stock up on food and water. They can also figure out other ways to keep warm, such as using fireplaces or woodstoves. Once they are prepared, people should settle in and wait out the storm. Those who must go out should make sure they are dressed warmly. Even then, people should not stay out for very long. The best place to be in a blizzard is inside. When the storm ends, people can then safely head outside to enjoy the snow it left behind!",686.0
" In order to master karate, students move through three main steps: kihon, kata, and kumite.
Kihon is the basic set of moves that all karate beginners must learn first. In kihon, students learn to breathe correctly and develop a strong posture. They also learn to do kicks, punches, stances, blocks, and thrusts. The most important thing they will learn is patience. Before moving on to the next step, students practice these moves over and over until they are perfect.
After learning kihon, students can move on to kata. A kata takes the moves from kihon and puts them into a routine. Students must imagine that they are fighting off attackers and use the moves of the kata to defend themselves. A kata is often a combination of punches, kicks, blocks, turns, and stances. In this step, they also practice their flow from one move to the next.
Many students are also asked to practice bunkai while learning kata. With bunkai, students break down the moves from a kata to understand why each move is useful. This teaches them to be focused. Instead of simply doing the moves, students are asked to slow down and think about them.
After perfecting kata through hard work and discipline, students reach kumite. In the final step, they apply everything they have learned. Students pair up and practice moves on an opponent. Kumite is the closest they get to a real fight.
For centuries, students and adults around the world have learned discipline, respect, and self-improvement through karate. They work hard to make progress and earn new belts. People may find that the skills they learn stay with them long after leaving the dojo. Some karate students may become karate masters, but they all have a lot of fun trying to get there.",920.0

Other park rangers keep visitors safe. In the Great Smoky Mountains in Tennessee, rangers sign in every hiker. They make sure everyone comes home safely. If a hiker goes missing, rangers search the mountains. If a hiker is sick or hurt, rangers may need to fly the person out. Saving people can be dangerous. Rangers face flash floods, crumbling cliffs, and wild animals. In fact, park rangers have one of the riskiest jobs in the world!
What Do Rangers Need to Know?
Rangers in different parks know about different things. At Hawai’i Volcanoes National Park, a ranger shows visitors how lava created the mountains, caves, and sea cliffs. A history expert at the Statue of Liberty tells what the statue means to people moving to the United States. Musicians at the New Orleans Jazz Park play music the city is famous for.
Even rangers working in the same park are experts on different subjects. One ranger in Glacier National Park describes how glaciers shaped its beautiful valleys. An animal expert leads scientists to the park’s mountain goats. Another expert talks about the stars in the big, dark Montana sky. A ranger who knows first aid helps a hurt hiker.
Can I Be a Park Ranger?
Does being a park ranger sound like fun? You can start by becoming a park volunteer. Volunteers do many of the same jobs as rangers. They learn about what goes on inside a park. Most rangers go to college. Some study history or science, while others study the wild lands and how people use them.

" Slave owners were furious, and they offered a reward for Harriet’s capture, dead or alive. The reward was $40,000—an enormous amount of money for those days. One day, Harriet overheard a man reading her own wanted poster, which described Harriet as not being able to read. She immediately pulled out a book and pretended to read it, and the man left without giving her a second look.
Harriet helped many of her own relatives out of the South. Thanks to Harriet, six of her ten brothers and sisters escaped. On one difficult journey, she brought her elderly parents north to Canada. Harriet led about three hundred slaves north to freedom. Nothing was more important to her than helping others become free. One famous abolitionist, John Brown, called Harriet Tubman “one of the bravest persons on this continent.” People called Harriet the “Moses of her people,” because like Moses of the Bible, she led her people to freedom.
On April 12, 1861, the Civil War began. The North and South fought each other over the right to own slaves. During the war, Harriet worked as a nurse for the North’s Union Army. She was also a spy, scouting out the Southern army’s weapon warehouses, and she continued to travel into the South to lead slaves north.
When the Civil War ended in 1865, slavery became illegal in the United States. Harriet remarried and lived in Auburn, New York. She sold vegetables door-to-door. Harriet was very poor, yet she turned her own house into a home for needy freed people. She worked for aid and education for freed slaves. Harriet also fought for the right of women to vote.

That’s where we headed next.
We boarded a long-tailed boat and sailed down a klong. People live in homes on the banks of the canal. We saw them washing their clothes, bathing their babies, cooking their meals—even watching television and talking on cell phones. Vendors paddled their floating shops from home to home selling all sorts of things. They sold handwoven fabrics, tropical fruits like uglis that are smelly but sweet, and steaming bowls of noodle soup. The people were so friendly. I was deciding I liked Bangkok best of all when Wanda Lou said, “Time to go home, Cali.” As the plane took off, we sadly said farewell—sayonara to Japan, zai jian to China, and sawatdi to Thailand.
Finally, we were at home in our little house, which is no Imperial Palace, on our narrow street, which is no Great Wall, where there are no boas or cobras and nothing unusual like floating shops.

For a while, life was good for the Crafts. They learned to read and write. Three weeks after arriving in Philadelphia, they went on to Boston, Massachusetts. William got a job as a cabinetmaker, and Ellen worked as a seamstress. Their happiness did not last, however. In 1850, Congress passed the Fugitive Slave Act. The act made it a crime to protect runaway slaves, even in free states. Law officers could receive a large reward for capturing and returning escaped slaves to their owners.
Two bounty hunters arrived in Boston, determined to bring the Crafts back to Georgia as slaves. The terrified Crafts hid with friends, but they could not bear to live in fear. In December 1850, they set out on another journey, this time to England.
The Crafts settled in West London and had five children. They gave lectures against slavery throughout Great Britain. In 1860, William published a book about their escape. The Crafts became teachers, ran a boarding house, and engaged in other business activities to support their family. In 1870, several years after slavery had ended in the United States, William and Ellen returned to their homeland. They settled outside Savannah, Georgia, and purchased land with money raised from antislavery supporters. William and Ellen also used the money to start the Woodville Cooperative Farm School in 1873. The school’s goal was to educate freed slaves so they could enjoy the same opportunities the Crafts had. Although the school was successful at first, it soon ran into money problems and closed in 1876. After fleeing many miles over many years, the Crafts moved to Charleston, South Carolina. There, they lived out the last years of their lives together in freedom, just as they had always dreamed.",922.0

Another Conspiracy?
Some experts suggest that the Gunpowder Plot was an inside job. They think it might have been a plot by the king’s staff to make harsher anti-Catholic laws. It might even have been the king’s top aide who wrote the warning letter to Lord Monteagle. How could the plotters have carried out their work right under the noses of the king’s guards? Were the plotters used as scapegoats to raise support for an unpopular king? There is no clear proof of this. However, the discovery of the Gunpowder Plot brought the public relief that the king’s life had been saved. The king claimed that his survival was a miracle and proof of his right to the throne. Parliament passed a law that same year to make November 5 an official day of celebration. The festivities were intended to strengthen loyalty to the king.
The holiday was first called Gunpowder Treason Day. In the seventeenth century, people rang church bells and lit bonfires to mark the day. In England then, it was popular to burn dummies of hated figures on bonfires. People believed that doing this would drive away evil spirits. On November 5, people began to burn a dummy of Guy Fawkes on the bonfire.
By the late nineteenth century, spectacular firework displays and parades in towns and cities became popular. People marched to where the bonfire and firework displays were held. These days, the bonfires are usually arranged by local organizations.
Guy Fawkes Day celebrates the failure of the Gunpowder Plot to kill the king of England. These events happened over four hundred years ago. Today, millions of people in the United Kingdom continue to enjoy bonfires and special firework displays on November 5. Guy Fawkes Day has become a day to celebrate and have fun with friends and family.",922.0
" Back then, the orchids had been much more common, but these were the first Alejandro had seen since his father died.
He was about to leave when he noticed a sudden movement. A puma stood on a flat rock overlooking the patch of grass, staring at Alejandro with yellow eyes. It paced back and forth.
Alejandro returned the hunter’s gaze, clutching the flower in his hand like a weapon, slowly backing toward the opening. Then, as if giving up, the cat lay down with a low sigh, its eyes lazily half closing. Alejandro almost felt sorry for the beast. It had been hunting the sheep, and he had ruined its meal. He squeezed his way through the tunnel as quickly as he could, not waiting to find out if the puma was willing to attack a human.
With his heart still pounding, Alejandro placed the flower in his pouch and lifted the bleating sheep over the fence. He finally felt safe when he reached the other side.
As he nudged his horse forward, he couldn’t push the blooming pasture and the puma from his mind. They were wild, strong, and healthy. The estancia was no longer a place for wild things, but instead a land that was controlled. The fences protected them, but they also kept the sheep from the rich pastures beyond.
Alejandro imagined an estancia with no fences. Some of the sheep might fall victim to pumas, but the flock as a whole would survive and grow stronger. He realized that he could tell his mother that he had truly learned something today.
Alejandro urged his horse into a gallop. He had to talk to Martín and the other gauchos. It was time to return to the old ways. They could fix this. There was still time.",821.0
" These adventures earned him the name “Leif the Lucky.” Leif never went on another voyage.
Two years later, Leif’s father had died, and Leif was running the family farm. He had no thoughts of sailing. His younger brother, Thorvald, asked to borrow Leif’s ship. He wanted to see for himself this land that Leif had discovered. Thorvald and a crew of thirty explored the Vinland coast for two years. They used Leif’s former winter house as a base.
Their explorations in Vinland brought both discovery and sadness. Their arrival frightened members of the native tribes, who had never seen Europeans. Small fights broke out. Then, men from Thorvald’s crew killed several native fishermen without reason. Striking back a few days later, angry native men attacked a group of Vikings. The surprised Vikings fought hard but were chased away. Thorvald was wounded by an arrow. He died of his wound, and his body was buried in Vinland. He became the first European known to have died and been buried in North America. His crew sailed home to Greenland, but other explorers sailed to Vinland over the next three years. After those journeys, it seemed that exploring this new land was not worth the trouble it caused.
For about 275 years, the Vikings swept across Europe in wave after wave. They were hungry to fight and greedy for riches. They built trade stations along European rivers all the way to the Mediterranean Sea. Viking explorers and raiders even traveled to the Middle East, Africa, and Asia.
The Vikings were skilled people. They could do many things well. They were great warriors, sailors, and explorers. Their conquests left lasting marks on world history. They will always be remembered for their bravery and strength in battle as well as for their many explorations.",801.0
" “Only an Oriental could have planned it. It does not belong to London fogs.” They did not remain very long, to the great relief of Melchisedec, who, as he probably did not comprehend their conversation, felt their movements and whispers ominous. The young secretary seemed interested in everything. He wrote down things about the floor, the fireplace, the broken footstool, the old table, the walls—which last he touched with his hand again and again, seeming much pleased when he found that a number of old nails had been driven in various “You can hang things on them,” he said. Ram Dass smiled mysteriously. “Yesterday, when she was out,” he said, “I entered, bringing with me small, sharp nails which can be pressed into the wall without blows from a hammer. I placed many in the plaster where I may need them. They are ready.” The Indian gentleman’s secretary stood still and looked round him as he thrust his tablets back into his pocket.
“I think I have made notes enough; we can go now,” he said. “The Sahib Carrisford has a warm heart. It is a thousand pities that he has not found the lost child.” “If he should find her his strength would be restored to him,” said Ram Dass. “His God may lead her to him yet.” Then they slipped through the skylight as noiselessly as they had entered it. And, after he was quite sure they had gone, Melchisedec was greatly relieved, and in the course of a few minutes felt it safe to emerge from his hole again and scuffle about in the hope that even such alarming human beings as these might have chanced to carry crumbs in their pockets and drop one or two of them.",981.0
" “There isn’t anything to do,” said Mr. Barrow, folding up his eyeglasses and slipping them into his pocket. “Captain Crewe is dead. The child is left a pauper. Nobody is responsible for her but you.” Miss Minchin became quite white with rage. “I am not responsible for her, and I refuse to be made responsible!” Mr. Barrow turned to go. “I have nothing to do with that, madam,” he said uninterestedly. “Barrow & Skipworth are not responsible. Very sorry the thing has happened, of course.” “If you think she is to be foisted off on me, you are greatly mistaken,” Miss Minchin gasped. “I have been robbed and cheated; I will turn her into the street!”
If she had not been so furious, she would have been too discreet to say quite so much. She saw herself burdened with an extravagantly brought-up child whom she had always resented, and she lost all self-control. Mr. Barrow undisturbedly moved toward the door. “I wouldn’t do that, madam,” he commented; “it wouldn’t look well. Unpleasant story to get about in connection with the establishment. Pupil bundled out penniless and without friends.” He was a clever businessman, and he knew that Miss Minchin was a businesswoman; she would be shrewd enough to see the truth. She could not afford to do a thing which would make people speak of her as cruel and hard-hearted. “Better keep her and make use of her,” he added. “She’s a clever child, I believe. You can get a good deal out of her as she grows older.” “I will get a good deal out of her before she grows older!” exclaimed Miss Minchin. “I am sure you will, ma’am,” said Mr. Barrow, with a little sinister smile. “I am sure you will.

" “Now we round up the stragglers! That’s the best part.” Zach beamed. The pace at the back was perfect for him and Gizmo, and whenever a lazy steer or distracted cow wandered off, he and Mitch and his mom worked together to push it back into the herd. Cowboying was hot, sweaty, dirty work. It was challenging, keeping an eye on all the cattle and coordinating Gizmo’s movements, all while swallowing most of the herd’s dust—but it was more fun than Zach had ever had in his life. That night, nothing could dim Zach’s smile, though he was so sore that it hurt to walk. At the evening campfire, he collapsed beside his mom and crowed, “Best day ever!”
“You were awesome out there,” she said, smiling proudly. “Do you want to see?” She rummaged in her pocket, and out came the last item Zach expected—his phone. There was the cattle drive, captured in vivid detail: Zach and Gizmo trotting off toward the horizon; Zach and Gizmo creeping up on a wayward steer; Zach dismounting, covered in dust. “Oh man, wait until my friends see these!” Zach exclaimed. But the words jerked him out of his digital reverie. The photos would make for great memories, sure, but they were stealing him away from the here and now: his achy legs, the toasting marshmallows, the starlit sky beneath which the ranch hands crooned cowboy songs. Across the fire, Mitch shot him a wink.“Tomorrow, I mean. When we go home.” Zach popped a melty marshmallow into his mouth and turned to his mom. She seemed to understand his words perfectly, despite the goo, judging by her wide smile. “Right now,” he said, “I don’t want to be anywhere but here.”",882.0
"” “Well, be off, then!” said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled down again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches, and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands, and she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height. It was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes, and began talking to herself as usual. “Come, there’s half my plan done now! How puzzling all these changes are!
“I’m never sure what I’m going to be, from one minute to another! However, I’ve got back to my right size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden—how is that to be done, I wonder?” As she said this, she came suddenly upon an open place, with a little house in it about four feet high. “Whoever lives there,” thought Alice, “it’ll never do to come upon them this size: why, I should frighten them out of their wits!” So she began nibbling at the right-hand bit again, and did not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high.",1135.0

" He sent one of his captains off to see if it was true. While that captain was away, Blackbeard dropped off many men on a nearby island. Then, Blackbeard sailed off, taking the loot with him. Some people say that Blackbeard ran his ship onto the sandbar on purpose. Had he tricked his crew so he wouldn’t have to share the treasure with as many people?
It seemed that Edward Teach had taken his loot and stopped sailing. The governor of North Carolina forgave his past crimes. Blackbeard soon returned to his old tricks, though. He offered to share his loot if the governor would allow him to rob ships sailing off the Carolina coast. With this backing, Blackbeard began attacking cargo ships in his remaining ship, the Adventure.
The governor of Virginia, Alexander Spotswood, became tired of Blackbeard’s looting. Spotswood sent Lieutenant Robert Maynard to find and capture Blackbeard. On the morning of November 22, 1718, the crew of Maynard’s ship, Ranger, spotted the Adventure near the island of Ocracoke.
Blackbeard fought for many hours. The Adventure’s cannons fired on Maynard’s ship. In the heavy smoke from the battle, Maynard’s men hid so it seemed as if they had been killed. Thinking he had won, Blackbeard climbed aboard the Ranger. Maynard’s men ran up on deck and hand-to-hand fighting began. Blackbeard fought bravely but Maynard had too many men. Blackbeard was shot five times before he finally fell dead. Maynard’s men threw Blackbeard’s body into the sea.
Blackbeard’s name lived on. Like many pirates, he became an outlaw hero. His life story may be behind characters in books such as Treasure Island and movies such as Pirates of the Caribbean. Next time you hear or read about a pretend pirate, remember one of the real men behind the legend : Blackbeard!",862.0
" Finally, workers were lowered down the mountain on cables to drill shapes out of the rocks.
Workers had many problems. One day they blasted an area of rock for Thomas Jefferson’s nose. The workers found a split in the rock. So the position of Jefferson’s head had to be changed. The crack was patched and now falls across Jefferson’s cheek instead of his nose, where it could break.
Other problems had to be overcome when carving Mount Rushmore. The United States had hard times during a period called the Great Depression. During this time, there was not much money for the memorial. Work had to stop many times and then restart when more money was raised.
During the Depression when many Americans could not find work, the 400 crew members were happy to have jobs. The Mount Rushmore memorial took twelve years to complete. Crews spent a few more years on finishing touches. Sadly, Borglum died before the final touches were finished.
Mount Rushmore has changed over the years. Roads have been built to lead visitors to the memorial. A special theater was also built at the bottom of the mountain. More than two and a half million people visit Mount Rushmore every year. More than two million of them visit during the months of June, July, and August.
Each year the Mount Rushmore Memorial is cleaned and checked for cracks and damage. Rock wears away naturally over time, so the memorial must be fixed often. Repair crews use a special material to fill cracks and repair rock. Workers hang from cables the same way the original crews did in the 1930s.
Today, technology helps to preserve the memorial. Special computers find areas where the memorial needs to be fixed. This care will make sure the memorial is around for future generations to see.",847.0

The first surprise was where things lived: everywhere—in all water levels and temperatures! Marine species lived in the hottest and coldest places in the oceans. Some species lived in deep places without light or oxygen. Another surprise was how many new species were discovered. More than twelve hundred new marine species have been described.
The very cold Deep Ocean Zone has hot volcanoes in it. The water temperature at a volcano can be 400ºC (752ºF), which is hot enough to melt lead. Some species of shrimp, crabs, worms, and bacteria live in this very hot water. These animals use sulfur to live rather than sunlight.
Huge groups of Arctic sea life were also found living in freezing water. Some species of squid, cod, and jellyfish live under solid ice that is 700 meters (2,296 ft) thick. Many of these species slow down their movements to save energy so they don’t freeze.
What Did We Learn?
Scientists learned that life is even more adaptable than they had originally thought. Animals living in the deep ocean have found ways to survive in harsh environments. These environments are places where it would be impossible for most other species to survive. The marine census counted more than 230,000 species. More than 6,000 new species had never been seen before! Some creatures were see-through. Some had warning lights that turned on and off. Others had long feelers instead of eyes. Some had teeth so long that they overlapped their jaws. Some made their own antifreeze to stay warm.
What else lives in the deep ocean? Scientists keep finding new species and new facts. The more they look, the more they find. They think that only one-fourth of all marine life has been counted. Only some of those species have even been described yet. There are many more surprises to come!",810.0
" Farmers shoot tigers that they see attacking their animals.
People around the world are working hard to save tigers from becoming extinct. The fourteen countries where tigers live have many conservation programs to protect tigers. India’s government began a program called Project Tiger in 1973. Project Tiger started creating tiger reserves—large, protected areas of tiger habitat. There are now about forty tiger reserves. Guards work at the reserves to prevent poaching.
Teams of guards also work in Russia and in other places to protect tigers from poaching. Guards work along the borders of many Asian countries. They help stop tiger parts and products from illegally entering or leaving their countries. Governments protect tigers by passing laws to stop illegal tiger business. They also help by punishing poachers. In Russia, poachers used to pay a fine equal to only $50 for killing a tiger. Now they pay $20,000.
Conservation groups from many nations help in countries where tigers live. They ask governments to create more reserves where tigers will be safe. They also raise money for tiger projects, such as helping orphaned tiger cubs. Conservation groups also teach people around the world about the need to protect tigers. And they help scientists and governments think about ways to work together to save tigers.
No one wants tigers to become extinct. But many people do not understand that time is running out for tigers. Several things must happen to save tigers. More land in tiger countries must be protected so it can stay natural and wild. More guards must be paid to stop poachers. Plant medicines must replace tiger medicines so there is less reason for poaching. And anyone who buys or sells tiger parts and products must be stopped. If people work together, these beautiful animals may be saved.",841.0
" These small mammals don’t really fly. They use skin attached to their front and back paws to glide. They mostly eat fungi but may also eat fruits and nuts. Without the old-growth forest, these animals would vanish.
In the northern part of Japan is Shirakami-Sanchi. It’s one of the last old-growth forests in East Asia. Made up mostly of beech trees, the area covers just 65 square miles (170 sq km) of the mountains. Forests like this one once covered most of northern Japan, but people have cut many down.
Shirakami-Sanchi has no trails or buildings, and animals in the area are protected. The forest is home to the Japanese serow. This goatlike animal is only found here and in two other small areas in Japan. More than 2,100 types of insects and 87 types of birds live in the forest. These include the black woodpecker, which is endangered in Japan.
Russia’s Western Caucasus area stretches about 1,062 square miles (2,750 sq km) from the Black Sea to the Caucasus Mountains. The area has many different plants and animals. Coniferous trees make up most of the forests.
Different kinds of endangered animals make these forests their home. Some scientists think that a few endangered snow leopards live here. Scientists sometimes find signs of the large cats, such as paw prints and droppings. The endangered wisent has also been brought back into the forest.
Old-growth forests often have very complex ecosystems. They may have been supporting life for hundreds or thousands of years. Governments, national parks, and other groups protect many of these places. However, other old-growth forests, both small and large, are in danger. Human actions can damage or destroy these delicate environments. Once gone, the beauty and scientific information that these old-growth forests hold may be lost forever.",889.0

" Ibn Battuta reached China in 1346. He was impressed with what he saw in China. He was surprised that even poor monks and beggars in China had clothing made of silk. Silk was a very expensive fabric in most parts of the world.
After less than a year, Ibn Battuta was ready to move on—this time back home to Morocco. On the way home, he saw many cities where people were dying from a terrible disease. In 1349, Ibn Battuta finally arrived back home in Morocco. He had been gone for twenty-four years and was now forty- five years old. Both of his parents had died while he was gone.
Ibn Battuta made two more big trips. He traveled first to Granada, a part of Spain still under Muslim control. Then he went to the Empire of Mali in West Africa. Ibn Battuta spent eight months in Mali as the guest of its ruler. He was impressed by the richness of the country. Ibn Battuta returned to Morocco in 1354—this time for good. He was now fifty years old.
In Morocco, Ibn Battuta hired a young writer to write the story of his travels. The writer put Ibn Battuta’s stories into a book called the Rihlah (Journey). In his final years, Ibn Battuta is thought to have served as a judge. Little is known of his later life, though. He died in Morocco in either 1368 or 1369.
Ibn Battuta journeyed 75,000 miles (120,000 km) during his lifetime. That’s like going all the way around the world three times! He visited and lived in dozens of countries. He was not an explorer.

One of the big hits of the fair was a presentation put on by five kids called a Council of All Beings. They took turns speaking for different living things on Earth, like frogs, wolves, elephants, cactuses, and flowers. The kids talked about how pollution and climate change are hurting each of the living things. They asked people to learn how to help other living things instead of hurting them.
When our class planned the Earth Day fair, we knew that kids from our school and their families would come. We had no idea that our whole town and other towns nearby would hear about it. But during the fair, a news van pulled up with a television reporter and a camera person!
Ms. Gonzales talked with the reporter and then called me over and introduced us. She told him that I had helped to organize the fair. The reporter asked how I had become involved in environmental activities. I told him how seeing the dead sea turtle in Mexico made me want to do something to make a difference. He said he thought our Earth Day fair was a big success.
I was really excited about being on television. But I was even more excited when I got a phone call that night from our town’s mayor. After seeing the news story about the fair, she decided to hold an Earth Day celebration for the whole town next year. She wants to include special activities for kids, and she asked me to work with her! I’m so happy that I found a way to help the environment.

" The bedrock of salt began dissolving. In 1986, a huge sinkhole opened up. It grew to 780 feet (238 m) deep and covered more area than 25 football fields. It is still growing, and new sinkholes are opening up. Hundreds of people have had to leave their homes. To be safe, the entire city may need to move.Some geologists argue that holes caused by human activity shouldn’t be called sinkholes because true sinkholes result from natural processes.
Predicting where natural sinkholes will form is tricky. The erosion that creates them is usually hidden underground. The type of bedrock is the most important factor in whether or not sinkholes form.Areas with soft bedrock that also get heavy rains are at even greater risk. The rainwater adds weight to the overburden. The draining water can also speed up underground erosion.
Tilting trees or signposts can be early clues that the ground is shifting. Growing cracks in walls and sidewalks can also warn that a sinkhole is getting ready to cause trouble. If a sinkhole forms under a house, homeowners can pour tons of dirt and concrete into the hole. This is called grouting. The goal is to plug the hole. Sometimes, though, the dirt and concrete just disappear into the underground space. Another method uses steel rods. These long, strong rods are pushed into solid bedrock deep underground. The rods are then joined to the base of the house. This helps keep the building stable and safe.
Sinkholes can be destructive, but they are rarely dangerous. In some places, they are even beautiful. In parts of Mexico, for instance, sinkholes form lovely pools full of cool, clean water. Sinkholes are also interesting to study. They show water’s powerful effects on soil and rock. Even on solid ground, amazing things are happening beneath our feet.",877.0
" This was far better than flinging buckets of waste out of windows and onto the streets (and sometimes people). However, it polluted the nearby water with harmful bacteria that carried deadly diseases. The water made people sick.
Over the centuries, little by little, humans got better at handling their sewage. Large cities such as New York still had a hard time with their waste, though. New York City was growing fast in the 1800s, and there were no sewage treatment plants. Instead, each home had an outhouse, which was sometimes just a hole in the ground. Since there was no way to flush, human waste would pile up in the hole. When the hole was full, a night-soil man came to remove the backed- up waste. He came at night so people would not have to see him taking buckets to the street and dumping them in his cart. When the night-soil man’s cart was full, he would usually dump it in the nearest river.
Some night-soil men got lazy and just dumped their carts into the streets. Some people allowed their outhouses to spill over and wash into the streets. There were no storm sewers back then for the waste to wash down, so it would pile up where people walked and children played. The smell was awful.
In the mid-1800s, experts began to understand that streets flowing with waste were also flowing with deadly diseases. New York began building sewer systems so the waste would have somewhere to go. By 1914, New York City had nearly 850 miles (1,368 km) of sewers. Today in the United States, waste disappears down toilets and sinks as if by magic. Now you know how it really works, though. So, the next time you flush, take a moment to thank your modern sewerage system!",927.0

“Morty,” Miss Micasso said softly, “you can choose what you would like to do, but you’re a very gifted artist, and you should consider taking ownership of your work.” “Miceangelo was pretty cool,” Morty mused. Then he rummaged through his backpack for his charcoal-colored Magnificent Marker. “I’m not sure if I’ll sign all my art, but signing the mystery art feels like the right thing to do.” Miss Micasso beamed. “I think that’s a good decision,” she said. “And Morty, I’m sure your friends will think of you as the most artistic soccer player they know.”

He enjoyed getting art requests from his eager classmates.
“So, what do you say?” Fred continued. “Draw me as the glorious goalie who blocks Ben’s shot.” “I can punt one past you with my eyes closed!” Ben responded. “Morty only draws realistic scenes.” Morty booted his soccer ball to Ben. “Okay, Fred, prove you can block Ben’s shot, and maybe I’ll draw it,” he teased.

" Weak muscles don’t allow you to do as many activities; for example, you won’t be able to run very far or for very long, and you won’t be able to lift heavy objects. That’s where “bodybuilding” comes in. Bodybuilding is really muscle building. People “build” their bodies by making their muscles bigger and stronger. As they lift weights, their muscles adjust to the activity and become more powerful, so more and more weight can be lifted each time. At first, the muscles will not be able to lift very heavy loads. Over time and with constant training, the muscles build and become strong.
Sometimes people can actually stretch their muscles too far. When this happens, a doctor will say they have “pulled a muscle.” Often when a muscle has been pulled, some muscle fibers have torn. The muscle usually hurts, and it might even feel a little tight. Rest will help the muscle to heal and rebuild its broken fibers. Muscles also weaken if you break a bone. Broken bones are healed by preventing the bones from moving. If the bones don’t move, then the muscles don’t move either. When a cast comes off, the broken bone will be stronger, but the muscles will be weak. Doing slow, moderate exercise will strengthen the weakened muscles.
Your body is a muscle machine. To keep your muscles working, the muscles need to remain active. Doctors stress the importance of exercise for keeping muscles strong, and they’re right. Exercise not only strengthens your skeletal muscles, but it keeps your heart pumping and your blood flowing. Your muscles react to the messages you send to your brain. Tell your muscles to move, and they will. Exercise your muscles daily, and they’ll work more efficiently. So go on—get moving, and mind your muscles!",794.0

Nice monkey!” she crooned, kissing his funny head. “Oh, I do love little animal things.” He was evidently glad to get to the fire, and when she sat down and held him on her knee he looked from her to Becky with mingled interest and appreciation. “He is plain-looking, miss, ain’t he?” said Becky.
“He looks like a very ugly baby,” laughed Sara. “I beg your pardon, monkey; but I’m glad you are not a baby. Your mother couldn’t be proud of you, and no one would dare to say you looked like any of your relations. Oh, I do like you!” She leaned back in her chair and reflected. “Perhaps he’s sorry he’s so ugly,” she said, “and it’s always on his mind. I wonder if he has a mind. Monkey, my love, have you a mind?” But the monkey only put up a tiny paw and scratched his head. “What shall you do with him?” Becky asked. “I shall let him sleep with me tonight, and then take him back to the Indian gentleman tomorrow. I am sorry to take you back, monkey; but you must go. You ought to be fondest of your own family; and I’m not a real relation.” And when she went to bed she made him a nest at her feet, and he curled up and slept there as if he were a baby and much pleased with his quarters.",726.0

“Did escaping slaves ever carve directions in trees or rocks?” Poloma asked. “I’ve never heard of such an occurrence, but every day people uncover new information about the Underground Railroad. Just recently, someone discovered a hidden tunnel and a secret room in a house in Iowa where slaves hid out on their journey north to Canada. Many escaping slaves traveled all the way north to Canada after the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 made it more difficult for them to find freedom in the northern United States.” “What does ‘Follow the Drinking Gourd’ mean?” Poloma asked. “The Drinking Gourd is the constellation of seven stars now called the Big Dipper, which can always be found in the northern sky of the United States. Slaves followed the Drinking Gourd from safe house to safe house, until they finally reached freedom.” The Sun was beginning to set, and tiny slivers of light were flickering through the branches. Poloma took her flashlight from her backpack, turned it on, and took her grandfather’s hand. By the time they were back on the other side of the stream, the Sun had disappeared. Poloma stopped and scanned the sky. “Are you looking for the Drinking Gourd?” her grandfather asked. “There it is!” Poloma was pointing to the bright cluster of stars in the sky. “Shall we follow it?” “It’s your decision. Are we heading north?” Poloma thought about that for a moment. The Drinking Gourd would lead them back across the stream, past the boulder with the cipher, and on to places north. “We need to go south, Papa.” Poloma and Papa turned. They moved slowly, like creeping night creatures. The light from Poloma’s flashlight led them away from the North Star, past the arrows pointing the other way, out of the woods, and home.",962.0

" His education had been that success for that mighty blue machine was certain; that it would make victories as a contrivance turns out buttons. He presently discarded all his speculations in the other direction. He returned to the creed of soldiers. When he perceived again that it was not possible for the army to be defeated, he tried to bethink him of a fine tale which he could take back to his regiment, and with it turn the expected shafts of derision. But, as he mortally feared these shafts, it became impossible for him to invent a tale he felt he could trust. He experimented with many schemes, but threw them aside one by one as flimsy. He was quick to see vulnerable places in them all. Furthermore, he was much afraid that some arrow of scorn might lay him mentally low before he could raise his protecting tale.
He imagined the whole regiment saying: “Where’s Henry Fleming? He run, didn’t ’e? Oh, my!” He recalled various persons who would be quite sure to leave him no peace about it. They would doubtless question him with sneers, and laugh at his stammering hesitation. In the next engagement they would try to keep watch of him to discover when he would run. Wherever he went in camp, he would encounter insolent and lingeringly cruel stares. As he imagined himself passing near a crowd of comrades, he could hear one say, “There he goes!” Then, as if the heads were moved by one muscle, all the faces were turned toward him with wide, derisive grins. He seemed to hear someone make a humorous remark in a low tone. At it the others all crowed and cackled. He was a slang phrase.",923.0

" They discovered a ring around Jupiter, like the ones around Saturn. They also helped scientists learn more about Jupiter’s moons.
The Voyagers arrived at Saturn nine months apart in 1980 and 1981. They took pictures that showed new rings around the solar system’s second- largest planet.
After passing Saturn, Voyager 1 headed toward deep space. Voyager 2 kept going toward Uranus. This strange light blue planet is tipped on its side. Voyager 2 passed Uranus in early 1986.
Next, Voyager 2 flew toward Neptune. It passed the planet in August of 1989 and discovered five new moons. Then, like Voyager 1, Voyager 2 began its journey toward deep space.
The Voyagers aren’t just collecting information. They are also carrying a message. It’s a greeting to other living things that may be in space. The message is on a “Golden Record” on the side of each spacecraft. The record has music, art, and people from around the world saying “hello” on it.
The outside of the record has a map that shows where Earth is. Other living things could use the map to find our planet, but that probably won’t happen soon. Voyager 1 won’t come close to another star for at least forty thousand years!
Now that the Voyagers have finished exploring planets, they have a new task. Their job is to explore space beyond our solar system. In August 2012, Voyager 1 left our solar system and began this new journey. The spacecraft is the first thing made by people ever to leave our solar system.
Voyager “has opened up our solar system,” says project scientist Dr. Edward Stone. The two spacecraft flew past all of the solar system’s giant outer planets and many moons. Now the Voyagers are giving us a first look at deep space while carrying a message from Earth.",773.0
" Others carve without any help from patterns.
The first step in carving a pumpkin is to cut a hole in the top to make the lid. Always have a parent help out while carving with a knife. Next, the inside flesh and the seeds can be scooped out until the pumpkin is empty. Many people roast the seeds for a snack. Others make tasty pies, bread, or soup with the pumpkin flesh.
The next step is to draw a design on the pumpkin. Then, it’s time to carve. People can carve faces, animals, or a message. They can trace out designs or even paint to decorate the pumpkin. After the pumpkin is carved, a candle or other light can be placed inside. Finally, the pumpkin lid goes back on top.
Events Many cities put on special events to show off their carved pumpkins. In Hudson Valley, New York, thousands of jack-o’-lanterns make up a big display. This festive event is complete with spooky sounds and music. Pumpkins lie side by side to form big snakes and dinosaurs. Visitors can walk through a dome of pumpkins all carved with twinkling stars.
A huge display in Los Angeles, California, presents pumpkin cars and dinosaurs, and pumpkin carvings of famous people. People can watch the artists carve their pumpkins at this event.
Recently, a town in New Hampshire broke a world record for the most lit jack-o’-lanterns on display. The town had thirty thousand jack-o’-lanterns lit at once!
Carving pumpkins into jack-o’-lanterns is a fun activity for people of all ages. Pumpkins can be carved with a spooky face or detailed art. They can even be used as part of a big display.

" It mixes with the clear waters of the Mississippi and passes along its nickname: “The Big Muddy.” The Mississippi grows wide here, too.
For the next 190 miles (306 km), the river runs through areas with many wild animals. Bald eagles nest in the tall trees and eat the fish that swim in the river.
Next, the Ohio River comes in from the east and joins the Mississippi. The amount of water doubles, and the river grows wider still. In many spots, it stretches 1.5 miles (2.4 km) from bank to bank. By the time the river reaches Louisiana, the Mississippi is deep enough in some places to cover the Statue of Liberty.
The Lower Mississippi has no dams. It does have a system to contain floods, but some floods are just too big. In fact, the Mississippi is famous for its floods, which sometimes destroy buildings and even kill people.
Yet the floods are not all bad. Along the river’s banks, the rich soil that the floods leave behind makes good farmland for cotton and grains. Along the lower part of the river, more cities rise up. From Memphis, Tennessee, and New Orleans, Louisiana, boats carry iron and steel, rubber, paper, and wood. They carry farm crops such as cotton from the area, too. Some items move north, back up the river, and some move farther south.
Several types of turtles call this part of the river home. So does the American alligator.
Once it passes New Orleans, the Mississippi flows into the Gulf of Mexico. The rain that fell in Lake Itasca three months ago has reached the ocean. To do that, it has traveled the length of the United States. Someday, some of that water may return as rain to Lake Itasca. It may make the journey all over again. And again...",837.0

" The Church believed the Sun, Moon, planets, and stars all moved around Earth. But Galileo’s discovery of the changing shape of Venus didn’t fit this picture. Taken together, Galileo’s discoveries were big clues that the solar system moved around the Sun, not Earth. He was not the first person to come up with this idea. However, his discoveries were the best proof yet that Earth was not the center of our solar system.
The Church did not like this idea. At that time, the Church could put people on trial for ideas that went against Church teachings. In 1633, the Church put Galileo on trial and found him guilty. Galileo was forced to say that his discoveries had been lies, even though he knew they were not. The Church ordered Galileo to stay in his home for the rest of his life. He was also told not to publish any more books.
Galileo continued to write down his ideas anyway. He published his final book, Two New Sciences, in 1638. At this point, Galileo had become blind, and his health was poor. He died in 1642 of natural causes.
We now know that Galileo was right: Earth does move around the Sun. Galileo’s gift for asking important questions helped him make some of the greatest discoveries of his time. Galileo was the first scientist to say that the laws of nature could be written down using math. He was also one of the first scientists to always use measurements in his experiments. In this way, he made it easier for other scientists to test his ideas. Galileo was a model for many scientists who followed him, including Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein.

" They may make noise when playing or scared, or to greet other manatees. Noises also help a mother and baby stay in contact with each other.
Like other mammals, manatee mothers give birth to live young. A baby manatee is born between 12 and 13 months after it begins to grow. It is about 1 meter (3 ft) long at birth. It is born underwater and must be brought to the surface right after birth to breathe air. The mother dunks her baby underwater several times to teach it how to go underwater and come back to the surface. A baby manatee begins to eat plants a few weeks after it is born. It may also keep drinking its mother’s milk for up to two years.
All manatees are in great danger of becoming extinct, or dying out completely. Their numbers are low because of many reasons. One reason is that they have been hunted for food and for their hides. Manatees also can die when they get trapped in fishing nets. In Australia, they sometimes die when they get caught in nets placed along beaches to protect swimmers from sharks.
One of the biggest dangers to manatees comes from power boats. Many boaters ignore signs about staying away from areas where manatees live. Manatees move slowly and cannot escape a speeding boat. Boat propellers can injure or kill a manatee. Another threat to manatees comes from pollution of the water they live in. Pesticides and other chemicals dumped in water can be poisonous to manatees.
Laws have been passed to protect manatees. Areas have been created to protect them. Many groups are working to save the manatee. They are trying to educate people about these gentle creatures and the threats to their survival.",738.0

The Minotaur was another creature that had both human and animal parts. It had the head of a bull and the body of a man. The monster was so scary that it was kept in a maze under the palace of the king of Crete. Seven boys and seven girls were sent to the Minotaur. A brave boy named Theseus said he wanted to be one of them. The princess of Crete saw Theseus and fell in love with him.
The princess wanted to save Theseus from the Minotaur. She gave him a ball of yarn to tie to a door. He was to unwind it as he made his way through the maze. She also gave Theseus a weapon. After Theseus defeated the Minotaur, he followed the trail of yarn out of the maze. Because bulls were important to a goddess in Crete, they may have stood for Crete itself. Some people think that Theseus winning his fight against the Minotaur showed that the Greeks took over Crete.
The Minotaur was tiny compared to the giant Typhon (TY-fon). It was a monster with wings, snakes for legs, and one hundred heads—one human and the rest other creatures. Typhon stood for the strong forces of nature.
Only Zeus, the king of the gods, could match Typhon. Their battle shook the whole world. Zeus defeated Typhon and then locked him up under Earth. The Greeks blamed Typhon for strong winds. The idea that Zeus was stronger than these forces of nature made them feel better.
The Greeks did not put creatures in their myths just to entertain or scare people. These creatures and the myths about them helped people understand the world around them at the time. Mythical creatures were important in ancient Greece. The amazing stories about them are still popular today.",667.0

Computer firing panels have become so precise that fireworks can be set to music. A designer chooses a favorite piece of music. The designer listens to the music over and over, imagining where to put a purple fountain, a golden blast, or flashes and crashes. The firing panel is programmed to light the shells with the music, using the timer on the CD or computer file.
Fireworks explode, and explosions can be deadly. Fireworks injure about 10,000 people every year in the United States alone. Firecrackers can blow off a hand. Sparklers can send a glowing-hot spark of metal into someone’s eye. And illegally stored fireworks can cause devastating fires. In addition, fireworks cause smoke and noise, and they often terrify animals. Many states have laws against using fireworks. Those laws exist to protect people. Using, storing, or selling illegal fireworks can lead to arrest, fines, or even jail. It is best to leave fireworks to the trained professionals.
If you do watch fireworks, be sure to follow these safety tips: • Always watch from a safe distance, and never approach the fireworks. • Never pick up debris from fireworks. It may still contain explosive gunpowder. • Bring ear protection. Long exposure to loud noises can damage your hearing. • Never, ever light fireworks yourself. If consumer fireworks are legal in your state, always have an adult light them. • Have water handy to put out any fires or sparks.",854.0

In those days there was no television, so people were eager to get a peek at their newly elected president. A large crowd had gathered to see and hear him. In that crowd stood Grace Bedell and her father. Knowing he was in Grace’s hometown, Lincoln decided to talk about his beard. When he finished, he said that if the young lady who wrote the letter was in the crowd, he would like to meet her.
Mr. Bedell, with Grace in hand, struggled through the tight crowd to where Lincoln Lincoln climbed down and spoke with Grace. She remembered him saying, “Gracie, look at my whiskers. I have been growing them for you.” He gave her a kiss on the cheek. Then, to the sound of cheers, he got back on the train.

Starting in the town of Nanyuki, you cross the equator and enter Sirimon Park. All day, you hike through a forest of bamboo, a treelike grass that grows quickly in hot, wet weather. On day two, you enter a treeless area of low grasses. On day three, the land changes again—now it’s rocky with little plant life. It’s hard to catch your breath and you’re freezing, even though you’re wearing heavy clothes. You think to yourself, “How can this be?

" When there was less than two feet of line left, I wrapped it around my right hand and hauled back hard. There was a return tug that nearly pulled me off the step, and then inch by inch I started reeling in that whale of a catfish. Old Moby was strong, and the skin on my hands was shredded like birthday ribbon where he pulled the line through my palms.
By the time I got that beast out of the water, it was dark and I could barely see it, but my arms and back could feel the mighty weight. It was the fishing pole for sure. It being dark and all, I had less than thirty minutes to get to DeWilde’s.
With the prize heavy on my back, I ran. I slipped three times, fell twice, and finally ripped up the steps of the Feed and Seed. Inside was packed with town folk. I must have been a sight to see—hands bleeding, jeans torn from falling—but I was there. From the looks of things, my catfish, Old Moby, was the biggest fish caught.
Later, there was no question that I had truly caught the biggest fish. Later, there was no question that I truly was ten minutes late.
There was no question that my granddaddy won first prize with his puny little catfish that was half the size of Old Moby. All in all, it still didn’t end too badly. While the womenfolk cooked the catfish, men—grown men—gathered around me and bragged on my skill.
Kind of made me feel all grown up. My granddaddy never found out that my secret plan was to give the pole to him anyway. Things kind of always work out that way in Simplicity, my hometown.",785.0

Even after our chicks are born, we keep cooling them off until they grow their own feathers.
I am called a spoonbill because I have a long beak that flattens out at the end like a spoon. People often confuse me with a flamingo because of my white and pink color, but not after they see my bill, which looks nothing like a flamingo’s. To find food, I sweep my bill back and forth in the mud and shallow water, using touch more than sight to hunt. When I feel something bump against my beak, I snatch it up. I like to eat frogs, shellfish, seaweed, and small fish, which I will regurgitate into my babies’ mouths back at the nest.
I am a toucan, and I have a huge and colorful beak that is actually very light because it’s full of air pockets. I eat fruit, seeds, insects, eggs, and sometimes lizards. My beak helps me reach fruit while I sit in rainforest trees, and to toss it back and forth with another toucan as part of a mating ritual. I can also use my beak to skin the fruit. I have two claws that point forward and two that point backward to help me hold onto branches, and my nest is in a tree hole.

Washington’s style of leadership was a good match for this task. He led the nation firmly and with great dignity—just as he had led the Continental Army. Washington was elected president again in 1792. He faced a major problem in his second term with the Whiskey Rebellion. People who made whiskey were angry that the government was taxing them. Washington had to send in the military to calm them. Washington was also facing another war between Britain and France. He declared that the United States would not get involved. A treaty, or official agreement, was signed but remained unpopular. Many people thought the treaty supported the British too much, and President Washington himself was blamed.
Feeling tired after serving his country for so many years, Washington chose not to serve a third term as president. Before leaving office, he wrote a Farewell Address, in which he offered some advice. He warned against joining forces with other nations because it could lead to more war. He also warned against building too big of an army. In 1797, Washington began his retirement at Mount Vernon, spending time with Martha and overseeing his beloved farm. Two years later, during a cold and snowy Virginia winter, Washington fell ill. He died on December 14, 1799.
George Washington’s place in history is firm. His courage and character are as admired today as they were when he was alive. His leadership style, both in the military and in the presidency, are great models for modern military officers and presidents to follow. The nation admired him then, and the world admires him today. A congressman at the time said Washington was “first in war, first in peace, first in the hearts of his countrymen.” George Washington truly was the Father of His Country.",912.0
" It was rough, wooded, and rocky, but Laura instantly knew it was home. With hard work, Rocky Ridge grew into a beautiful, successful farm. After so much wandering, Laura was content. In time, Laura’s daughter, Rose, moved away to San Francisco. There she became a well- known journalist. She was making a living at something Laura herself had always loved— writing. Now that life on Rocky Ridge Farm was comfortable, could Laura do the same?
Laura began to pour her memories onto the page. Sometimes she would stay up all night writing at a little desk that Manly built for her. Soon, she had written an entire book about her early years under the towering trees of Wisconsin. She called it Little House in the Big Woods. Rose sent it to a publisher. Sixty-four-year-old Laura didn’t think much would come of it. After all, it was the 1930s. People had cars, electricity, radio—who wanted to hear about doing backbreaking chores in a dark forest? The book was an immediate hit. The mailbox at Rocky Ridge overflowed with letters from young readers begging for more. Laura wrote about her time on the Kansas prairie in Little House on the Prairie and near Walnut Grove in On the Banks of Plum Creek. The frightful winter in De Smet became The Long Winter, and what followed became Little Town on the Prairie.
Laura loved answering letters from her fans and traveling to readings and book signings. Yet she was always happy to return home to Manly and Rocky Ridge Farm. The couple both lived into their nineties. After her death in 1957, Laura Ingalls Wilder’s books lived on. They even became a TV series in 1974. Her stories of pioneer life still delight young readers today. Her life has become part of American history.",909.0
" “Don’t let the other kingdom know that you come from our side,” Richard said. “Yeah, I don’t want those people knowing who we are,” Mary said.
“They’ll only come over and kill us,” said Richard. Frederic just sighed. But the bird was even wiser than the children supposed. It understood that the people feared and hated what was on the other side of the wall, even though they weren’t sure what it was. Off it flew over the wall, and after three very long days, it returned. “Tell us what you saw,” Frederic asked, anxiously. “I saw people,” said the parrot, “and they all looked very sad. I flew down into a tree and listened to them. They said they regretted ever having the argument, and they wished they had never built this wall. They only hoped that they could be friends with your kingdom again.” The children were astonished and a little ashamed. They had never suspected that the people on the other side of the wall might want to be friends.
“Send a message to the other kingdom,” Mary said, quickly. “Tell them that we want to be friends, and that we’re also really sorry about the argument, whatever it was.”
The parrot seemed to wink to itself. You see, it had already told the other kingdom that the children were sending a message asking for peace. The people there were just like the people in this kingdom—they did not know what lay beyond the wall, but they hated it anyway. The other kingdom had been as shocked and ashamed of their hatred as the children had been. In no time, the wall was gone, and the two kingdoms were friends again. They forgot all about their argument, whatever it was.",747.0

The boys’ father, who had wandered ahead, came back to tell them of a scene down the path. “Hunting and fishing were not the only sources of food. Come read about this!” Gathering was even safer than fishing, the boys read. While early humans didn’t farm, they gathered and ate wild roots, berries, and mushrooms. They also found eggs and honey, and even ate larvae and mature insects. “Yuck!” exclaimed the boys at the same time. They were so grossed out, they didn’t even say jinx.
Next, the boys saw a scene of an early human drawing on a cliff. “Maybe this will tell us more about the cave paintings,” said Emmanuel. The boys learned that early Homo sapiens liked to draw, often on animal bones and cave walls. These ancient people didn’t just draw anything they saw in their world; they drew things that meant something to their hearts—maybe as an act of worship. The scene’s sign read: Prehistoric painters used their fingers or brushes (made from hair or plants) to apply paint. They used yellow, red, and black paint made from minerals in rocks. For 20,000 years, they painted the same way, using the same three paints. They used the rock’s shape to enhance their paintings and used tools to carve the surface.
Victor, Emmanuel, and their parents took a canoe trip on the Dordogne (door-DOAN) River, passing castles and caves that dotted the golden cliffs. When the boys stopped paddling, their dad asked, “Are you getting tired?” Victor answered, “I was imagining the paintings that might fill those caves up there.” “Wouldn’t it be great to be the one who discovers them?” Emmanuel added. He was already dreaming of becoming an archaeologist and discovering more about the people who painted caves long ago.",773.0
" The Russians suffered about forty-five thousand losses and the French thirty thousand.
Napoleon chased the Russian army farther into Russia, but his army was getting smaller and weaker. Many soldiers were dying of hunger and disease. Napoleon reached Moscow in mid-September, only to find it nearly empty. Much of the city was soon burning from fires set by the Russians. In mid-October, with winter approaching, Napoleon took his army back to France. Russian forces attacked the French army many times as it withdrew. Only about ten thousand of Napoleon’s soldiers made it back to France.
Napoleon’s time as the ruler of Europe soon came to an end. An alliance of his enemies surrounded Paris in 1814 and forced him to give up his throne. Napoleon was exiled to the Italian island of Elba. However, he escaped in early 1815 and raised a new army. Napoleon met his final defeat at the Battle of Waterloo in Belgium on June 18. The Napoleonic Wars were finally over. France’s monarchy was brought back. This time, Napoleon was exiled to a faraway place: the British island of St. Helena in the South Atlantic Ocean. He lived the rest of his life there and died in 1821. His body was later returned to France.
Napoleon helped shape the later history of Europe. The ideas of the Napoleonic Code were adopted by many other nations, which based their legal systems on them. The code led to the modern age of European politics. Napoleon’s influence also included his great success at war. His battle tactics and campaign strategies have since been studied at many military schools. Someone once asked England’s Duke of Wellington, the victor at Waterloo, who he thought was history’s greatest general. His answer was Napoleon.",908.0

In 1789, George Washington was elected the first U.S. president. Jefferson became the country’s first secretary of state. In 1797, his friend John Adams became the second president, and Jefferson became the vice president. However, the two argued about the nature of government. Adams believed that a strong central government was important. Jefferson believed that the individual states should have the strongest powers. With a strong central government, the president and Congress have the most power. A strong central government felt too much like having a king and parliament, Jefferson argued. Wasn’t that what the colonists had fought against? Jefferson and Adams wound up not speaking to each other for more than ten years.
In 1801, Jefferson became America’s third president. He served two terms for a total of eight years. During that time, he cut the country’s debt in half. He also doubled the country’s size by making the Louisiana Purchase from France in 1803. The Louisiana Purchase extended the western border of the United States all the way to the Rocky Mountains. The Louisiana Purchase turned the young United States into a large country. It helped the nation become an important world power. It was also the first time in history that so much land had been exchanged by two countries without war.
After his second term as president, Jefferson returned to Virginia. He spent his days reading, writing, and tending to his fruit and vegetable gardens. He also helped start Virginia’s first public university. Thomas Jefferson died on July 4, 1826. John Adams died the same day. It was the United States’ fiftieth birthday. Today, Jefferson is remembered for his thoughts on freedom, rights, and democracy. His words and actions helped create and define a free United States.",818.0
" The ancient Chinese discovered they could separate the fibers from the cocoon. Then, they spun the fibers together to make a strong thread. The thread was woven together to make beautiful cloth.
One of the most widely celebrated holidays in China is the New Year. The Chinese New Year takes place in late January or early February, depending on the Chinese calendar. During the festival, dancers carry colorful dragons or lions through the streets. People light firecrackers and enjoy feasts. They decorate their doorways with poetry written on strips of red paper. These traditions are thought to bring good luck in the coming year. The Lantern Festival is another popular celebration in China. Held soon after the Chinese New Year, it celebrates the first full moon of the year. People hang colorful paper lanterns outside with riddles attached. Others try to solve the riddles to receive a small gift. People also enjoy sweet dumplings made of rice flour.
Rice is the basis for many meals in China. Other common ingredients are noodles, potatoes, meat, fish, and tofu. The typical meals can be different depending on the region. In some parts of China, the food may be very spicy. In the southeast near the ocean, seafood is a main part of many dishes. In the north, many people use wheat instead of rice. For dessert, many Chinese people have seasonal fruit. They may also enjoy candies, pancakes, or a dish made of shaved ice and fruit called baobing (BOU-beeng).

It’s not hard to spot a Secret Service agent. Just look for the man or woman wearing sunglasses. The glasses allow the agent to see what people in a crowd are doing, even in bright sunlight. Agents also wear a tiny speaker in their ear. That’s because the Secret Service has its own communication system. The speaker allows agents to hear directions from a special command unit. Agents often look as if they are whispering words into the sleeve of their clothing. Inside the sleeve is a tiny microphone that allows agents to talk to one another.
President Ronald Reagan was leaving a Washington, D.C., hotel after giving a speech. Pop! Pop! Pop! Someone was firing a pistol. Agent Timothy McCarthy quickly responded. He used his body to shield Reagan from the shooter. McCarthy was struck by a bullet. He later recovered from his wounds. Another agent, Dennis McCarthy, grabbed the attacker and stopped the shooting. Although he was wounded, Reagan survived the attack. “I forgot to duck,” he famously said. Still, President Reagan’s close call shows the dangers that Secret Service agents face.
Why do Secret Service agents keep doing their job if it is so dangerous? It’s more than a job. By protecting the president, agents are serving their country. The death of a president can change the course of history. That’s why thirty-five Secret Service agents, officers, and other agency workers have given their lives in the line of duty. Secret Service agents are trained to “take a bullet” for the president. As long as there are people willing to harm America’s elected leader, there will be Secret Service agents sworn to stop them.",800.0
" Pirates with wooden legs are often popularized in movies and books, such as Treasure Island, probably because of Pegleg.
Do You Know?
Captain Kidd was another famous English pirate. When he was finally captured and put to death, the authorities ordered his body to be hung by the harbor for all to see. This was done to discourage others from becoming pirates.
Another privateer was Sir Francis Drake, an Englishman. He started sailing when he was just 14. He first sailed with his cousin John Hawkins, who took slaves from Africa to the Americas. Sir Francis began to captain his own ship in 1570. He attacked Spanish ships, stealing large amounts of treasure for Queen Elizabeth of England.
Sir Francis did not limit his pirating activity to the sea. When he learned that the Spanish were taking more riches from mines in Panama by mule train, he went inland and attacked the mule trains. He even captured the town in the center of the mining region. Sir Francis Drake became a rich and successful pirate by attacking ships and mule trains. Queen Elizabeth rewarded Drake for capturing so much treasure for England by making him a knight.
During the Golden Age of piracy, no ship was safe on the sea. The Caribbean Sea was one of the most notorious hangouts for pirates. But pirates sailed the seas in other parts of the world as well.
Pirates were often lawless, vicious men and women who made their living by stealing and robbing. Other pirates were ex-sailors hired by kings and queens who were greedy and wanted more wealth.
Modern-day pirates still roam the seas of the world. But rather than sailing slow wooden sailboats, they have high-powered speedboats. They attack small pleasure boats and ships. They steal valuables that they can then sell on the black market.",950.0
" Vic Wertz blasts one to deep center field. The Giants’ Willie Mays turns at the crack of the bat. He sprints straight to the outfield wall, some 450 feet (137 m) from home plate. Like a football wide receiver, he extends his hands at just the right moment and makes an over-the-shoulder catch.
“Unbelievable! Miraculous!” cry the broadcasters. Then Mays has the presence of mind to whirl and uncork an amazing throw back to the infield. The startled runners return to their bases. This long out killed the Indians’ momentum and set the tone for the series, which the Giants won four games in a row.
Reggie Jackson, “Mr. October”
The Yankees are ahead, three games to two, and lead 7-3 in the eighth. Up steps Reggie Jackson. What a game he’s had! He hit home runs in the fourth and fifth innings, both times on the first pitch and from different pitchers.
Here’s the first pitch from a third pitcher, Charlie Hough... Smack! It’s going, going... Kiss it goodbye! Reggie Jackson is the first player to hit three home runs in a single World Series game since Babe Ruth in 1928. More remarkably, he did it on the first pitch each time. Jackson set another World Series record in 1978, hitting a total of five home runs and earning the nickname “Mr. October.”
The grand stage of the World Series has also hosted two of the rarest feats in baseball. In 1920, it was a one-man triple play. In one play, second baseman Bill Wambsganss made all three defensive outs by himself! In 1956, Don Larsen pitched a perfect game. Not one opposing batter got on base.

" One man had a final objection: “How could yeh hear ’em talkin’?” But the men, for a large part, nodded, admitting that previously the two friends had spoken truth. They settled back into reposeful attitudes with airs of having accepted the matter. And they mused upon it, with a hundred varieties of expression. It was an engrossing thing to think about. Many tightened their belts carefully and hitched at their trousers. A moment later the officers began to bustle among the men, pushing them into a more compact mass and into a better alignment. They chased those that straggled and fumed at a few men who seemed to show by their attitudes that they had decided to remain at that spot. They were like critical shepherds, struggling with sheep. Presently, the regiment seemed to draw itself up and heave a deep breath. None of the men’s faces were mirrors of large thoughts.
The soldiers were bended and stooped like sprinters before a signal. Many pairs of glinting eyes peered from the grimy faces toward the curtains of the deeper woods. They seemed to be engaged in deep calculations of time and distance. They were surrounded by the noises of the monstrous altercation between the two armies. The world was fully interested in other matters. Apparently, the regiment had its small affair to itself. The youth, turning, shot a quick, inquiring glance at his friend. The latter returned to him the same manner of look. They were the only ones who possessed an inner knowledge. “Mule drivers—hell t’ pay—don’t believe many will get back.” It was an ironical secret. Still, they saw no hesitation in each other’s faces, and they nodded a mute and unprotesting assent when a shaggy man near them said in a meek voice: “We’ll git swallowed.”",957.0
" The skirmish fire increased to a long clattering sound. With it was mingled far-away cheering. A battery spoke. Directly the youth could see the skirmishers running. They were pursued by the sound of musketry fire. After a time the hot, dangerous flashes of the rifles were visible. Smoke clouds went slowly and insolently across the fields like observant phantoms. The din became crescendo, like the roar of an oncoming train. A brigade ahead of them and on the right went into action with a rending roar. It was as if it had exploded. And thereafter it lay stretched in the distance behind a long gray wall, that one was obliged to look twice at to make sure that it was smoke.
The youth, forgetting his neat plan of getting killed, gazed spell bound. His eyes grew wide and busy with the action of the scene. His mouth was a little ways open. Of a sudden he felt a heavy and sad hand laid upon his shoulder. Awakening from his trance of observation he turned and beheld the loud soldier. “It’s my first and last battle, old boy,” said the latter, with intense gloom. He was quite pale and his girlish lip was trembling. “Eh?” murmured the youth in great astonishment. “It’s my first and last battle, old boy,” continued the loud soldier. “Something tells me—” “What?” “I’m a gone coon this first time and—and I w-want you to take these here things—to—my—folks.” He ended in a quavering sob of pity for himself. He handed the youth a little packet done up in a yellow envelope. “Why, what the devil—” began the youth again.

" Seppala’s lead dog was a twelve-year-old Siberian husky named Togo.
To save time, Togo and his teammates raced over an area of frozen sea in the darkness. The next day, they struggled up snow-packed mountains. They traveled an amazing 91 miles (146 km)—more than any other team.
The sled dog teams continued their difficult journey. Gunnar Kaasen and his lead Siberian husky, Balto, left on the second to last leg. They raced through a terrible blizzard.
Balto led the team through whiteout conditions. At one point, a powerful gust of wind flipped the sled over. The medicine fell in the snow. With frostbitten hands, Kaasen found the medicine.
When Kaasen arrived at the hand-off point, the next team was not ready to leave. Kaasen decided to continue on to Nome himself. Just before dawn on February 2, Balto and his teammates arrived in Nome. The journey took only five and a half days. The medicine saved the sick children and stopped the spread of the disease.
A year after the race, Seppala took his dogs, including Togo, on a tour across the United States. They drew large crowds. He was one of the first to bring the Siberian husky breed to other parts of the country.
That same year, a statue of Balto was built in New York City. Balto and some of his teammates were in a dog show that toured the United States. However, they were not treated well and were kept in small cages. People gave money to bring the dogs to Cleveland, Ohio, where they were welcomed in a parade. They stayed in the Cleveland Zoo for the rest of their lives. To this day, Balto remains famous for his bravery.

The canyon’s layers give us a peek into the past and help scientists understand how Earth has changed over time. Scientists say the rocks at the bottom of the canyon are nearly two billion years old.
People have been coming to the Grand Canyon for at least twelve thousand years. Groups of Native Americans camped, hunted, made tools, and grew food in the area. The region was home to many tribes. They built homes and other structures into the sides of the canyon.
By the 1850s, the Grand Canyon was still mostly unexplored by Americans. They sometimes called the area “the great unknown.” In 1869, John Wesley Powell led a dangerous trip through the canyon. The group traveled on the Colorado River. It was the first recorded trip of its kind.
Over time, more people came to the Grand Canyon to explore, photograph its landscape, and ride the river. The canyon became even more popular after it was made a national park.
Today millions of visitors go to Grand Canyon National Park. Some hikers explore the far reaches of the canyon for weeks. There are even cabins at the bottom where visitors can stay.
Rafting on the Colorado River is also popular. The Grand Canyon includes about 277 miles (446 km) of twisting river. The water can be rough, fast, and rocky in some places, making for a grand adventure. People also love to walk on trails along the rim of the canyon. They marvel at miles of colorful walls and watch as sunlight and shadows move across the landscape.

" People drove wolves out of Yellowstone more than one hundred years ago. Later, workers for the national parks brought them back. Today, about one hundred wolves live in Yellowstone.
The park is also home to more than 350 other kinds of animals. Elk, deer, golden eagles, beavers, and foxes roam freely in the park. Yellowstone is a safe haven for these wild animals. Visitors can enjoy watching them but should never get too close.
Yellowstone is one of the most popular national parks in the United States. Before it became a national park, Native Americans had been visiting the area for thousands of years. Many of them built shelters for a time, hunted for food, and made tools.
Explorers also traveled through Yellowstone. They took note of its wonders through reports, photographs, and paintings. The United States decided that the land, water, and wildlife of Yellowstone were special. New laws were made to protect Yellowstone so people could not own or sell the land. Instead, Yellowstone was set aside for the enjoyment of all people and to take care of its animals. The idea of the national park was born.
Yellowstone paved the way for more national parks. There are now more than fifty national parks in the United States and many more around the world. Some, such as Grand Canyon National Park, protect natural wonders. Others, such as battlefields, protect places that are important to history.
Today, about three million people from around the world travel through Yellowstone every year. They come to fish, hike, camp, watch wildlife, and visit the hot springs. In Yellowstone, people can see wonders rarely found anywhere else. The first explorers to set foot in Yellowstone knew they had found something special.

" Planting sweet potatoes, peas, or peanuts in the fields after the cotton was picked also helped the soil. These crops put important nutrients back in the soil after they were used up by cotton plants. Carver sent out information about how to grow and cook these crops. By eating them, farmers spent less money buying food from stores.
Farmers also needed a way to sell the new crops, so Professor Carver became an inventor. He invented more than a hundred ways to use sweet potatoes and three hundred ways to use peanuts!
By 1921, people were listening to Carver’s ideas. He was asked to speak before the U.S. Congress—the country’s lawmakers. Some members of Congress laughed and made fun of him. He had been given ten minutes to talk, though, and he made the most of them.
Carver talked about all the things that could be made with the tiny peanut. The men fell silent. When Carver’s ten minutes were up, they gave him more time. In the end, they passed a law to help U.S. peanut farmers. Over the years, Carver became as famous as many rock stars are today. Crowds gathered to hear him speak. He turned down jobs and money because he thought helping people was more important. He believed that ideas were free and should be freely given.
George Washington Carver believed that people should treat each other with respect. He won the respect of a nation at a time when few black people got much respect at all. Carver also believed that people should respect and care for the Earth. If they did, nature would provide the things they needed. Many years later, we are discovering that he was right.",820.0
" She became famous when she danced the lead role in Balanchine’s ballet Firebird. Tallchief became the first American prima ballerina.
Balanchine created some of his most beautiful ballets for Tallchief. She was the Sugar Plum Fairy in The Nutcracker and the White Swan in Swan Lake. While Tallchief was with the New York City Ballet, she danced with them in nineteen other countries. She also danced on television and in a movie.
Wherever Tallchief danced, people celebrated her. They admired the feeling she put into her ballet dancing. She danced in a grand yet free way that set her apart from other ballerinas.
In 1965, at age forty-one, Tallchief grew tired from all her hard work. Nine years earlier, she had married Henry Paschen, and they had a daughter together. Tallchief stopped dancing and moved to Chicago to be with them. From 1975 to 1987, Tallchief was the creative director of two ballet companies in Chicago. Many of her students later became very successful in the world of ballet.
Tallchief also gave more time to the work of Balanchine, who died in 1983. She and several other Balanchine ballerinas worked together to record parts of his ballets. That way, ballet students could learn from them. In the late 1990s, Tallchief received several important awards for her work in the arts. She died at age eighty-eight on April 11, 2013, in Chicago. People around the world remember her life and talents.
As the first prima ballerina in the United States, Maria Tallchief helped inspire a new style of ballet. As ballet’s first Native American star, she opened its doors to people of all backgrounds. Her grace, talent, and achievement helped move the world of ballet forward. Another dancer once said of Tallchief, “There is one word for her: grand.”",910.0
" Fraternal twins may share some characteristics. In fact, they can share the same number of characteristics as any siblings. For example, sisters born a few years apart might both have light hair and blue eyes. However, another pair of sisters might have different hair and eye colors. It is the same with fraternal twins—they can look very similar, a little alike, or very different.
Fraternal twins are more likely to have different personalities, too. Any similarities they may share most likely come from being the same age and growing up together.
Whether identical or fraternal, twins often develop a special bond, or relationship. This bond begins early on, even before the twins are born. It is common for twins to interact with each other during the time they spend developing in their mother’s body. They move around and reach out for each other. After twins are born, they continue to bond with each other. As infants, twins may often be comforted by having their sibling near them.
As babies, some twins invent their own language. They use nonsense words and make up words that imitate sounds to communicate with each other. Once they learn a real language, the made-up language usually goes away.
Only some twins look almost exactly alike. Sometimes twins have other similarities instead, such as personalities and interests. Other times, such as in the case of fraternal twins, they can look and act very differently from each other. Despite any differences, twins often share a bond even before they are born.
Twins are not simply copies of each other. Each twin, whether identical or fraternal, is an individual person. Even though some twins might look similar, or enjoy the same things, every twin is truly one of a kind.",941.0

Others place his stories in today’s world, showing how timeless they are. From the world’s most famous actors to children putting on a play, Shakespeare has something for everyone.
Shakespeare wrote one hundred fifty-four sonnets. A sonnet is a special type of rhyming poem with fourteen lines. His sonnets were mostly about love. His most famous sonnet began with the line, “Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?”
After Shakespeare died in 1616, his friends put together a book of his thirty-six plays. It was the first time that eighteen of the plays were published. Shakespeare’s plays might have been lost if his friends hadn’t saved them. The book became popular all over the world. His friend, Ben Johnson, described Shakespeare’s work in the book as “not of an age, but for all time!” He was right. Hundreds of years later, people still relate to Shakespeare’s work.
Today, William Shakespeare is considered one of the greatest writers who ever lived. His plays are exciting and fun, and they also touch people’s feelings. His characters show how difficult—and how beautiful—life can be and what it means to be human. People around the world have enjoyed Shakespeare’s works for hundreds of years. They will continue to do so for hundreds of years to come.",824.0
"” Morty’s sister looked at him, puzzled.
“Are you going into town tomorrow?” Morty asked Grandpa. “I am planning a little mail and grocery run,” Grandpa said. “Would any mice like to ride along?” “Well,” Morty paused and swallowed hard, “mother gave us some spending money, and I would like to use mine to get some new play clothes for my sister. Would we have a minute or two to pick some up?” “I think we can arrange that,” Grandpa agreed. “Perhaps Grandma will join us to help you pick those out.” “Sure, honey.” Grandma smiled warmly.
Morty’s little sister started to calm down. Morty looked her in the eyes and said quietly, “After we come back from town, I was thinking about teaching you to inline skate. My skates will be a little big, but we can stuff some socks into them.” A small smile spread across Morty’s little sister’s face. “After all,” he added, “you helped bring them to the farm, right?” Later that night, Morty snuggled in bed with his little sister since she did not have her blanket. He was in his Mega Mouse boxers and an old T-shirt. She looked very cool in his “Mega Mouse Saves the World” T-shirt.
“Morty,” she asked sleepily, “tomorrow will you help me make a doll house with your snappy blocks?” “Sure. I think I know how to make a doll house,” Morty said. It wouldn’t be much more difficult than a monster mansion, he thought. Morty’s little sister gave him a great big hug and then slowly drifted off to sleep while he read to her from his newest Adventures of Mega Mouse comic book.",664.0

Route 66 is truly a land of giants. A California factory sold thousands of huge statues to businesses to use for advertising. The factory added costumes to turn the giants into cowboys, astronauts, and even chickens. Many of the biggest statues on Route 66 are food statues. Huge oranges, donuts, cheeseburgers, and ice cream cones might make your mouth water. Look out the window in Illinois to see the largest catsup bottle in the world!
Route 66 is home to prehistoric creatures of all shapes and sizes. One of these giants might be the largest concrete dinosaur in America. He is 150 feet (45.7 m) long and lives at a dinosaur park in California. Claude Bell built the park to draw visitors to his nearby restaurant, the Wheel Inn.
Saving Route 66
As more people visited Route 66, heavy traffic caused damage to the highway. From 1956 through the 1980s, new interstates—high-speed highways with many lanes—were built around Route 66. But as more travelers took interstates, businesses on Route 66 lost customers, and many closed. Peeling paint and boarded-up windows became common sights. In 1999, the United States Congress passed a law to protect Route 66. It gave money to help businesses and towns keep important sights open. Now Route 66 is growing popular again. The best way to catch the spirit of Route 66 is to drive it. You’re sure to have an unforgettable American experience of your own!",888.0
" He permitted their religion. The Egyptians welcomed him. Alexander decided to move farther into Asia, east of Asia Minor. In what is Iraq today, the final battle with the Persians took place in 331 BC. Darius again fled the battlefield after losing to the Macedonians. Now Alexander ruled the Persian Empire. He traveled through Persia trying to find Darius. Before Alexander could find him, however, Darius was killed by a local leader.
As Alexander gained control of more land and people, he started following Persian customs and asked his men to do the same. He began to demand that the Macedonians bow to him as the Persians did. Many Macedonians did not like Alexander’s new ways.
The Macedonian army struggled in 326 BC in the land they called India (Afghanistan and Pakistan now) as they moved farther east. After winning a difficult battle, Alexander continued on through India. He was badly injured along the way but managed to recover. Alexander pushed his men to keep moving, even though it caused them great danger. After fighting for nearly ten years, many of Alexander’s men were tired and wanted to go home. They finally convinced him to turn around. They made it to Babylon in 323 BC. However, Alexander came down with a fever, and in June of that year, Alexander the Great died, just before he turned thirty-three.
Alexander’s empire included parts of Europe, Asia, and Africa. His life was not just about taking control of land and ruling people. Perhaps because of his early education, he learned the traditions of his new empire, and in turn, he and the Macedonians spread Greek culture in new lands. Alexander became a role model for the rulers and explorers who followed. He opened doors to new places and helped create an exchange of new ideas.",933.0
" Still, after nearly six months of hiking, I completed the A.T.! On October 1, 2016, I summited Mount Katahdin. While my last days on the trail were difficult, they were unlike my first. I felt strong and confident. As a child, I rarely played sports, but after thru-hiking, I felt proud that I could call myself an athlete.
Since I finished my hike, many people have asked me about my favorite memories. One is from a night when I was camping alone on a mountaintop. Strong winds and heavy rain caused my tent to collapse. I became frustrated and afraid. At 3:00 a.m., I gave up trying to sleep and packed up, ate breakfast, and started hiking. What followed was the most amazing sunrise I had ever seen. A scary experience had transformed into something beautiful. Many people have asked me, “How did you do it?” I tell them that I did it the same way you do anything else: one step at a time. People have also asked me, “Why did you do it?” Looking back, the reasons I kept going were different from my reasons when I began. The love and support from those around me and at home made me never want to stop.
I’m writing this book several months after finishing my thru-hike. My knees still hurt from hiking those five million steps. I was away from people I love for six months. So you might be wondering, was it worth it? I took a big risk and did something I had always wanted to do. I planned, saved money, and lived on a tight budget. I learned to value every item I carried because my life depended on it. In spite of the challenges, in the end, thru-hiking the A.T. was an amazing experience.",836.0
" They got through them together. While his political career was winding down, though, hers was ramping up.
In 2000, Hillary Clinton ran to become a U.S. senator for New York. She won easily, becoming the first female senator from that state. After terrorists attacked New York City on September 11, 2001, Senator Clinton worked to get money to help the city recover. She also voted for U.S. military action in Afghanistan and Iraq. She was re-elected easily in 2006.
The next year, Clinton announced that she was running for U.S. president in the 2008 election. Her chances seemed good to win the Democratic nomination. For months, she was in a close contest with Senator Barack Obama from Illinois. Obama narrowly beat her, then went on to become president with Clinton’s support.
President Obama named Hillary Clinton to be his secretary of state, one of the most important positions in the U.S. government. Clinton oversaw relations between the United States and other countries. She was only the third woman ever to hold the position. She traveled to meet leaders in 112 countries— more than any other U.S. secretary of state. Clinton left the position in 2013 after President Obama’s reelection. However, there was one more race she wanted to run.
In April 2015, Hillary Clinton announced that she was running for U.S. president. She officially won the Democratic nomination in late July 2016. In November, Americans went to the polls to cast their votes for president. In the end Hillary Clinton lost to Donald Trump, the Republican nominee. Throughout her life, Hillary Clinton has broken through barriers that have blocked many women from pursuing their dreams. Though she lost the presidential election, her life and work set a strong example for the girls and women who follow.",934.0
" One mouse waiting in line asked why they were giving away treats for free. “Well, we were trying to raise money for Adventure Rocks Mouse Camp, but . . .” Morty said before he was interrupted.
“Oh wow, I did that when I was your age,” one mouse said. “How great!” said another. “Here, I’d like to donate ten dollars for your registration fees,” a third mouse said. Soon all the mice in line were offering to donate money. “Really, we just want to make up for overcharging everyone. We can’t take your money,” Morty said. But after trying to refuse several times and mice still offering money, Morty, Ben, and Fred knew they needed to show they were grateful.
In the middle of the afternoon, they had run out of lemonade, brownies, and cookies, but somehow they had collected a huge pile of donated cash. “Your customers were generous today, Morty,” Morty’s father said when he collected the mice in the Mouse Minivan. “I hope you appreciate their kindness.” Morty looked at Ben and Fred, whose grins stretched from ear to ear. That evening Morty, Fred, and Ben counted the donations in Morty’s kitchen. “Two hundred ninety-eight, two hundred ninety-nine, three hundred,” Fred said as he placed the last bill on the table. Morty’s ears perked up. Three hundred dollars meant that each of them could go to camp for one day and take the ultimate adventure hike—crossing the canyon on a zip line, rappelling from the rocks, and shooting the rapids in a raft. “Wow,” Ben said.
“Yeah,” agreed Morty and Fred. “Your customers understood you were trying to make right what you had done wrong,” Morty’s father said from the doorway, grinning with pride at Morty. “Let’s take it to the limit!” Morty said to his best buddies.",786.0
" We looked out the window, and the MacIntoshes’ house had been ripped right off its foundation, creaking and groaning as it floated away. Then like a sinking ship, it spun and tipped over, crash ! I was friends with the little MacIntosh girl, Amy. She and her mom grabbed onto the couch and ended up on the beach in Tonset, alive. They never saw her father or brother again.” Suddenly there was a horrible screaming sound, and Kevin leapt about two feet into the air.
“Pie’s done!” Grandma announced, getting to her feet and shuffling into the kitchen—it was only the oven timer. Her voice floated out of the kitchen with the warm smell of cinnamon. “Not scaring you, am I? Heck, I’m scared myself; no good having all your children out in weather like this.” Kevin walked to the window and cupped his hands over his eyes. The only thing visible was the cone of falling snow under the streetlamp. He imagined that outside that bit of light, the waves were beginning to crawl up the shore, lapping toward the house. Yes, there it was—he was sure he saw the white edge of a wave slipping onto the road, splashing into bright flecks of spray. His heart pounded as the shape shifted and grew, and just before he was about to run to his grandmother, he realized what he saw: headlights. The lights from a car shone on the enormous snowflakes, making them look like the moving front of a wave. It was his parents’ car pulling into the driveway, with Bob and Nancy in the back seat.

" Their plans were upset by the amazing gold-medal triumph of runner Jesse Owens, an African American. In 1972, terrorists took nine of Israel’s Olympic athletes hostage. Seventeen people were killed. At the 1996 Games, a bomb killed one person and hurt more than one hundred others.
Today’s Olympic athletes are stronger than ever because of advances in equipment and training. In 1924, the winner of the men’s 50-kilometer (31-mi) cross-country ski race won in 3 hours and 45 minutes. In 2010, the winner of the same race finished in 2 hours and 5 minutes. For many Olympic athletes, training is almost a full-time job. Athletes often begin their training while they are still young. Many countries have built special Olympic training centers for their athletes to use. The pressure to win can be strong. Some athletes try to gain an unfair advantage by cheating. Some have secretly used drugs to win.
Officials test Olympic athletes for drug use. Winners who fail a drug test can lose their medals. Marion Jones was a great track star from the United States who won five medals at the 2000 Summer Olympics. She had to return all her medals when she admitted using drugs to run faster. Judges sometimes cheat to help their countries win. Some give the wrong points to athletes on purpose. Other judges cheat by trading points with judges from other countries.
Olympic organizers work hard to keep the Games honest and fair for everyone. The Olympics continue to grow bigger and more popular. Many people enjoy watching the world’s best athletes compete. And the Games often have amazing surprises. But the wonder of the Olympics comes from their rich history. The Olympics show that peaceful sporting contests among different countries are still exciting, even after all these centuries!",875.0
" The story also says that their gods told them to find a new place to live. After looking for two hundred years, they founded a city that is now known as Mexico City.
Some historians think that Mexcaltitán (mes-kahl-tee-TAHN) is where the Aztec people came from. This small human-made island is in the same place as the Aztec island shown on a 1579 map. Also, the early people used small canoes almost exactly like the ones used there today. Mexcaltitán is home to about eight hundred people. This water town is sometimes called the Mexican Venice. In summer, during the rainy season, boats are the only way to travel through the streets. Children play “water soccer” on the island’s underwater soccer field.
This city of 1.5 million people is on the North Island of New Zealand in the South Pacific Ocean. It is located between two large harbors on an isthmus less than 2 kilometers (1.24 mi.) wide at its narrowest point. Auckland’s nickname is the “City of Sails.” About one-sixth of its residents own a boat. The city has thousands of beaches. Water- related activities include swimming, surfing, fishing, diving, kayaking, and beach horseback riding.
Many kinds of water cities exist besides the ones you’ve just read about. For instance, Italy has a tiny fishing town with brightly colored homes built on steep cliffs. Northern California has a floating community made up of houseboats. People in the military may spend months living on aircraft carriers. Water means different things to different people. For residents of water cities, it may mean fun, work, safety, a connection with nature, or a way of life. The world’s water cities are proof that people can make a home for themselves just about anywhere.",900.0
" For liquid waste, astronauts use a tube with a nozzle. For solid waste, astronauts must use foot straps and handles to stay in place. The toilet takes the waste from the opening or tube to where it is stored.
Astronauts use water and special soap on a cloth to wash their bodies. They wash their hair with shampoo that uses no water. To clean their teeth, they use toothpaste that can be swallowed when they’re finished.
Astronauts on the ISS might play cards, read, or write, among other things. Talking with loved ones is also important. Astronauts are able to make calls and use video chats. Sometimes astronauts answer questions from students all over the world or give video tours of the station. Many just look out the windows or take photos. Who can blame them? The view is pretty amazing.
When people exercise on Earth, their bones and muscles must work against gravity, which makes them stronger. The lack of gravity in space makes it very easy to move things. Because of this ease, astronauts’ bones and muscles weaken over time. Astronauts must exercise at least two hours every day. Even with a daily workout, their bones and muscles are weaker when they return to Earth.
When astronauts return to Earth, the work isn’t over. After a six-month stay on the ISS, it takes six weeks of exercise to regain their strength. It can take a whole year for an astronaut’s bones to fully recover. Astronauts have to work hard, but the time spent living and working in space is worth it. Scientists always keep track of the astronauts’ physical and mental health. The information they gather has already helped astronauts live healthier and happier lives. This information might mean the success or failure of future space travel.",847.0

With no antivenin, Jennifer was unconscious for most of three days. When she was conscious, she felt a terrible burning pain that wouldn’t stop. The side of her body that was struck by the rattlesnake was very swollen and bruised. The skin was so tight from the swelling that she thought it might burst. For some people, the swelling gets so bad that they have to have surgery to reduce the pressure. About one-fourth of people need other surgery to clean out dead tissue that was destroyed by the venom.
Jennifer rested for months when she was finally able to go home. Three weeks after her rattlesnake strike, most of her symptoms had become less severe. Her hand and arm were still swollen and had dark, peeling skin. After she healed more, she had three skin grafts to close the wound. Some snakebite victims also need other surgeries to get blood flowing again in the area of the strike. About one-quarter never regain the full use of the damaged body part. Sadly, sometimes tissue damage is so bad that a body part must be removed.
Rattlesnakes are part of the web of life and an important link in many food chains. Without rattlesnakes, the numbers of mice and other small animals would become too large, and nature’s balance would be upset. Like all other living things, rattlesnakes have a right to live. Although they can be frightening, rattlesnakes are only a danger to people who startle or threaten them. When you are in rattlesnake country, respect the creatures that live there. It’s not much different from respecting the rules when you visit a friend’s home. Keep your eyes open for rattlesnakes, think about their habits, and you will be safe.",956.0
" He checked the maze paths near Javi’s cries, but he didn’t find Javier. He then went back to the next junction and went right because he had come from the left. As the path looped in front of Carlos, he could see Javier’s running shoes sticking out from where the corn curved.
Javier looked like he had been trying to pull himself up, but had twisted his ankle badly in a hollow worn in the dirt path. “So, little bro, you got here fast,” Javier said, cracking a grin. “You must not have been too far ahead of me.” “Let’s just get you out of here,” said Carlos as Javier threw his arm around Carlos’s shoulders to support his weight.
As they walked, Javi boasted about how he was running down the path with his mind on the exit so he didn’t see the hole. He was going so fast, and it was such a surprise. “Not even Hercules could have stopped himself from going down.” “Crash and burn,” Javier said. “It was a fantastic wipeout!” “I’m glad you weren’t too far ahead,” he continued. “I tried to walk, but when I tried to put weight on my ankle, it just gave out. I surely wasn’t going to hop all the way out.”
“Actually, big bro, I was almost out when I heard you yelling,” Carlos said quietly. Javier looked up. He could see the exit clearly. His storytelling had distracted him from the fact that they were still inside the maze and still in the contest. “Well, what do you know?” Javier said, looking his little brother in the eye. “It looks like I’m doing chores for a month.” Carlos saw the flash of pride in Javier’s eyes before it disappeared.

" Once they have an idea about how to solve a problem, budding inventors often talk to their parents, friends, or teachers about it. “Advice I often give kids I meet is to not be afraid to ask someone for help,” says Hart Main. He didn’t know how to make candles, so he talked to someone who did.
As a next step, inventors often build a model of their invention. They might show it at a school science fair. A trip to a larger gathering, such as a Maker Faire, might follow. Maker Faires are like big show-and- tells for all ages, where inventors share their ideas and creations. Students in grades five to eight can go to yearly competitions such as “America’s Top Young Scientist.” The grand prize is $25,000. Peyton Robertson, eleven, won this title for an improved sandbag. Sandbags can protect places from flooding, but carrying heavy sandbags and putting enough into place can be hard and take a lot of time. Peyton’s invention is lighter than a regular sandbag. It gets bigger when it absorbs water and protects better against flooding.
Building robots is another way that young inventors develop their skills. The National Robotics Challenge is open to students from elementary school on up. Kids in grades four to eight may enter the U.S. FIRST LEGO League championships. During these competitions, teams of students build robots that can complete a series of tasks on their own. The team that creates the most successful robot wins. Robotics competitions help kids learn teamwork, collaboration, creativity, and problem solving. Inventing is an awesome activity. With their inventions, kids solve everyday problems and make people’s lives better and easier. Maybe you will be the next great inventor.",986.0

Many different types of animals live in Mexico. The jaguar plays an important role in the stories, songs, and prayers of Mexico’s ancient Indian people. It lives mainly in the rainforests of Mexico. The largest of all the cat species in North America, it can measure about 2 meters (6 ft.) in length. It has black spots and a roar that sounds like a loud cough. Unlike many other cats, the jaguar likes to swim, play, and hunt in water. Its main source of food is the peccary, a small, wild member of the pig family. Sadly, the jaguar is in danger of extinction; however, many people are trying to save them.
The sacred bird of the ancient Maya and the Aztec, the quetzal (keht-SAHL) lives in the rainforests of Mexico. Like many types of birds, the male is brightly colored, and the female is plainer in appearance. The male’s head and chest are bright golden green. Its back is blue, its belly is red, and its tail feathers can be more than 1 meter (3 ft.) long. In the mountains of Mexico lives the red-knee tarantula. This large, hairy spider is named for the reddish-orange patches on its leg joints. The legs of this large spider span 15 cm (6 in.). It grows very slowly, and the female spider can live to be thirty years old.
Mexico is a country of diversity. It has modern cities and ancient ruins. Deep canyons lie within high mountains. Dry deserts and wet rainforests cover the land.

" I’ll include fifty cents in each envelope to pay for yesterday’s paper.” The supervisor raised his eyebrows. “If the Gazette guarantees delivery by 6 a.m. and I kept that from happening, then I’m responsible for buying that morning’s paper.” The supervisor seemed to like the idea, so Morty forged on with the next part of his plan. “I am asking you not to punish Ben for my mistake. Please don’t count my mistake against his perfect record. I know how much it means to him to earn the trip to Magic Mouseland.”
It was quiet in the office for what seemed like a very long time. Finally the supervisor spoke. “Young mouse, rules are rules. That trip is for the very best paper carriers. Ben has been one of our best this year. Knowing it was you and not he who made the mistake changes things. I’ll give Ben a call and let him know that his record will not be affected.”
The next morning, Morty set his Mega Mouse alarm clock and got up to do the paper route with Ben. He was delivering his apology notes and refunds while Ben tossed his papers. “Ben, I now realize that delivering the morning paper is a difficult job,” Morty said. Ben smiled in spite of his heavy paper bags. “Well, Morty, I guess I won’t ask you to cover the route while I’m in Magic Mouseland.”
“I just don’t think I am ready to be a paper carrier,” Morty admitted. “It’s a good thing since the Gazette is the only paper in Mousetown,” Ben chuckled. “After this, there is no way they’ll ever hire you.” Morty laughed, too.

" Again, Saladin couldn’t stop them. Instead, he took his army to Jerusalem to strengthen it against Christian soldiers. However, the Christians never attacked. Richard realized his army wasn’t strong enough to take and hold the holy city. On September 2, 1192, Saladin’s brother and Richard agreed to a truce. Saladin let the Christians keep parts of the coast. The rest of the land, including Jerusalem, would be Muslim land. Christians would still be able to visit holy places. The battles were over. Saladin won lasting respect from the Christian world for his fair conduct.
Saladin went home to Damascus after the truce was signed. He died only six months later, on March 4, 1193, at age fifty-five. Because he never cared much for money, he had given everything away. There was no money to bury his body. He was later buried in a building constructed by his son in Damascus. After Saladin’s death, his family continued to rule over Egypt and nearby lands until 1250. At that point, another group gained power.
Saladin was a great leader who was kind to his enemies. After he took back Jerusalem from the Crusaders, he let Christians continue to visit the holy city. He also let the Christians keep some of the land they took. The time in history when Saladin lived was known for fierce battles. Still, one of its most respected leaders is remembered for being fair. Just before Saladin died, he spoke with his oldest son.

" When this happens, huge storms form. These storms have different names, depending on where in the world they occur. Look at the world map to see what these storms are called in different parts of the world.
These huge storms can be hundreds of miles across. They have three parts. In the center is the eye of the storm, where the air is calm. The eye is surrounded by a wall of swirling clouds containing strong, violent winds. These winds whirling around the center can reach over 322 kilometers per hour (200 mph). The third part is the rain bands, which are bands of thunderclouds that reach out from the wall and produce heavy rain. The damage from these storms is done by wind and flooding. When these large storms reach land, they push large mounds of water ahead of them. When these mounds of water hit land, boats and buildings may be swept away and destroyed. The heavy amount of rain can also cause serious flooding.
The most fierce winter storm is called a blizzard. This is a storm that has heavy snowfall and high winds of over 56 kilometers per hour (35 mph). Sometimes visibility is so limited that the blizzard is called a whiteout. Blizzards can dump several feet of snow quickly. This snow blows around and piles up into huge drifts of up to 15.2 meters (50 ft).
These fierce storms can collapse buildings, bury cars and trucks, and knock out electrical power. In the mountains, heavy snowfall can lead to avalanches. Avalanches are huge walls of snow that break loose and tumble down a mountainside. They have been known to bury entire villages.
It pays to know what to do when a storm is coming. It can save your life. Here are some safety tips.",798.0
" The weight of the water caused the ship to sink.
Robert tried to protect the Titanic from treasure hunters. He did not want anyone to take the things that belonged to the ship or its passengers. But in the following year, salvagers took away thousands of items from the ship. Some of the items were placed in an exhibit. Robert Ballard is still protecting the Titanic. Every time someone explores the shipwreck, the remains are damaged more. Robert’s goal is to get governments to sign a treaty, or agreement, saying that no one may take anything from the ship. Robert believes the Titanic should be respected as a memorial to those who died aboard it. The United Kingdom and the United States have both signed this treaty.
After the Titanic tragedy, shipbuilders no longer believed a ship could truly be unsinkable. Crews became better trained to take care of passengers in emergency situations. People learned the importance of putting enough life jackets and lifeboats on each ship for all passengers. The Titanic also taught people about the incredible power of the ocean. Scientists have discovered that the shipwreck’s metal is being eaten away by tiny bits of rust. Tourists and divers have also added to the ship’s problems, littering it with everything from artificial flowers to soda bottles.
Protecting the Titanic is a way to protect history. The original artifacts on the ship tell a story that needs to be heard as it really happened. Every time people remove something from the Titanic or add something to its remains, they change history. Whenever this happens, it becomes harder to tell what happened to those 2,200 passengers over one hundred years ago.",982.0

On February 20, 1962, John Glenn blasted out of Earth’s atmosphere. He orbited the planet three times and splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean. Finally, it seemed that the U.S. space program had matched the Soviets’. Soon NASA’s technology for piloted space travel would surpass theirs. Katherine Johnson’s research continued to be instrumental to NASA’s missions. Her calculations helped take astronauts to the Moon in the late 1960s as part of the Apollo Program. She figured out the trajectories for the mission. She calculated the meeting of the lunar lander and the space capsule that would carry the astronauts home again. Katherine was honored with an American flag that the crew had taken to the Moon. Johnson later supported the space shuttle program by calculating shuttle trajectories. She retired from NASA in 1986. When asked about her job with the space program, she simply said how much she loved the work.
Katherine Johnson tackled a different mission after retirement. She traveled to schools to talk to young people about her career. She also wanted to share her enthusiasm for science and math. In 2015, she was invited to the White House at the age of ninety-seven. There, President Barack Obama presented her with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the country’s highest civilian honor. He spoke of her as a “pioneer who broke the barriers of race and gender.” He also honored her for showing “that everyone can excel at math and science and reach for the stars.”
In 2017, NASA honored her in yet another way. They opened the Katherine G. Johnson Computational Research Facility at Langley Research Center. Her abilities were once doubted because she was a black woman. Now she is celebrated for her contributions to some of the country’s greatest scientific achievements.",954.0
" “I’m Miranda James.” “I know,” said the face in the mirror. The face belonged to a boy that seemed to be about twelve years old. In fact, the face looked like Miranda’s—if she had been a boy. “I’ve been trying to reach you,” said James. “I sent you a message on the mirror, but my first attempt wasn’t strong enough. Only my... our name made it through.” “James Miranda! On the mirror! So I wasn’t making it up. It really happened.” “It is still happening,” James said.
“Whoa! This is freaky. And awesome, just like a real science fiction story! You are me but in some bizarre parallel universe where things are backward or inside-out or...” “Spirit twins is what we call them in my world,” explained James. “Only a select few have them, which means that this is a rare gift.” Then he explained about brain waves intersecting in a black hole in outer space, and why he had chosen to make himself known to Miranda, and how it would give him an actual true-life story of adventure to write. Miranda was enraptured and took down everything James said. This was something no one was going to believe so she made sure she captured every word.
Miranda managed to capture the details of her talk with James in her journal, and the journal grew into a book. Her first book, Pen Pal in the Looking Glass, became a bestseller because the “mirror world” she wrote about was so believable. Miranda’s critics said that her story blended science with fiction in such a way that it was hard to tell where the science ended and the fiction began. As a published science-fiction writer, Miranda finally joined the ranks of other authors with big dreams and imaginations.",847.0

There’s the starting horn! The outriders leap into action. They fling poles and a rubber “stove” into the back of each wagon. The wagon teams blast away at a gallop. The outriders leap onto their horses and race after the wagons. The bouncing, rattling, clanging wagons do a dangerous figure-8 around barrels. Then they race around the track at full speed! Pounding horse hooves and rattling wagons shake the grandstand seats. As they race to the finish line, the crowd is on its feet, with everyone cheering on their favorite team. The first team of horses blasts across the finish line, outriders racing right behind. The first place team wins $100,000 in what’s often called the roughest event in rodeo.
It’s been an exhausting but eye-opening ten days at the Calgary Stampede. If you visit for even one day, you’ll be amazed at the huge size of this event. Each year, the stampede involves thousands of workers, volunteers, and participants. It’s a lot of hard work to put on a show of this size. But there’s no question that all these people will be back again next year to help out. The Calgary Stampede is the pride of Calgary. It’s a unique and memorable way for a city to celebrate. The Stampede celebrates its history, brings its people together, and shows the world what the Canadian West is all about.",746.0
" Becky, who had heard it also, managed to creep upstairs earlier than usual. She wanted to get away from people and go and look at the little magic room once more. She did not know what would happen to it. It was not likely that it would be left to Miss Minchin. It would be taken away, and the attic would be bare and empty again.
Glad as she was for Sara’s sake, she went up the last flight of stairs with a lump in her throat and tears blurring her sight. There would be no fire tonight, and no rosy lamp; no supper, and no princess sitting in the glow reading or telling stories—no princess! She choked down a sob as she pushed the attic door open, and then she broke into a low cry. The lamp was flushing the room, the fire was blazing, the supper was waiting; and Ram Dass was standing smiling into her startled face. “Missee Sahib remembered,” he said. “She told the Sahib all. She wished you to know the good fortune which has befallen her. Behold a letter on the tray. She has written. She did not wish that you should go to sleep unhappy. The Sahib commands you to come to him tomorrow. You are to be the attendant of Missee Sahib. Tonight I take these things back over the roof.” And having said this with a beaming face, he made a little salaam and slipped through the skylight with an agile silentness of movement which showed Becky how easily he had done it before.",877.0
"” “But suppose we cannot?” said the girl. “Then I shall never have courage,” declared the Lion. “And I shall never have brains,” added the Scarecrow. “And I shall never have a heart,” spoke the Tin Woodman. “And I shall never see Aunt Em and Uncle Henry,” said Dorothy, beginning to cry. “Be careful!” cried the green girl. “The tears will fall on your green silk gown and spot it.”
So Dorothy dried her eyes and said, “I suppose we must try it; but I am sure I do not want to kill anybody, even to see Aunt Em again.” “I will go with you; but I’m too much of a coward to kill the Witch,” said the Lion. “I will go too,” declared the Scarecrow; “but I shall not be of much help to you, I am such a fool.” “I haven’t the heart to harm even a Witch,” remarked the Tin Woodman; “but if you go I certainly shall go with you.” Therefore it was decided to start upon their journey the next morning, and the Woodman sharpened his axe on a green grindstone and had all his joints properly oiled. The Scarecrow stuffed himself with fresh straw and Dorothy put new paint on his eyes that he might see better. The green girl, who was very kind to them, filled Dorothy’s basket with good things to eat, and fastened a little bell around Toto’s neck with a green ribbon. They went to bed quite early and slept soundly until daylight, when they were awakened by the crowing of a green cock that lived in the backyard of the Palace, and the cackling of a hen that had laid a green egg.",860.0
"” Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so she turned to the Mock Turtle, and said, “What else had you to learn?” “Well, there was Mystery,” the Mock Turtle replied, counting off the subjects on his flappers, “—Mystery, ancient and modern, with Seaography: then Drawling—the Drawling master was an old conger eel, that used to come once a week: he taught us Drawling, Stretching, and Fainting in Coils.” “What was that like?” said Alice. “Well, I can’t show it you myself,” the Mock Turtle said. “I’m too stiff. And the Gryphon never learnt it.” “Hadn’t time,” said the Gryphon. “I went to the Classics master, though. He was an old crab, he was.” “I never went to him,” the Mock Turtle said with a sigh. “He taught Laughing and Grief, they used to say.” “So he did, so he did,” said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn; and both creatures hid their faces in their paws.
“And how many hours a day did you do lessons?” said Alice, in a hurry to change the subject. “Ten hours the first day,” said the Mock Turtle, “nine the next, and so on.” “What a curious plan!” exclaimed Alice. “That’s the reason they’re called lessons,” the Gryphon remarked: “because they lessen from day to day.” This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a little before she made her next remark. “Then the eleventh day must have been a holiday?” “Of course it was,” said the Mock Turtle. “And how did you manage on the twelfth?” Alice went on eagerly. “That’s enough about lessons,” the Gryphon interrupted in a very decided tone. “Tell her something about the games now.”",680.0
" With the sturdy horses sheltering us, everything now seemed bearable. Just as quickly as it had begun, the snow stopped, and the dim sky grew brighter. We could finally see the open space where all the other horses had gathered, their heads lowered over a shape on the ground. The mother horse was half sitting up. Next to her was a tiny, dark body, all folded up in pointy angles. The mother licked it, but it didn’t move. Then she gave it a nudge with her nose. Its big knees jerked, and a little head popped up on a long, thin neck. Stephan laughed. “The foal is alive—they both made it!” Gently, the mother encouraged her foal to stand but the tiny bundle swayed on his knees and shook his head.
Our concentration was disrupted by mom’s research helicopter swooping in to land. Some of the horses startled, and ran away. Mom tumbled out and ran toward us. “Girls, you’re all right!” she cried, trying to gather us up in an awkward hug. “I’m sorry I scared the horses,” she said into Mimi’s hair. “And I didn’t mean to ignore you,” she added, looking over at me. “I just didn’t understand that the horses matter to you in the same way that the seals matter to me,” she said. She smiled proudly at me, and it seemed as though she really did understand. We named the new foal Miracle and watched him take his first determined steps. Everything felt newly born and fragile to me, not just the little foal. It seemed so unlikely that any of us should be there at the time—yet, right then it was as if we all belonged on Sable Island.",746.0

Tomorrow morning you shall have a real treat. All the time you’re eating your breakfast, I’ll repeat ‘The Walrus and the Carpenter’ to you; and then you can make believe it’s oysters, dear! “Now, Kitty, let’s consider who it was that dreamed it all. This is a serious question, my dear, and you should not go on licking your paw like that—as if Dinah hadn’t washed you this morning! “You see, Kitty, it must have been either me or the Red King.

Autumn frosts have slain July. Still she haunts me, phantomwise, Alice moving under skies Never seen by waking eyes.

" At the two-yard peg she faced round, and said, “A pawn goes two squares in its first move, you know. So you’ll go very quickly through the Third Square—by railway, I should think—and you’ll find yourself in the Fourth Square in no time. Well, that square belongs to Tweedledum and Tweedledee—the Fifth is mostly water—the Sixth belongs to Humpty Dumpty—But you make no remark?” “I—I didn’t know I had to make one—just then,” Alice faltered out. “You should have said, ‘It’s extremely kind of you to tell me all this’—however, we’ll suppose it said—the Seventh Square is all forest—however, one of the Knights will show you the way—and in the Eighth Square we shall be Queens together, and it’s all feasting and fun!” Alice got up and curtseyed, and sat down again. At the next peg the Queen turned again, and this time she said, “Speak in French when you can’t think of the English for a thing—turn out your toes as you walk—and remember who you are!” She did not wait for Alice to curtsey this time, but walked on quickly to the next peg, where she turned for a moment to say “good-bye,” and then hurried on to the last. How it happened, Alice never knew, but exactly as she came to the last peg, she was gone. Whether she vanished into the air, or whether she ran quickly into the wood (“and she can run very fast!” thought Alice), there was no way of guessing, but she was gone, and Alice began to remember that she was a Pawn, and that it would soon be time for her to move.",1100.0
" He was trapped in a ring of death. As Caesar whirled to face attack after attack, he suddenly saw Brutus and Decimus—his dear friends—with daggers lifted in their hands. A great silence seemed to enclose him then. They, too? he thought with sudden clarity. Even Brutus? Decimus? This is betrayal. This is the end. And covering his face in his regal toga, Julius Caesar sank beneath dozens of dagger blows, collapsing on the Senate floor. He died there, bleeding from more than twenty wounds.
The conspirators drew back a little, awestruck by what they had just done. Caesar’s friend Mark Antony, who had heard rumors of the plot against Caesar, burst through the doors of the Senate House with a look of desperation, but he was too late. Upon seeing Caesar on the floor, his face sank and became gray with grief. He turned slowly and stumbled out in a quiet state of horror, back into the unsuspecting crowd, which awaited the return of its beloved leader.
Though Brutus, Decimus, Cassius, and the rest of the conspirators believed that they had freed Rome from a great tyrant, the liberation did not go according to plan. The Gallic legions, enraged at Caesar’s murder, rose up in revolt against the conspirators and their allies. The result was yet another civil war between a pro-Caesar faction led by Mark Antony and an anti-Caesar faction led by the conspirators. In the end, the conspirators were defeated, and Caesar’s adopted son Octavian became the first emperor of Rome. In assassinating Caesar, the conspirators did not save the Roman Republic.

“Now I must send you home for the night—it may not be safe here for long,” Pierre said as he concealed the radio in its bag. When he returned, the three gathered their belongings, headed for the door and listened. Pierre lit a lantern and scanned the darkness. Satisfied, he signaled Aimee and Jacques, who scampered down the gravel road leading away from the barn, every step putting more distance between them and the illegal transmitter. In the darkness, Pierre waved goodbye to his new friends.
“We’re almost there,” Jacques said excitedly, “and Marie has soup waiting for us.” “That sounds wonder—” He stopped suddenly. “What is it, Jacques?” “Someone’s coming,” he whispered. “I don’t hear any—” Aimee gasped, as two intimidating German soldiers suddenly emerged from the darkness with their guns drawn. She was sure that “guilty” was written across her face. A light blinded her eyes then moved on to Jacques. She flinched as it blinded her again and then returned to Jacques. She felt Jacques clutch her arm like a steel trap, but she was already protecting him as best she could. Jacques put up his own defense: look as helpless as possible by reaching out into space with his free hand. Would the men fall for this well-rehearsed act?
One soldier grumbled in German, “It’s only the blind kid,” which made the other one nod in agreement, and the two of them moved on. “Nice work,” Aimee whispered, now a safe distance from the threat. Jacques smiled, his head held high. “If they only knew.”",862.0
" There it is, using its tusks to clear paths through snow, probably searching for plant food. The woolly mammoth stands almost 12 feet (3.6 m) tall, but another Mammuthus species can grow as tall as 14 feet (4.3 m).

Isn’t it amazing to think that giants such as the ones in this book once walked on Earth and swam in the ocean? It’s too bad we can’t see these huge creatures today. However, you don’t have to get in a time machine to see very large animals. Blue whales, great white sharks, giant squids, grizzly bears, elephants, giraffes, ostriches, condors, and anacondas are some of the large animals that share the planet with us today. Unfortunately, many of these animals are threatened with extinction because their populations are so small. It’s important to protect these animals, mainly by preserving their habitats. That way, we can be sure that we’ll never live in a world without giants.",896.0

You’ve been moping all day, not talking to anyone, and you can’t leave me in the dark.”
Hazel sighed and explained everything to Malcolm. He sat quietly and listened. “Wow,” he sighed when she finished. “This might be the first of my theories that’s proven true. My mind is blown.” “That’s it?” Hazel snapped. “That’s all you can say about this?” Malcolm shrugged. “What can we do about it? We leave here in some sort of quiet protest, and we lose our college funding, but we get to keep the moral high ground.” Hazel looked at her feet—she really needed the funding to afford school. “I guess you could leave and tell the press,” he continued. “The program would likely be shut down, and Buckland Wildlife would be killed in the media. Buckland would likely come after you and your family with the ‘severe’ consequences that lawyer guy talked about.” Hazel’s eyes burned as tears rolled down her cheeks. After a while, people started leaving the cafeteria and heading back to work. Malcolm finished his sandwich before he spoke again.
“Or you could do what I’m going to do, and accept a less than perfect situation for the greater good of all.” “Not all,” Hazel said. “Not all,” Malcolm agreed, “but when has anything ever been for the good of all?” Hazel didn’t know.

" Yellow, meagre, ragged, scowling, wolfish; but prostrate, too, in their humility. Graceful youth should have filled their features out, and touched them with its freshest tints. Instead, a stale and shrivelled hand, like that of age, had pinched, and twisted them, and pulled them into shreds.
Where angels might have sat enthroned, devils lurked, and glared out menacing. No change, no degradation, no perversion of humanity, in any grade, through all the mysteries of wonderful creation, has monsters half so horrible and dread. Scrooge started back, appalled.

This boy is Ignorance. This girl is Want. Beware them both, and all of their degree, but most of all beware this boy, for on his brow I see that written which is Doom, unless the writing be erased.

The day had grown more white, until the sun shed his full radiance upon the thronged forest. A sort of a gust of battle came sweeping toward that part of the line where lay the youth’s regiment. The front shifted a trifle to meet it squarely. There was a wait. In this part of the field there passed slowly the intense moments that precede the tempest.
A single rifle flashed in a thicket before the regiment. In an instant it was joined by many others. There was a mighty song of clashes and crashes that went sweeping through the woods. The guns in the rear, aroused and enraged by shells that had been thrown burr-like at them, suddenly involved themselves in a hideous altercation with another band of guns. The battle roar settled to a rolling thunder, which was a single, long explosion. In the regiment there was a peculiar kind of hesitation denoted in the attitudes of the men.

" When an outbreak reaches this size, it is known as a pandemic—a disease that spreads rapidly around the world.
But the pandemic of 1918 was not the only major influenza outbreak in history. The Asian flu, which appeared in 1957, caused about 70,000 deaths in the United States. It got its name because it first appeared in China before coming to the United States in June 1957. Another strain of flu, the Hong Kong flu, was first detected in Hong Kong, China. In 1968, this virus caused another pandemic, resulting in 34,000 deaths in just the United States—as many people as live in a small city. And in 2009, the H1N1 swine flu became the first pandemic in 41 years, infecting people in over 70 countries.
Other outbreaks have caused widespread concern without developing into actual pandemics. These include the Russian flu in 1977 and the avian flu in 1997 and 1999. Both of these strains of flu began in regions of China and spread to other countries. Doctors are always on the lookout for the next major outbreak. They believe that if they can detect outbreaks quickly enough, they can keep them from becoming worldwide pandemics.
Influenza has been around for hundreds of years. Because flu viruses can change and develop into new strains, influenza may never be wiped out. When you have the flu, the most important thing you want to do is take care of yourself and prevent others from getting it. You’ll want to drink as much water as a camel drinks and sleep like a bear. Get a vaccine if one is available. Most importantly, remember to attack back! Good food and rest allow the healthy cells in your body a chance to win the battle.",1029.0
" His dream was that Americans would come together as one people without racism. He gave many speeches and spoke with many people about how to change the laws.
Dr. King wanted to use peaceful, or nonviolent, ways to make changes. He said there was already too much hate in the world to use violence to fight racism. Dr. King and his followers protested the unfair laws by refusing to follow them. For example, many black people held sit-ins, during which they sat at whites-only counters in restaurants. They refused to move, and some people, including Dr. King, were arrested.
Dr. King and his supporters marched with many people as another nonviolent way to protest racism and the segregation laws. They hoped to make people, especially lawmakers, realize that the unfair laws should be changed. After marching in Washington, D.C., Dr. King delivered his famous “I Have a Dream” speech at the Lincoln Memorial in 1963. He affected many people with his powerful words.
Because of the work of Dr. King and others, the government changed the segregation laws in 1964. The new laws are much fairer. It is now against the law to treat some people better than other people because of their race.
Black children and white children can go to the same schools. People can sit where they want on buses and trains, and in restaurants. The same water fountains and restrooms can be used by anyone, no matter their race.
Dr. King wanted all people to be free, and he wanted laws that treated everyone fairly. He dreamed that people of every race would get along.
We remember Dr. King when we visit the memorial in Washington, D.C. By honoring his dream of fair laws and free people, we carry on the work that Dr. King began.",951.0
" In the western United States, most national parks were created from public land. That’s land that belongs to the government—and, in a sense, to every American. For example, when the government decided to create its first national park—Yellowstone, in 1872—it already owned the land. By the early 1900s, the West already had a number of national parks. Acadia is the first national park east of the Mississippi River, though, and in the East, things were different. Settlers had been there longer. Much of the East was divided into little pieces and owned by separate people. The coast of Maine was no exception.
After Maine became a state in 1820, more and more people discovered the beauty of its rocky coastline. First, farmers and fishermen came, then painters. By the 1880s, rich people from big, Eastern cities began showing up, wanting to breathe fresh summer air. They bought up land and built fancy summer homes.
By the early 1900s, a few rich landowners had the idea of buying land in order to protect it. One of these was George Dorr. He and others began to donate their bits of land to create a park that would preserve the area’s beauty. By 1913 they had acquired 5,000 acres (20 sq km), which they gave to the government. Dorr continued to acquire property, and in 1919 all that land became a national park.
Acadia National Park is a place where sea and mountain meet. People come to see them meet, to breathe the salty air, and, of course, to watch the Sun rise. After greeting the new day, there is plenty more to see and do in Acadia. Visitors can hike, climb, fish, or ride a bicycle. If you ever get the chance to visit, do!",914.0
" For example, owl meant “observation plane.” The Navajo word for shark meant “destroyer,” a type of warship. A “submarine” was called an iron fish.
Navajo people were taught from an early age to listen to and learn the stories of their people. The Navajo soldiers had no problem learning the new code. When they took a test to see how well they could transmit radio messages, the military was amazed. The code talkers could do in seconds what other coders needed half an hour to do!
The military quickly started using the code and began training more code talkers. Many Navajo men were eager to serve. In total, more than four hundred Navajo code talkers served brilliantly in the Pacific. One of the biggest battles of the war was the Battle of Iwo Jima. During it, six code talkers sent and received more than eight hundred messages in the heat of combat without a single error. One of those six, Keith Little, said, “My weapon was my language, and that language probably saved countless lives.”
The Japanese could not make sense of the code. Even after Japan gave up on September 2, 1945, the code stayed secret. The code talkers could not talk about their work. They remained silent for They also returned to hard lives after the war. For many who had been soldiers, jobs were tough to find, and Native Americans often faced discrimination. Navajo and other tribes in Arizona and New Mexico could not vote until 1948. Tribes in Utah could not vote until 1957.
Finally, in 1968, the silence around the code talker program ended. Then the world learned about the amazing work of these men. To this day, the Navajo code is the only spoken military code that has never been broken.",894.0
" He built a new building and called it the New Hermitage. It would have been terrible not to have this beautiful collection on display for all to see. But three times in the Hermitage’s history disaster nearly destroyed everything.
My great-great-grandmother survived the first disaster in 1836. A big fire at the Winter Palace threatened the collection. Palace soldiers took precious items from the palace out onto the square as fast as they could. Nearly everything was saved. My grandmother told me stories of the second disaster in 1917. A revolution happened in Russia. Nicholas II and the royal family were thrown out of the palace. The new government moved the art collection to the capital city of Moscow. No one really knew what would happen to the art.
By October 1917, the ruling government lost its power. A second new government brought back the art and made the Winter Palace and New Hermitage a state museum. My mother survived the third disaster in 1941. German troops attacked, and Russia was drawn into the Second World War. Over a million works of art were saved from the battle. Two special trains filled with art were sent to a remote part of Russia in the Ural Mountains. The Germans cut off St. Petersburg (then called Leningrad) for 900 days. Hundreds of thousands of people, including Hermitage workers, died during the siege.
The Hermitage’s collection endured. It began as a small collection of paintings loved by one Russian empress. It survived several disasters. It has grown to become one of the oldest, largest, and most impressive collections of art enjoyed by the world. I live in the Hermitage as my great-grandmother’s grandmother did before me. Now you too can see why the Hermitage is the world’s greatest museum and place to live.",885.0
" President Barack Obama nominated the next female justice, Sonia Sotomayor, in 2009. Sonia’s parents came from Puerto Rico. Her father died when she was nine. Her mother worked hard so Sonia could get a good education. Sonia worked hard at school to get scholarships to go to college. After law school, Sonia worked as a lawyer and then a judge.
When President Obama nominated Sonia for the Supreme Court, he hoped that a majority of the 100 U.S. senators would confirm, or agree to, his choice for a justice. When a majority disagrees, the president has to choose someone else. Thirty-one senators voted against Sonia becoming a justice. Because sixty-eight senators voted “yes,” she became the first Latina and the third woman on the Court.
In 2010, President Obama nominated Elena Kagan to be the next justice. Elena had been a law clerk for the first African American justice to serve on the Court. In time, she became the top lawyer in the U.S. government for cases brought to the Supreme Court. She was the first woman in that role.
Some senators said Elena should not be on the Court because she had never been a judge. They voted against her. However, many of the 111 people who had served on the Supreme Court before Elena hadn’t been judges either. Plus, most senators agreed that Elena knew the law very well. After 63 senators voted “yes,” she became the fourth female justice in the Court’s history.
The four women of the Supreme Court come from different ethnic groups and backgrounds. They are Catholic, Jewish, and Protestant. Two have children and two do not. Some have worked as teachers, while others have worked as judges. They don’t always agree on the law, but they all agree that women, like men, can make wise decisions.",908.0
" People also use the pumpkin flesh to make tasty pies, breads, and soups. No part of the pumpkin need go to waste.
The next step is to draw a design on the pumpkin. When the design is finished, it’s time to carve. People can carve faces, animals, designs, or a message. They can also use stencils or even paint to decorate the pumpkin. Every jack-o’-lantern is a special creation. After the pumpkin is carved, a candle or other light can be placed inside and the pumpkin lid can go back on top. It’s best to display a jack-o’-lantern within a few days of carving. After a few days, the pumpkin may spoil and lose shape.
Many cities host jack-o’-lantern festivals to display their artistic pumpkins. Some of the pumpkins feature traditional scary faces. Creative carvers have also fashioned cartoon characters, animals, and other detailed designs. In Hudson Valley, New York, thousands of jack-o’-lanterns make up a special display. This festive event features sound effects and music. Hundreds of pumpkins lie side by side to form snakes, dinosaurs, and even a pumpkin planetarium.
A massive display in Los Angeles, California, showcases pumpkin cars, dinosaurs, and carvings of sports, television, and movie stars. People can watch as the artists carve their pumpkins into jack-o’-lanterns.
Recently, the town of Keene, New Hampshire, broke a world record for the most lit jack-o’-lanterns on display. The town boasted a whopping thirty thousand lit jack-o’-lanterns!
Carving pumpkins into jack-o’-lanterns is a fun activity for people of all ages. Pumpkins can be carved with a scary face or detailed artwork, or be used as part of a larger display. However people carve them, jack-o’-lanterns are a sure sign that Halloween is around the corner. Jack-o’-lantern designs are only limited by the carver’s imagination.

" He could not stay in the same hotels as the rest of the team. Other minor league teams refused to play because of Robinson. Opposing pitchers threw the ball at him. Even some of his teammates didn’t want to play with him.
None of this abuse stopped Robinson. He played well enough to move up to the Dodgers the next year. Wearing number 42, Jackie Robinson took the field on April 15, 1947, before a crowd of more than twenty-six thousand spectators. The Dodgers earned a victory that day, not only over the Boston Braves but also over prejudice against African Americans.
Robinson also went on to have a great career. He was chosen Rookie of the Year in 1947. In 1949, he was voted Most Valuable Player in the league. Robinson was a fast runner who led the league in stolen bases. He helped the Dodgers win six league championships and a World Series victory. In 1962, he became the first African American to enter the Baseball Hall of Fame.
After retiring from baseball in 1957, Robinson joined the coffee maker and fast-food chain Chock Full o’ Nuts. In doing so, he became the first black vice president of a U.S. national company. In 1964, he cofounded the Freedom National Bank, which grew to become one of the largest black-owned banks in the United States. Six years later, he launched a construction company. Robinson also became a civil rights leader who continued to work for equality for all people. He died in 1972 from heart problems and diabetes complications. Today in the United States, people of color have more opportunities in the world of sports than ever before. We all have Number 42 to thank for that.",929.0
" They saw the road with their parents. But now—it isn’t there.
Andria realizes why. When this arch was built, people couldn’t see the street, either—it was covered by centuries of dirt! Augustus Caesar had built the ancient street in 6. Almost a hundred years later, Titus built the arch on top of the dirt. Even back then, the Romans were building on and around their past. Andria feels a weight in her pocket. She pulls out a gold coin and waves it in triumph!
The girls walk through the Roman Forum and up Capitoline Hill. On their left, they see the ancient pillars and arches of Teatro Marcello. They both remember their guide telling them that new condominiums have been built above the old arches of the teatro. And they see that the church next door used pillars of an ancient building to make part of its outside wall. A third gold coin rolls in the street toward them!
Andria and Rosa found their three clues! Immediately, the past melts away, and once again they hear the honking of car horns. It’s today again—and the dancer is beside them. She leads them to the Pantheon. Andria points to the 15-foot slope next to the ancient temple and says “See, the street level of today is much higher than the street used to be.”
The girls now know that without the past, the new would have nothing to stand on. In many ways, the new depends on the old. After nodding to each other with pride, they see their parents waiting for them with open arms. The girls run to them, waving their coins and shouting, “Let’s get more gelato!”",801.0
" The cello Ma plays was made in 1733 and is worth $2.5 million. In 1999, he left it in a taxicab by accident. After the driver returned it, Ma recorded a message that played in every taxi in New York. It reminded people not to leave things behind at the end of their ride.
Chinese, French, and American ideas have all shaped Ma’s music. Although he started off playing European classical music, he soon branched out to other kinds of music. Ma has played bluegrass, Argentine tango, jazz, and traditional music from China, Japan, and Brazil. He has also played songs from Broadway musicals and movie soundtracks. He says that being open to new ideas is important to better understand both music and people.
In 1998, Ma decided he needed a musical group that reflected his mix of cultures. He founded the Silk Road Ensemble. The group is made up of musicians and composers from twenty countries. They work together to make music that draws from traditions all over the world. The Silk Road was a trade route that stretched across Asia hundreds of years ago. It helped spread ideas all around the continent.
“I’m an Accident”
Many musicians say their success came from hard work or natural talent. Yo-Yo Ma says he has no idea why he became one of the world’s most popular musicians. “I’m an accident,” he once said. He says his success comes from many things. His parents, teachers, sister, wife, and children have all helped him. Living in Paris and New York and performing at a young age all shaped him. If any of those things had been different, he feels that he might not have become a world-famous musician. If he hadn’t seen that giant double bass as a four-year-old, his whole life would have been different.",913.0
" It lives off the coast of Indonesia. Scientists discovered it because its coloration differs from that of other bamboo sharks. This new species is thought to reach about 30 inches (80 cm) in length. It uses its fins to push itself along the ocean floor in search of food. The wiggling movement makes it look as though the shark is walking.
In 2013, researchers discovered that for more than a hundred years, olinguitos (oh-lin-GEE-tohs) had been identified as the wrong species. These mammals, which look like teddy bears, leap through trees at night. The smallest member of the raccoon family, the olinguito can be found in Ecuador and Colombia. It is the first species of this type to be discovered in the Americas in thirty-five years.
Finding new species of birds is almost as rare as finding new mammals. In 2009, researchers discovered the Cambodian tailorbird near the city of Phnom Penh. Tests showed that this tailorbird was a separate, new species. Besides studying its DNA and feathers, scientists studied its pretty song. While all tailorbirds warble, no two species sound quite the same. Sure enough, the song of the Cambodian tailorbird sets it apart from all the rest.
What’s Next?
Scientists continue to amaze us by finding new species. Experts agree that most have yet to be discovered. However, those animals we have discovered bring some problems to light. For example, many species have tiny populations. Human activity causes many species to face small and shrinking habitats. Yet each new discovery is also cause for hope. It can bring a renewed effort to save and even restore a habitat. Doing this can save the animals that live there, both those we know about and those we don’t know about . . . yet.",906.0
" This is especially true in North America, where the holiday was not widely celebrated until the 1800s. Halloween was frowned upon by many of the first European settlers in the New World. That changed when many Irish settlers came to the United States in the 1800s. They brought their Halloween traditions with them, including jack-o’-lanterns and mumming. Slowly, more and more Americans celebrated Halloween. Sadly, as Halloween became more popular, pranks became common. By the 1930s, the pranks were a big problem. To make things better, some cities tried to change Halloween into a holiday for families. Many held trick-or-treating events for children. Trick-or-treaters in the 1930s and 1940s received cookies, fruit, toys, and coins.
Trick-or-treaters began to receive candy in the 1950s. However, the little Halloween candy bars common today didn’t appear until the 1970s. The treats have changed over the years, but kids have stayed excited about the holiday. In the United States alone, more than 41 million children went trick-or-treating in 2014.
Halloween is growing even more popular. Especially in the United States and Canada, more people celebrate Halloween every year. Some cities hold trick-or-treating events at malls, churches, or other places. These events help to keep trick-or-treaters safe from street traffic. The crowds aren’t made up of kids alone, though. Many adults celebrate Halloween, too. In 2015, people planned to spend more on costumes for adults than on costumes for children. Halloween is fun for kids—but adults definitely don’t want to be left out.
Halloween today looks very different from celebrations of the 1950s, the 1800s, and the Samhain festival of the ancient Celts. Its traditions keep changing, mixing the old with the new. Today, Halloween has traditions from several different cultures that people of all ages can enjoy.",934.0
" The next year, Yosemite became the third U.S. national park. In 1892, Muir helped found the Sierra Club to keep the Sierra Nevada protected, and he became its first president. The Sierra Club is now a leading conservation organization. In 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt asked to meet with Muir. The president wanted to better understand the needs of wilderness areas in the West. Honored, Muir took him on a camping trip into Yosemite. During the trip, Muir asked the president to set aside wilderness areas as protected parks. As a result of that trip, more areas of Yosemite became part of the national park. Roosevelt also set aside many other wilderness areas for protection.
In his later years, Muir spent more time writing about his travels. He also led a twelve- year fight to protect a valley in Yosemite from being flooded by a dam. Even with efforts to stop the project, including a letter Muir wrote to government members, it was approved in 1913. The fight raised awareness about the protection of wild places. It also helped lead to the creation of the National Park Service (NPS) in 1916. The NPS set up stronger protections for all U.S. national parks. John Muir died on December 24, 1914. Although he did not live to see the creation of the National Park Service, his efforts helped make it a reality.
John Muir was a founding father of the conservation movement. He was one of the first people to call for taking action to protect wild places. John Muir struggled for years to find his true path in life. Yet nature always called to him, inviting him to know it better. Over time, his purpose became clear. Muir’s contributions to conservation have earned him a place of honor in American history.",947.0
" “Yes,” Morty said, “I pulled some tomfoolery.” That was his new vocabulary word, and he thought he’d try using it. His mother kept staring at him, and he figured she wanted more of an explanation.
“I filled her shampoo bottle with garlic and stinky cheese vinegar. Her ears are stuck back that funny way because I put sugar water in her perfume.” Mother was still staring expectantly. “I did it because I was mad at her for hogging the bathroom. I am really, really sorry,” he added quietly. There wasn’t a squeak in the mouse minivan on the way home. As soon as they got in the house, Morty went to his room and put on his Mega Mouse pajamas. Then he counted his money. While waiting to brush his teeth—his sister was taking a long bath—Morty found Mother and asked her for help. “Will you help me go to the store tomorrow and get a few things? In exchange, I will scrub the bathroom twice a week for the next month.” Mother looked at Morty sternly. “Yes, Morty, I’ll go with you to the store. But I want you to take some time to think about what you’ve learned from this experience. Your sister’s reputation may not be quickly repaired. It can take a long time for others to forget.” Then Mother gently kissed Morty behind the ears.
The next afternoon, Morty’s sister entered the bathroom to a wonderful surprise. On the counter was a colorful bag with her name on it. Inside was new Fruity Tootie shampoo, Mouse of Mystery perfume, and three tubes of Miss Mouse Luscious Lips. Next to the bag was a beautiful bouquet of flowers and a note in Morty’s best cursive. Morty’s sister smiled as she read it.",716.0

The Twin Towers were a striking addition to the city’s skyline. For thirty years, the World Trade Center towers were the tallest buildings in New York. Then disaster struck. On the morning of September 11, 2001, hijackers flew two passenger jets into the towers. Within an hour after the attack, the South Tower began to fall and crumble to the ground. The North Tower soon followed. New Yorkers watched in disbelief as these enormous structures were reduced to heaps of burning rubble. Nearly three thousand people died as a result of the attack.
The World Trade Center tragedy was devastating. New Yorkers mourned the loss of their neighbors and their landmark. They vowed to rebuild the World Trade Center. Excavating the ruins of the old towers took time. Plans for the site took years to develop. There were many construction ideas and strong opinions about what should be built on the site. Finally, the Port Authority unveiled the design for the new World Trade Center complex. One area was set aside as a memorial park for those who had lost their lives that day. The sites of the original buildings are now pools with cascading waterfalls. A memorial museum contains items from the old towers.
Nearby, a new 104-story tower has been constructed. Nicknamed the Freedom Tower, the structure rises an astonishing 1,776 feet (541 m). The building’s height symbolizes the year of the United States’ independence. At the top is a lighted spire that is visible for miles. Several other high-rise buildings are being constructed at the site as well. By the year 2020, the new World Trade Center complex should be complete. New York’s ever-changing skyline will reflect the spirit of a city that continues to adapt and grow.",932.0
"5 mi.) wide. Officially, the two countries are still at war. Although they agreed to a cease-fire, they never agreed to peace.
Until the mid-twentieth century, South Korea was primarily a nation of farmers. As a result, many of its important holidays are linked to the moon calendar. New Year’s Day, called Seollal (SAHL-lahl), is the most important of these festivals. On this holiday, South Koreans celebrate everyone becoming one year older with food, gifts, games, and fortune-telling. A harvest festival called Chuseok is another important holiday. Families visit and clean their relatives’ graves and leave food offerings to show their respect. On a baby’s first birthday, the parents place objects in front of the baby and let the baby choose his or her favorite. If the baby picks up a book, he or she will be smart. Picking up money means the baby will be wealthy.
Korean food is often spicy. Kimchi, a food a little like spicy sauerkraut, and rice are served at nearly every meal. Fish, seafood, and pounded rice cakes, called tteok (DAWK), are also important parts of Korean meals. Some South Koreans have an old saying: “Food is the best medicine.” They believe that both health and sickness come from the food they eat. Another old belief is that some foods have mystical powers. For example, sweet red beans and rice porridge are supposed to chase off evil spirits and give long life.
Over the centuries, the people of South Korea have grown strong by working hard and showing respect for their families and for each other. This way of life has helped South Koreans win wars and stay strong during hard times. South Korea has become a modern world power—a country and people with a bright future.",927.0

Maui’s brothers paddled with all their might, for they were eager to see what he had caught. Finally they could hear something splashing up through the waves behind the canoe. One of Maui’s brothers looked back and screamed, horrified. He saw an enormous island rising behind them, caught on Maui’s magic fishing hook. It looked like a monstrous fish about to devour them all.
Maui gave one final heave and cast the line free, settling the island into place. Suddenly, the brothers found that they were paddling in shallow water next to a beach. Exhausted, they rested on their oars. Everyone looked up in wonder at the island that Maui had pulled out of the ocean. That is how the hero Maui lifted the Pacific Islands out of the sea.
Maui gave humankind many gifts, including the gift of summer, the gift of the islands, and the gift of the sky. But he was not able to give humans the gift of immortality. Maui believed that it was not right that people should die. He decided to steal the secret of immortality from Hine (HEE-nay), the goddess who kept the secret to immortal life in her heart. Maui knew that the only way to steal the secret was to steal Hine’s heart. Maui approached Hine while she was sleeping and dived into her open mouth. He found Hine’s heart and nearly escaped with it. But Hine woke just as he was trying to come out of her mouth again. She caught Maui in her teeth and killed him. Maui was not successful in giving humankind the gift of immortality, but humans remember him and honor him for the attempt. In this way, the hero Maui survives as the stories about him are passed down from generation to generation.",907.0
" This information was analyzed using the GNH Index. The higher the number, the greater the happiness level. The survey found that women, farmers, and people who were uneducated or elderly were the least happy. The government began to improve health care and daily life. Then another survey was done in 2015. Bhutan compared the results of the two surveys and learned that its citizens’ overall happiness grew by 1.8 percent. More than 43 percent of the population was considered very happy.
There were certain areas, though, that showed a decline. People did less volunteer work. Fewer people thought tradition was important. The Bhutanese government plans to use the information from the survey to increase happiness. They may, for example, hold festivals that ask for communities to join in ancient traditions. The goal is to have a 100 percent deeply happy population someday.
Other nations around the world have taken notice of Bhutan’s GNH Index. Some have made their own to track their citizens’ happiness. In 2007, Thailand created a national happiness index similar to Bhutan’s. South Korea and Great Britain also developed their own scales similar to Bhutan’s index. In 2009, a big company took a happiness survey of people in the United States.
In 2011, the United Nations, an organization of countries around the world, did a study of world happiness. The United Nations printed its first World Happiness Report in 2012. The report ranked countries based on ideas like those used in Bhutan’s GNH Index. That same year, the United Nations officially declared March 20 the International Day of Happiness. Why March 20? On that day, the Sun is lined up with Earth’s equator, and day and night are equally long. This day represents the Bhutanese king’s belief that balance is the key to national happiness.",919.0

Interviewer: Is there anything else you want to share with the people who will read this book?
Erik: I’ve learned from the mountains that you don’t have to be the fastest, or the smartest, or the most popular, or the person with the best eyesight to be a leader. You need some skill, but you also need a vision of who you are and what kind of person you want to be. Then you need a lot of courage to carry it through. Many adults try to lead through their intentions and words, but I think you lead best by your actions. Climbers call it “taking the sharp end of the rope,” which means actually getting out there and climbing. When I think about leadership, it’s about taking the sharp end—it shows in your decisions rather than in your words.
Interviewer: So in other words, people will follow you when you act rather than when you try to gather them up behind you by talking to them?
Erik: Yes. You need to gather a good team of people who believe in you, but what moves the world forward are people who are willing to step out and take the sharp end.

Antibiotics are a recent development in human history. Before the mid-1800s, some healers recognized that certain plant molds and other fungi attacked bacteria. In the 1800s, more research led to a better understanding of the link between microbes and disease. Then in the 1920s, Scottish biologist Alexander Fleming accidentally discovered a plant mold that destroyed a dangerous form of bacteria. Out of his research came the wonder drug penicillin, which is capable of killing many forms of bacterial infection. Fleming was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1945 for his breakthrough work.
In the mid-1300s, the mystery and horror of the Black Death terrified Europe. Many people who lived through the Black Death believed it was the end of the world. In terms of death rates, it remains the most destructive event in European history.
At the same time, some historians link the disaster to helpful changes that followed. From the late 1300s until the 1600s, Europe underwent big changes. This period, known as the Renaissance, was a time of great improvements in medicine, science, and art. Renaissance means “rebirth” in French. After the Black Death, a period of rebirth was exactly what Europe needed.
England went through a period of economic shock in the aftermath of the Black Plague. Farmers and laborers were in such great demand that they saw their wages rise up to 40 percent from the 1340s to the 1380s. This big social shift so alarmed the upper classes and nobility that royal officials passed a law attempting to fix wages for peasants at the levels they had been before the Black Death. They passed another law to prevent peasants from leaving their home villages in search of better jobs. These crackdowns led to a major uprising known as the Peasants’ Revolt in 1381.",1072.0

Phase three looks at how changes in air temperature, moisture levels and carbon dioxide influence these massive hill slopes.
John knows that breaking down rocks may seem pointless to some of us. “It’s really difficult for people to understand how these studies can be applied,” he said.
The scientists at B2 understand, though. Just as B2 once gave them data about life in a closed ecosystem, now it tells them what to expect about life on Earth as our climate continues to change.
“If we can anticipate,” John said, “then we can prepare, adapt, shift behavior. Hopefully, we could survive.”
The climate is always changing, so why are people worried about climate change now?
By burning fossil fuels, we create greenhouse gases—gases, such as carbon dioxide, that trap heat in our atmosphere. Many scientists now say that Earth is getting warmer and has been for many years. That heat may lead to more severe weather (from hurricanes to droughts) and poorer quality habitat for wildlife.
Changes in one place can lead to changes elsewhere. Earth’s air, water, and land are all linked to the climate; melting ice, for instance, leads to rising sea levels. Today, these changes are happening faster—and on a bigger scale—than anything modern humans have seen before.
As a ten-year-old, I still have plenty more to learn about science, but I understand why we do experiments. We want to discover things we don’t already know. After all, any experiment can teach us something. In the case of B2, we learned that no matter how much money we spend, we still don’t know how to engineer a long-term system that will give us everything we need in order to live. Yet Earth provides these services for free. We can’t take Earth for granted and survive.
In other words, B2 is great—but nothing beats B1.",964.0

I have held my own with justice, and no friend has lost his life through me. Though I am sick with deadly wounds, I have comfort in this. Now go quickly, beloved Wiglaf. Show me the ancient wealth that I have won for my people, the gold and brilliant gems, that I may then happily give up my life.”
Wiglaf quickly entered the dragon’s den at the bidding of his master. On every side, he saw gold and jewels and choice vases, helmets, and bracelets. Overhead hung a marvelous banner, all golden, gleaming with light. He filled his lap full of golden cups and platters, and also took the brilliant banner. He brought the treasures to Beowulf and laid them on the ground. “I thank God,” said the dying king, “that I have been permitted to win this treasure for my people; now they will have all that they need. But I cannot be any longer here. Tell my men to raise a tall mound on the headland overlooking the sea, and there place my ashes.

The Lion now walked to the Throne Room and knocked at the door. “Come in,” said Oz. “I have come for my courage,” announced the Lion, entering the room. “Very well,” answered the little man; “I will get it for you.”
He went to a cupboard and reaching up to a high shelf took down a square green bottle, the contents of which he poured into a green-gold dish, beautifully carved. Placing this before the Cowardly Lion, who sniffed at it as if he did not like it, the Wizard said: “Drink.”
“What is it?” asked the Lion. “Well,” answered Oz, “if it were inside of you, it would be courage. You know, of course, that courage is always inside one; so that this really cannot be called courage until you have swallowed it. Therefore I advise you to drink it as soon as possible.” The Lion hesitated no longer, but drank till the dish was empty. “How do you feel now?” asked Oz. “Full of courage,” replied the Lion, who went joyfully back to his friends to tell them of his good fortune. Oz, left to himself, smiled to think of his success in giving the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman and the Lion exactly what they thought they wanted. “How can I help being a humbug,” he said, “when all these people make me do things that everybody knows can’t be done?

After the first explosion, the real attack began. Bullets and rocket-propelled grenades struck the shields in dazzling blue light. As the main force focused its fire on the south side of the tower, a small team of five from the backup force flanked the north side. Though they all carried weapons, they didn’t fire. Instead, they snuck up to the tower. Then, one by one, with a flash of blue light, they passed through the shield and onto the grounds. “We can get in there!” Charlotte gasped. Before Sam could reply, she sprinted across the open area, keeping close to the ground, heading toward the point where the soldiers had passed through the shield.

Marley’s face. It was not in impenetrable shadow as the other objects in the yard were, but had a dismal light about it, like a bad lobster in a dark cellar. It was not angry or ferocious, but looked at Scrooge as Marley used to look: with ghostly spectacles turned up on its ghostly forehead. The hair was curiously stirred, as if by breath or hot air; and, though the eyes were wide open, they were perfectly motionless. That, and its livid colour, made it horrible. But its horror seemed to be in spite of the face and beyond its control, rather than a part of its own expression.As Scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon , it was a knocker again.To say that he was not startled would be untrue.

They had watched those worlds decline from the sidelines, sometimes for very long periods of time, until their ultimate demise. She didn’t know whether that was worse. The emotions passed through the link lingered, like echoes of memories, combining frustration and helplessness, and bringing it all to boil.

"” He nodded confidently. “Oh, shucks!” said the youth. “You ain’t the bravest man in the world, are you?” “No, I ain’t,” exclaimed the loud soldier indignantly; “and I didn’t say I was the bravest man in the world, neither. I said I was going to do my share of fighting—that’s what I said. And I am, too. Who are you, anyhow? You talk as if you thought you was Napoleon Bonaparte.” He glared at the youth for a moment, and then strode away. The youth called in a savage voice after his comrade: “Well, you needn’t git mad about it!” But the other continued on his way and made no reply.
He felt alone in space when his injured comrade had disappeared. His failure to discover any mite of resemblance in their viewpoints made him more miserable than before. No one seemed to be wrestling with such a terrific personal problem. He was a mental outcast. He went slowly to his tent and stretched himself on a blanket by the side of the snoring tall soldier. In the darkness he saw visions of a thousand-tongued fear that would babble at his back and cause him to flee, while others were going coolly about their country’s business. He admitted that he would not be able to cope with this monster. He felt that every nerve in his body would be an ear to hear the voices, while other men would remain stolid and deaf. And as he sweated with the pain of these thoughts, he could hear low, serene sentences. “I’ll bid five.” “Make it six.” “Seven.” “Seven goes.” He stared at the red, shivering reflection of a fire on the white wall of his tent until, exhausted and ill from the monotony of his suffering, he fell asleep.",737.0

Images from space show changes to land areas. For example, they show deforestation, or the loss of forests. They also show erosion, the wearing away of land by wind or water. Deforestation is a world problem. Trees help keep our air clean and are home to wildlife. Photos from space show large forest areas that have been cut down or burned.
Deforestation is also a cause of land erosion. That is because tree roots help to hold soil in place. Serious erosion has happened in Madagascar, an island nation near Africa. Entire forests have been cut down for fuel and new farmland. Photos show large amounts of soil being washed away and lost.
Scientists say our use of fossil fuels creates most of the changes in Earth’s climate. When we burn oil, coal, and natural gas we create harmful gas in the air. This type of gas traps more heat than usual above Earth. Images from space show us the effects of Earth becoming warmer. For example, they show where ice is melting or breaking apart.
Another result of Earth becoming warmer is the spread of deserts and other dry lands. Satellite images show where land is too dry to grow food or feed farm animals.
For most of history, people could see and understand just a small part of the world. They viewed everything at eye level. Even a person who traveled, or a scientist, could only see what was right in front of him or her.
Today, with cameras orbiting in space, we can easily watch and track large areas of Earth. These images of Earth can tell us about its changing condition. They help us understand how changes happening far away might affect us. What we do with that knowledge may decide the future health of our planet.",868.0
" These bands also have fiddles, which are violins played in a very different style than they are in an orchestra.
Cultures around the world have instruments that are very different from the ones described so far in this book. But most instruments, no matter where they are found, are played in one of four ways—by blowing, scraping, plucking, or hammering. Some examples of each type of instrument are shown on the following pages.
Blown instruments, including the woodwinds, all force air down a tube. Look at these photographs of blown instruments from around the world.
Scraped instruments include the violin family. They often use a bow that creates sound when scraped over strings. But many scraped instruments create music in other ways. These are two unusual scraped instruments.
Plucked instruments have strings that can be plucked using fingers or a variety of other objects. Here are some plucked instruments from around the world.
Hammered instruments include drums and other percussion instruments. They create music by hitting one object with another. Cultures around the world have many kinds of hammered instruments. Here are a few of them.
In many ways, the human voice can be considered a musical instrument. It is perhaps the most flexible musical instrument of all. It can create and sing songs with words, tunes without words, and a wide variety of rhythms and sounds. It doesn’t cost anything since no extra equipment is needed. If you are in a place where you need to be quiet, you can still hum or sing silently to yourself.
Music brings great joy to life. It helps us to express ourselves, and it fills our world with beauty. Whether you sing, dance, play an instrument, or sit and listen to music, be sure to make it a part of your life.",915.0
" These services are even more reasons to adopt your pet from a shelter.
Sometimes, puppies for sale at pet stores or breeders come from puppy mills. A puppy mill is a breeding business that does not take good care of its animals. Animals from a pet store or breeder can also be expensive, sometimes costing thousands of dollars.
The final reason to get a pet from a shelter is also the most important one. Every time someone adopts a pet from a shelter, an animal’s life is saved. Animal shelters have a limited amount of space and money to take care of their animals. When shelters become overcrowded, even healthy, tame pets are given a shot that painlessly ends their lives. If more people adopted from shelters, fewer pets would be “put to sleep.”
When you adopt from a shelter, you are likely to get a pet that is healthy and happy. With help from an adoption counselor at a shelter, you can find a wonderful best friend. Adopting a shelter pet saves one of the millions of homeless animals in the country. Shelter pets are definitely best.
About seventy-five million dogs and eighty-eight million cats live in American homes. Every year, as many as eight million cats and dogs end up living at shelters. About half are adopted. The other half are put to sleep. There are as many as six thousand animal shelters in the United States. To reduce the number of homeless pets, it is important for them not to have babies. By doing a simple, safe operation, your veterinarian can make sure that your pet will not have babies. You may not like the thought of your pet having an operation. and friendlier afterward. So be sure to have your pet “fixed.”",889.0
" This discovery completely changed medicine.
The early compound microscope also led to the discovery that no two snowflakes are alike. Wilson Bentley was known as “Snowflake” Bentley for his work with snowflakes. He used a camera to take pictures with his microscope. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, he took photographs of more than five thousand snowflakes. Microscopes showed that some things in nature form special shapes called crystals. Salt crystals are cubes, like building blocks. Table sugar forms crystals that are slanted at each end and longer than salt crystals.
Seeing the world’s tiny details can help people understand how things work. Take burrs, for example. A man named George de Mestral saw that burrs stuck to his clothing after he walked in a field. He took a closer look at the burrs under a microscope. He saw that they had tiny hooks that caught on the loops in the fabric of his pants. De Mestral worked to copy the design of the burrs using fabric. The result was Velcro. Velcro is made up of two pieces of fabric. One piece is covered in thousands of tiny hooks. The other is covered in thousands of tiny loops. The hooks and loops let the two pieces of fabric “zip” together.
Magnified One Million Times (1,000,000x)
Because of the way light works, there is a limit to how much a compound microscope can magnify objects. During the past century, though, scientists have created microscopes that don’t use light. One such microscope uses energy called electrons. Electron microscopes provide the greatest magnification of any type of microscope. They magnify things up to one million times (1,000,000x)!
As microscopes have become more powerful, we have learned many new things about our world. Microscopes have led to discoveries in nearly every area of science.",786.0

Ocean currents also play a part in climate. Cold water currents flow from the poles toward the equator. Warm water currents do the opposite, flowing from the equator toward the poles. Air above these currents slowly becomes the same temperature as the water. Consequently, if a prevailing wind blows from water to land, it generally warms or cools those regions. With its high latitude, Western Europe should have a fairly cold climate. However, a warm water current, the North Atlantic Drift, warms the air above it, giving Western Europe a milder climate. This current also gives the region a wet climate. Because warm air can carry more moisture than cool air, the air that floats over Europe is loaded with water vapor. People in this rainy part of the world need raincoats and umbrellas.
Most climates along the equator are hot all year round because of the direct sunlight they receive. Climates in other places on Earth change with the seasons because of Earth’s tilt. Look at the diagram above. In January, the Northern Hemisphere is tilted away from the Sun, which causes winter there. In July, it is tilted toward the Sun, which causes summer. The Southern Hemisphere has reversed seasons because it tilts in the opposite direction from the Northern Hemisphere.
You’ve just had a quick tour of the forces that affect Earth’s climates. Pick a place on a globe. Think about the factors that affect its climate. How far is it from the equator? Is its elevation high or low? Are there mountains or large bodies of water nearby? What season is it there right now? If you can answer these questions, you can probably guess what the weather is like there, even without leaving your home!",923.0
" In the United States, over twenty million people play each year. Programs exist for young people to learn the game and compete. Top men’s golfers compete in the U.S.-based Professional Golfers’ Association (PGA) Tour and the European Tour as well as several others. Top women’s golfers from around the world compete in the U.S.-based Ladies Professional Golf Association (LPGA) Tour. In addition, men and women each have several top professional tournaments, called majors. Winning a major earns a golfer respect, fame, and money. Only a small number of golfers earn a living by competing in golf tournaments.
Jack Nicklaus is the top golfer in the history of the sport. He competed in important tournaments from 1961 to 2005 and won more than a hundred competitions. He won eighteen majors. Patty Berg was the top woman to ever play golf. As a professional, she competed from 1940 to 1962 and won sixty tournaments and fifteen majors. Tiger Woods may be the greatest golfer playing today. He has done better on the PGA Tour than any other golfer now playing.
Golf courses are located in many different places. Some are like large, grassy parks with tall trees. Some are narrow strips of land along coastlines. In desert areas, courses often have cactuses and palm trees. The most unusual place golf has been played is... the Moon! Astronaut Alan Shepard went to the Moon in 1971 and hit a few golf balls while he was there. Few players will ever experience golfing on the Moon, but anyone who is interested can find a way to play golf right here on Earth. All you need is a club and a golf ball. With lots of practice, young players will learn what millions of golfers already know: golf is out of this world!",948.0

In overtime of Game 4 of the 1970 Stanley Cup finals, the Boston Bruins were trying to beat the St. Louis Blues 4-0. Bruins captain Bobby Orr was in front of the St. Louis net when another player passed him the puck. Just as Orr shot the puck past the goalie, another player tripped him. He flew through the air like a superhero. Many people believe that photo is the most famous one in hockey history.
Many strange things have happened at hockey games, and the Story of the Octopus is the strangest. It began in Detroit in 1952. To win the Cup, a team had to win two best-of- seven series (eight games in total). During one game, two Detroit fans threw the body of a dead octopus onto the ice—eight legs for eight needed wins. Detroit ended up winning that year, and the octopus was seen as good luck. In one 1995 game, fans threw thirty-six of the animals onto the ice.
The Edmonton Oilers were an All-Star Team in the 1980s. Led by Wayne Gretzky (GRET-ski), they won five Stanley Cups in seven years. Gretzky was so good that Boston coach Terry O’Reilly said, “He’s the best. There should be a league rule that he has to be passed around from team to team every year.” Gretzky wasn’t the only Oilers star, however. Six other Oilers players from that time also became members of the Hockey Hall of Fame.
Every year, hockey fans dream of their favorite team winning the Stanley Cup. For more than a century, players have skated, scored, and saved for the chance to drink from this great prize. You never know what will happen in the Stanley Cup playoffs. No matter which team wins, the true winners are hockey fans around the world.",921.0
" The country mouse was surprised at how busy and crowded the city was. He had never seen so many other mice living in one place. The city mouse decided to show his country cousin around his fancy home. Everything was of the finest quality, including the delicious foods stored on the kitchen pantry shelves. “Look at all this food!” exclaimed the astonished country mouse. “You must eat very well.” “Well, yes,” whispered the city mouse as he looked around nervously. “But you must lower your voice. There is a cat that guards the pantry, and she is always on the prowl for mice.”
The country mouse decided he’d had his fill of city life. He much preferred the quiet aloneness of country life to the crowded, dangerous city. He thanked his cousin for the visit and returned to his humble home. Moral: It is better to live simply in safety than to live in luxury and fear.
A hungry wolf wanted some dinner, so he disguised himself as a sheep and visited a nearby pasture where a flock of sheep were grazing peacefully. The shepherd tending the sheep was fooled by the wolf’s costume. He opened the pasture gate and herded the wolf inside. The sneaky wolf soon found an unsuspecting lamb to eat, but by then the shepherd had realized what was happening. He rescued the lamb from the wolf in just the nick of time. Waving his staff, the shepherd chased the wolf from the pasture and warned him never to return. From that day on, no creature passed through the gate until the shepherd had carefully inspected it to make sure it was a real sheep.

" Sometimes when animals have babies, some of the babies are born with slightly different features. The difference may give this new animal an advantage toward survival. For example, it may be faster or have a color or pattern to better blend with its surroundings. With such an advantage, this animal is more likely to survive to produce its own babies. These babies are likely to also have the same trait and will be more likely to survive.
An animal whose camouflage does not work well will be eaten by a predator. Only animals with the best traits survive to produce offspring. Those offspring tend to have the same traits as their parents. In this way, the successful camouflage is passed on from one generation to the next. This process works for predators as well. Predators with the best traits will be the ones that have regular meals, stay strong, and are more likely to survive and reproduce. Their traits then get passed on to their offspring, who in turn are also more likely to survive and reproduce. Over thousands of years, weak and less protected animals failed to survive. This has allowed animals with the best traits for survival to live on and reproduce.
Only a few animals have no need for camouflage. These animals may have no natural enemies and eat plant food that cannot escape. The only threat to these animals comes from humans. Land animals such as elephants, rhinoceroses, and hippopotamuses do not need to camouflage themselves from natural enemies. In the ocean, only certain huge whales that eat plankton have no need of camouflage. For other animals, camouflage plays an important role in the struggle to stay alive.",936.0
" World War II began in 1939, interrupting the process. When Gandhi and the INC demanded that the British leave India in 1942, they were all arrested. Violent protests took place all over India. In 1945, the war ended. British and Indian leaders began to discuss the British leaving India. Throughout India’s history, Hindus and Muslims had often been in conflict. Gandhi believed that the people of these two religions could learn to live in peace in a united India. The Muslim League, which represented the Islamic people, wanted its own country.
When the agreement that ended British rule was signed in 1947, the country was split, against Gandhi’s advice. The Muslim people formed the new country of Pakistan. More than ten million people moved from one country to the other. There was much fighting, and many people died. Gandhi worked tirelessly. Through discussion and various nonviolent protests, he achieved a number of temporary peace agreements. No one else was able to do this at the time.
On January 30, 1948, Gandhi was on his way to a prayer meeting. He went to the ceremony with his granddaughter and grandniece. They helped the aging man walk and climb up onto the stage. About five hundred people were gathered to hear Gandhi’s prayers. A young Hindu man in the crowd opposed Gandhi’s work to make peace with Muslims. He came up to the stage, pulled out a gun, and shot Gandhi three times. Gandhi’s death saddened people everywhere. Nearly a half million people were at his funeral. Despite his death, the influence of this small man, whom Indians called Mahatma, or “Great Soul,” continued to change the world. His efforts inspired such great leaders as Martin Luther King Jr. and Nelson Mandela, and will continue to inspire people for many years to come.",882.0

Just as Egyptian scribes were important to the pharaoh, Mayan scribes were important to tribal kings. Scribes wrote text used in religious ceremonies. They used porcupine quill brushes to write glyphs in deerskin books. Mayan writing was often used to record a king’s victories in battle. Monuments and temples had glyphs carved into their stone walls and obelisks. The messages were a kind of propaganda written to tell about a ruler’s successes. The displays were a way for rulers to show power.
It was up to the scribes to post these messages in public. This was easy and safe for scribes of a victorious king. It was not as easy for scribes who were on the losing side of battle. Conquerors believed that the best way to win the war of words was to deny their enemy the chance to use them. Captured scribes from the losing side often had their hands hurt to keep them from ever writing again. Amazing examples of Mayan glyphs can be seen at sites throughout the Yucatan Peninsula. Ruins at Palenque, Teotihuacan, and Tikal bear the markings of ancient scribes.
The beautiful picture languages of the ancient Maya and the Egyptians are no longer used. Many other ancient picture languages, however, are still used today. Asian languages, such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, feature thousands of pictographic symbols. Modern picture languages exist as well. Simple block glyphs appear on signs for international travel. These symbols direct travelers from all parts of the world where to get their bags or catch a bus. It’s much easier to use glyphs than to make signs in many languages. Now, as in the past, a single picture sometimes works just as well as a dozen words!",961.0
" The buildings I’ve seen are all just glass and steel.”
“That’s true,” Dimitri agreed. “But you have to remember, this was not just an ordinary building. This was a temple to the goddess Athena, who protected Athens. All of these buildings of the Acropolis were meant to celebrate the greatness of Athens.”
“It sure is different today,” Brady answered, marveling at the monument before him and comparing it to the churches and office buildings back home.
After admiring the Parthenon and the other buildings, Brady found himself at a wall on the very edge of the hilltop. Below him, in every direction, stretched the crowded streets and rooftops of Athens.
In the distance, he could see the large oval of the Olympic stadium, and, even farther away, the sea.
As the Sun turned orange and began to drop below the horizon, Brady’s thoughts wandered back over all he’d seen.
“You know, Dimitri,” Brady said, while focusing on the orange-and-purple sunset spilling out before him, “You are right. I need to pay more attention to the details of life around me. I would have missed so many of these amazing sights if I had been by myself. Thank you for opening my eyes.”
“You don’t need to thank me, my friend,” Dimitri answered, putting a hand on Brady’s shoulder and joining him in admiring the sunset. “Nothing in life pleases me more than seeing friends truly appreciate the wonders of life around them. You have made me very happy today.” He stood silently for a moment, then continued: “And I think your father will be very proud of how you’ve learned to love Athens, just as he did many years ago.”

“You have one more day before I take the child,” the little man said, then evaporated.
By the third day, Evaline began to lose hope, and she sat by her son’s cradle, murmuring wordlessly. Just before evening, a flutter near the window drew her eye.
It was a swallow with blue and rust plumage, like the one from the tower years ago. It hopped about on the sill, chittering softly. When Evaline leaned close, she gasped. The swallow was speaking!
“I flew over the mountains, where I saw a little man, in a little hollow, by a little fire. He danced and sang this little song: ‘Evaline’s child I’ll surely win, unless she guesses Rumpelstiltskin!’”
Before Evaline could thank the swallow, it flew off into the gathering dusk. A tingle charged the air, and the gnome appeared by the baby’s cradle, grinning greedily.
“Tonight is your last chance,” he hissed, already reaching for the sleeping baby.
Through the open window, Evaline heard the swallow’s song. She drew herself up and declared, “Your name is... Rumpelstiltskin!”
A greenish rage flashed over the gnome’s face, and he let out a horrible screech that set the baby wailing. “You cheated! Someone told you! It’s not fair!”
“You made the deal,” Evaline said, lifting her son from the cradle.
“You’re a liar, a cheat, a thief!” Rumpelstiltskin screamed.

" A blanket of sadness covered them both. They shut down the computer and held their stones tight.
When their mother returned, they told her the legend of the Apache Tears, taking turns, without talking over each other. Mrs. Yates was touched to see how the story had affected her children.
“Can you see the tear of an Apache woman?” Paco asked her as he held his stone up to the light and looked at it.
Mrs. Yates took the stone and held it up to the light. “I think I do see it,” she said. “It’s a tear for the man she lost, and it’s a tear for the sad children he left behind.” She gave the stone back to Paco, closed his fingers over it, and squeezed his hand lightly. “It’s a tear that says ‘I wish my children were happy.’”
Paco and Tala gave each other a long look. They understood that their arguing was only adding to their mother’s grief over their father’s death. They understood that their father was not coming back and that they needed to find a way to live in harmony as a family again.
That night, after talking it over, Paco and Tala gave their stones to their mother. At first, Mrs. Yates did not want to take them because the stones seemed to have made her children friends again. Finally, Paco and Tala convinced her that they wanted her to have the Apache Tears, so Mrs. Yates slept with the stones under her pillow that night, and the next day she went to a jeweler and had them made into a necklace. When the necklace was ready, she slipped it on and never took it off again. Apache Tears really had brought them all good luck!",891.0

“Just in time,” Grandpa said, rising stiffly from the chair and rubbing his belly. Karen sprang from Dad’s lap and raced down the hall, her bare feet slapping on the wood floors. The kitchen door slammed against the wall as she burst in. “Karen, don’t run in the house,” I heard Mom scolding.

“We need to reach more people,” said Elias. “Wait a second! I just saw something the other day that might work for us; it was an app you can use to raise money for a cause online. We can set a funding goal, and people can contribute whatever they want from their phones or computers.” Ms. King agreed to the idea, and for the rest of that week, Elias and Ada worked with her to set up their fund-raising campaign online. They labored especially hard on the wording of their funding appeal, trying to make their rhetoric as persuasive as possible. On Friday, they posted the fund-raiser, and Ms. King personally shared it on the school’s social media pages.

Alice—Alice—I won’t forget it again. And now, which of these finger-posts ought I to follow, I wonder?” It was not a very difficult question to answer, as there was only one road through the wood, and the two finger-posts both pointed along it. “I’ll settle it,” Alice said to herself, “when the road divides and they point different ways.” But this did not seem likely to happen. She went on and on, a long way, but wherever the road divided there were sure to be two finger-posts pointing the same way, one marked “TO TWEEDLEDUM’S HOUSE” and the other “TO THE HOUSE OF TWEEDLEDEE.” “I do believe,” said Alice at last, “that they live in the same house! I wonder I never thought of that before—But I can’t stay there long. I’ll just call and say, ‘How d’you do?’ and ask them the way out of the wood.

Right on his head as usual! However, he gets on again pretty easily—that comes of having so many things hung round the horse—” So she went on talking to herself, as she watched the horse walking leisurely along the road, and the Knight tumbling off, first on one side and then on the other.

The guns squatted in a row like savage chiefs. They argued with abrupt violence. It was a grim pow-wow. Their busy servants ran hither and thither. A small procession of wounded men were going drearily toward the rear. It was a flow of blood from the torn body of the brigade. To the right and to the left were the dark lines of other troops. Far in front he thought he could see lighter masses protruding in points from the forest. They were suggestive of unnumbered thousands. Once he saw a tiny battery go dashing along the line of the horizon. The tiny riders were beating the tiny horses. From a sloping hill came the sound of cheerings and clashes. Smoke welled slowly through the leaves. Batteries were speaking with thunderous oratorical effort. Here and there were flags, the red in the stripes dominating. They splashed bits of warm color upon the dark lines of troops. The youth felt the old thrill at the sight of the emblems. They were like beautiful birds strangely undaunted in a storm.
As he listened to the din from the hillside, to a deep pulsating thunder that came from afar to the left, and to the lesser clamors which came from many directions, it occurred to him that they were fighting, too, over there, and over there, and over there. Heretofore he had supposed that all the battle was directly under his nose. As he gazed around him the youth felt a flash of astonishment at the blue, pure sky and the sun gleamings on the trees and fields. It was surprising that Nature had gone tranquilly on with her golden process in the midst of so much devilment.",947.0

Coral reefs are very fragile. Many things can harm them. People are the biggest cause of harm. People burn huge amounts of coal, oil, and gas to power cars and factories and to heat and cool buildings. Burning coal, oil, and gas is making Earth’s air and water warmer. Warmer ocean water causes many problems for coral reefs.
Corals are getting sick. Coral diseases can destroy a big reef in just weeks. Warmer water is also causing corals to lose their algae. Without algae, corals have no food. They also lose their color and turn white. Three-fourths of all coral reefs have this problem.
Other things harm coral reefs, too. Some people use poisons and explosives when they fish. Boats can break off large pieces of reefs. Dirt and trash can smother them. Boats can also leak gas and oil. Gas and oil hurt coral, plants, and fish.
Coral reefs are beautiful. They are also important for many reasons. Reefs help protect coasts from storms and floods. They provide food for many kinds of fish that people eat. Some reef plants and animals are used for medicines. Many countries try to protect their reefs. They have written laws and rules to keep reefs safe. But people do not always follow those laws and rules.
Half of the world’s reefs have been destroyed. Most of the others are in trouble. Scientists are working to help coral reefs. Each of us can help, too, even if we don’t live near an ocean. Never throw things in the water. Learn about what people do that makes ocean water too warm. We can all help protect coral reefs. Then all the living things on coral reefs will continue to have homes and food.",568.0

These illustrations show some of the most common figures you can see on totem poles.
In the past, a clan would hire a master carver to make a totem pole. Today, many museums, businesses, and people around the world also want totem poles created for them. First, they hire a carver and work with him or her to plan the pole. The carver finds a tree with no knots or bends. The carver cuts down the tree, cuts off the branches, and hauls it to the workshop. Then the carver chips away the soft outer wood.
Often, a team of carvers works on the totem pole. The master carver draws the designs on the log with charcoal. The master carver works on the bottom figure of the pole because this figure is the biggest and most important, and everyone can see it up close. Helpers carve and paint other figures on the totem pole. Carving a big pole can take as long as nine months.
When the pole is ready, it is brought to the place where it will stand. A potlatch is held to celebrate the raising of the pole. There is feasting, dancing, singing, and gift giving, and the totem pole’s stories are told. Prayers and blessings may be said for the pole and for the people who own it.
When European explorers came to the coast of Alaska and Canada in the 1800s, they were impressed by the many totem poles they found. Many of the poles were taken away and ended up in museums. In 1990, the U.S. passed a law that said native peoples would be able to get back property that had been taken from them. Because of this law, many totem poles are returning to their original homes and to the people who created them.",957.0
" Then, they decorate the outer part of the circle with shells. If a female likes the circle, she lays her eggs in the middle.
These sly spiders dig an underground tunnel, then make a trapdoor in the tunnel to catch prey. They cover the trapdoor with their silk, and cover that with dirt. When they hear prey passing above them, they open the door and the prey falls through. The door also protects the spiders from animals that hunt them.
Millions of ants work together to build underground ant cities. These giant cities have dirt “highways” and main paths that connect rooms. Side roads lead to gardens and trash pits. Tunnels allow air to flow. These tiny ants lift many times their own weight to build their huge cities.
Paper wasps gather bits of wood and plants. They chew them into a pulp, then spit out the pulp to make a soft nest. The nest is made up of cells that look like an egg carton. Wasp eggs develop in the cells. As the wasps grow in number, the nest gets bigger.
In order to reach water, some crayfish burrow into moist soil, pushing up wet dirt. The raised soil looks like a small chimney. Since the center of the chimney is empty, other animals, such as snakes, sometimes hide there.
If you are “busy as a beaver,” you are very busy. Beavers are master builders. They gather sticks and mud to build their dams. The dams create ponds. Beavers build their homes, called dens, on the ponds. The ponds protect beavers from predators. They also make it easier for beavers to store food during the winter.
Animals build great things. They do not need tools to build. They use their bodies, natural skills, and the Earth’s resources to build their structures. Animals are amazing!",639.0
" People collect the ants and remove their wings. Some fry the ants, while others dip them in chocolate. The people say queen ants have a minty taste.
In Mexico, some people enjoy French-fried caterpillars or ant eggs covered in butter. For dessert, chocolate-covered locusts or candy-covered worms are sweet treats.
Some Australians munch on witchetty grubs, which look like large white caterpillars. These insects have crisp skin and a smooth filling that tastes like almonds.
Some restaurants in Japan serve fried silk moth cocoons. Fried grasshoppers and other insects are sold in some stores.
Be Careful!
It’s very important to remember the following: Never eat wild insects! Walking into your backyard for a buggy snack can be dangerous. Insects that live outside can be covered with stuff that might harm you if you eat it. Also, some kinds of insects are poisonous and can make you very sick.
People who cook and eat insects should be careful to buy them from farms. Farmed insects have special diets. Also, farmers make sure the insects are not exposed to things that might harm people. In the United States, the best way to find edible insects is on the Internet. People can find live insects, meals made with insects, and tasty insect recipes.
Let’s Start Cooking!
David George Gordon, a chef from Seattle, Washington, wrote the Eat-A-Bug Cookbook. People like his pasta with six-legged meatballs, which are made with crickets. Other favorites are fried tarantula and white chocolate and waxworm cookies. Gordon believes that eating insects is a better way to get protein than eating chicken, cows, or pigs. Insects are cheap and easy to farm in plain fish tanks. They do not harm the environment. For these reasons, insects may be the food of the future. Can you “swallow” the idea?",894.0
" A skillful hunter, it feeds on many kinds of animals, even skunks and snakes. In Florida, one great horned owl tackled a 6-foot (2 m) indigo snake and won. It also eats birds, including eight other owl species. In fact, many large owls eat small owls.
While most owls hunt only at night, snowy owls hunt mostly during the day. That’s because summer nights in the Arctic are so short. The tiny elf owl hunts during the day as well, feeding mostly on insects. The main diet for most owls, though, is small mammals—lots of them. A hungry great gray owl may eat 1,400 voles in a year. In its lifetime, a barn owl may eat 11,000 mice!
Some owls can live in many different habitats. The great horned owl lives in swamps, forests, prairies, mountains, and deserts. Barn owls live under bridges as well as in caves, empty houses, church towers—and barns, of course!
Some owls require a special habitat, though. Burrowing owls live mostly on the prairie and nest underground, using old burrows dug by mammals. When open spaces are hard to find, they move to cemeteries and golf courses, and even near airport runways.
Spotted owls can only survive in old-growth forests. By 1994, 80 percent of their former habitat had been destroyed by logging. To protect the spotted owl, loggers cut down fewer trees, but barred owls have since taken over spotted owl habitat. Today, they outnumber spotted owls in the northwestern United States.
It’s rare to see an owl, but they’re out there. If you’re in the country and want to spot one, try going out at dawn or dusk. Listen for their calls. If you stay out late enough, people might think you’re an owl—a night owl, that is.",908.0
" The trainers take the dogs back and forth to the island for an entire breeding season before leaving them on their own.
During breeding season, the trained dogs stay on a wooden deck that has shade, food, and water. From the deck, they watch over the penguins. Eudy and Tula are the sixth and seventh Maremmas given the job of protecting penguins. Two dogs stay on the island during every breeding season. Phil Root is the main dog handler. He cares for the dogs when they are off duty.
“It is an honor to work with the volunteers in the project to protect our Middle Island penguins,” Root says. “It is a great responsibility to care for the Maremmas that are truly loved by the Warrnambool community. People stop for photos and to talk about how proud they are of this wonderful project.”
These trusty pups need a break now and then. Eudy and Tula are taken to the mainland a couple of days a week to rest because the weather conditions on the island are harsh. After breeding season, they stay with a family on a farm.
About two hundred volunteers give their time and money to keep the penguins safe. During breeding season, volunteers count the penguins arriving on the island each night during the penguin parade. They also check burrows, looking for penguins and chicks. “The chicks are recorded and monitored for weight gain and feather development,” says Abbott. Other volunteers take care of the island and educate visitors about the project.
Making the planet a better place for animals takes hard work, lots of support, and sometimes the brilliant idea of one person. The Middle Island Maremma Project is a great example of how communities can come together to make a difference in the lives of animals.",989.0
" Color blindness can even limit a person’s career choices. Some jobs, such as airline pilot, require full-color vision. Others, such as photographer, are much more difficult without full-color vision.
Doctors use several types of tests to find out if a person has color blindness. One test uses images made up of dots that are different sizes and colors. People with full-color vision can see numbers or shapes inside the pictures. People with red-green color blindness have trouble spotting the hidden symbols.
So far, doctors can’t cure color blindness. However, many new tools can help people deal with color blindness. Smartphone apps can do tasks such as identifying colors and picking colors that go together well. These apps can help people choose matching clothes or tell which fruits are ripe at the grocery store. Researchers have also created high-tech sunglasses that filter out specific wavelengths of light. The sunglasses make it possible for people with red-green color blindness to tell the two colors apart.
Scientists recently corrected red-green color blindness in squirrel monkeys. The monkeys lacked red cone cells. As a result, they couldn’t tell the difference between red and green. Researchers were able to insert the missing gene into cells in the monkeys’ eyes. Within about twenty weeks, the monkeys could tell the difference between red and green dots. These successful experiments in squirrel monkeys provide hope for a cure in humans.
Color Vision for All?
Researchers gain a better understanding of color blindness all the time. Every year, new tools are developed to make life easier for people who are color-blind. Best of all, a treatment for color blindness may be available in the near future. Who knows? Maybe someday soon, color blindness will be a thing of the past!",956.0

Another problem, known as bleaching, also results from ocean water getting too warm. When this happens, the algae in coral polyps change in a way that harms the polyps. To stay safe, the polyps get rid of the algae. Since the algae are their main source of food, they begin to starve. They also lose their color, which makes them look bleached.
Corals can sometimes recover from bleaching. But if the cause of bleaching continues, both the corals and the reef will die. Bleaching now affects three-fourths of coral reefs. Because of human activities, Earth’s oceans also contain too much carbon dioxide. The extra carbon dioxide makes ocean water more acidic. As a result, corals can’t take in a certain chemical that keeps their skeletons healthy. Without it, their skeletons dissolve. People are harming coral reefs in other ways, too. Fishing methods that use poisons and explosives have destroyed over half the reefs in the Philippines. Building along coasts causes soil erosion and pollution. Another danger is breaking off chunks of coral reefs by accident or on purpose.
Many countries have taken steps to protect nearby reefs. In some places, it is against the law to take fish, plants, or coral. People and boats are not allowed near many fragile reefs. But these laws are only a start.
Half of the world’s coral reefs have been destroyed. Most of those that remain are in trouble. Scientists are working to help coral reefs. We can help, too. Even if we don’t live near an ocean, we can do our part to reduce global warming. Using less energy, recycling, and walking or biking more all help. With our help, coral reefs will still be a beautiful natural wonder many years from now. What can you do to help?",855.0
" This battle became one of the most famous events of Ramses II’s rule. It holds the record as the world’s largest chariot battle. Ramses claimed that he faced the enemy alone. The battle was reported as a clear Egyptian victory. From looking at Hittite records, though, scholars think the battle was a draw.
Ramses thought the Hittite army was still many miles north, so he divided his forces to capture Kadesh. One group went ahead of him as scouts. Another group followed a day behind. A third group circled around to attack from the far side. When Ramses learned that the Hittite army was much closer than he thought, he sent for help. The Hittite army then attacked Ramses’s men.
As Ramses reported, he held off the enemy by himself while the rest of his army fled. Other records say that part of Ramses’s army arrived just in time to save the king. Both sides suffered heavy losses. The two kings stopped fighting, and Ramses and his army went home. Over the following year, Ramses ordered many wall carvings of the battle. All of them showed him as a hero. Fifteen years later, the two nations were about to go to war again. This time, though, Ramses decided against another war so far to the north. Ramses II and the Hittite king agreed to make peace.
Ramses II died of natural causes at the age of ninety-one. His thirteenth son became king. However, the dynasty was nearly over. One hundred fifty years after Ramses’s death, the New Kingdom came to an end.Today, Ramses II is known as Ramses the Great. We know more about the people of his time thanks to the art, buildings, and records he left behind.",771.0
" She also took people for rides in her plane. She gave many black people their first chance to fly. Bessie took other steps to help put an end to discrimination. She insisted that everyone, blacks and whites, males and females, should be allowed to attend any of the events in which she participated. She would not give a show or a speech to a white-only crowd.
At first, Bessie had to borrow a plane for her shows. In time, Bessie had enough money to buy her own plane, a Curtiss Jenny. Shortly after she bought the plane, its engine jammed, and she crashed. Bessie had a broken leg, broken ribs, and numerous cuts. She was in the hospital for three months. As soon as she was released, Bessie went right back to flying.
In April of 1926, Bessie agreed to do a show in Jacksonville, Florida that included a parachute jump. She and her mechanic, William Wills, took the plane up to pick out a spot for the parachute jump. Bessie didn’t wear her seat belt because she needed to lean out of the plane to spot a good place for the jump. The plane suddenly went into a spin. Bessie fell out of the plane and was killed. The airplane crashed, and William Wills was killed, too. It was a sad day. The country had lost a true aviation pioneer and one of its favorite pilots.
After her death, the U.S. Post Office issued a stamp in her honor and a Chicago street was named after her. May 2 has been declared Bessie Coleman Day in Chicago. Three years after Bessie’s death, one of her most important dreams was fulfilled. The Bessie Coleman Aero Club was opened in Chicago. It was the first flight school for African-Americans.",819.0
" Most of these belong to a group called marine algae. They are also known as seaweed. There are many different types of seaweed, but only some of them are found in tide pools. Seaweed provides good hiding places for animals. It also provides a substrate to which some animals attach themselves or their eggs.
Tide pools are fun to explore. They are like an aquarium full of sea creatures. If you ever go to the ocean, find a place where there are tide pools. The best places to find tide pools are rocky shores. Pay attention to the rising and falling of the tides. Usually newspapers near the oceans publish the times and heights of the tides. Remember, the lower the tide, the more you are likely to see. When you find a tide pool to explore, there are some things you can do to help you see more creatures. It is best to move slowly and gently to avoid stepping on or crushing animals.
Sometimes it is a good idea to just stop and closely observe one small area that you find interesting. The longer you look, the more likely you are to see things. Remember that the tide pool is home to many creatures. If you lift up a rock to look for creatures, do so gently. Always put rocks back where you found them. Check with an adult if you want to pick up a tide pool animal—some of them can sting! Put some water in your hand first to keep the animal moist. And always put sea creatures back where you found them. Animals need to stay in their tide pool homes. They don’t make good pets and are likely to die if they are removed from the tide pool.",694.0
"141592653. Whew! In 2009, the U.S. Congress voted to make March 14 National Pi Day. One representative who voted for it said he hoped students would “discover that they really do like math and they really do like science.”
How Do People Celebrate Pi Day?
The first Pi Day was celebrated in 1988. An American scientist named Larry Shaw arranged for a huge celebration at the San Francisco Exploratorium. People marched around a circular room, sang songs, and ate pie. News stories about the celebration spread the idea to schools, museums, and communities. Eventually, Pi Day events were held all over the world. Many people celebrate Pi Day with family and friends. The most popular way to celebrate is by eating pi-themed foods. Many people make pizzas (round ones, of course) and bake fruit or cream pies. Some people even use a special pie pan shaped like the Greek letter π. Those who are willing to go one step further drink pi-neapple juice, too. If all that food is too sweet, there are always dinner foods such as shepherd’s pie and chicken potpie.
After all that eating, some people work off their food by walking or running a pi marathon. These runs have distances of 3.14 miles (5.05 km) or 3.14 kilometers (1.95 mi.). Walking or running in a circle is also an option. Other people celebrate by decorating their rooms or themselves with pi-themed objects. They cut out the shape of π and put it on walls and tables. Some people wear T-shirts with π on them or π-shaped jewelry. Mathematicians celebrate the number pi because it is useful and important for many mathematical and scientific projects. The rest of us can celebrate Pi Day, too. It helps us remember that science can be fun as well as useful.",908.0
" They get their name because they move across the desert sand using the sidewinder motion. Sidewinders are smaller than diamondbacks, usually less than 1 meter (3 ft) long. Smaller rattlesnakes include the banded rock and pygmy rattlers. How do you think these snakes got their names?
Other than when hunting, rattlers only bite in self-defense. Most people get bitten when they bother the snake or accidentally step on it. Often, a threatened rattler gives a “dry” bite with no venom. And even if the snake does inject venom, it usually injects a small amount. Rattlers aren’t trying to kill people or animals that threaten them. They only want to hurt the person or animal enough so that he or she will go away and keep away in the future.
There are far fewer rattlers around today than when Columbus landed in the Americas. Because many people fear rattlers and do not understand the good they do, they often needlessly kill them. Not long ago, rattlesnake roundups were popular. During these hunts, people captured all the snakes they could find. The snakes were killed and skinned. The meat was sold and the skins were made into belts, wallets, and purses.
Other things threaten the survival of rattlesnakes. Rattlesnakes like to sun themselves on warm roads. Cars and trucks kill many of these snakes. People also destroy rattlesnake habitats as they build larger cities and more highways. Some people are beginning to take action to help rattlesnakes survive. Many rattlesnake roundups have been banned or limited. Signs alert drivers to roads where rattlesnakes may be sunning themselves. Snake habitats have been set aside and protected. If we respect these animals, they will not hurt us. And as we learn more about rattlesnakes, we understand why it is important to protect them.",900.0

Barack ran for the United States Senate in 2004. He was asked to speak at an important meeting of the Democratic Party. He gave a hopeful speech about all Americans working together to help the United States become an even greater country. The speech was a big success, and Barack’s words inspired many people. He easily won a seat in the U.S. Senate later that year. Because of the speech, many people encouraged Barack to run for president—the biggest job in the United States—in 2008.
Barack had to be convinced that being president was the best thing for him and his family. He thought that he did not have enough experience as a U.S. senator. Barack knew that, because he was African American, running for president could be dangerous. He knew that just running for president would change his and his family’s lives forever. He could no longer take a walk or get his hair cut without drawing a crowd. While he thought about whether or not to run for president, Barack’s reputation grew.

" Slavery is one of those monsters of darkness to whom the light of truth is death.” One of his most famous speeches was “What to the Slave Is the Fourth of July?” In it, Douglass surprised his audience by asking questions about what Independence Day meant for slaves and former slaves. “What have I, or those I represent, to do with your national independence? Are the great principles of political freedom and of natural justice... extended to us?”
By the Civil War, Douglass was the most famous black man in the United States. In 1863, he served as President Lincoln’s advisor on the Emancipation Proclamation, an order that freed most of the slaves. Some historians think Douglass helped inspire Lincoln’s famous Gettysburg Address. Douglass also convinced Lincoln to allow black soldiers to fight for the North. When they did, two of Douglass’s sons were among them.
Douglass’s writing and speaking helped end slavery with the Thirteenth Amendment, passed after the Civil War ended in 1865. Three years later, the Fourteenth Amendment gave citizenship to former slaves. In 1870, the Fifteenth Amendment gave every male citizen, even former slaves, the right to vote.
Douglass wanted the United States to truly become a “land of the free” for blacks, women, Native Americans, and immigrants, too. “I would unite with anybody to do right and with nobody to do wrong,” Douglass said. He continued to fight for equality for the rest of his life. Douglass died on February 20, 1895. Today, Douglass is often called the father of the civil rights movement. He changed the way the country thought about slavery and race. He left behind words to continue to inspire Americans, including this motto: “Right is of no sex, truth is of no color.”",981.0
" Galileo was not the first person to come up with this idea. However, his discoveries were the best proof yet that Earth was not the center of our solar system.
Galileo published writings about his discoveries that angered the Church. During the Renaissance, the Church had the power to punish people for unacceptable beliefs. Galileo had dared to insist that the Church was wrong, and in 1633 the Church put him on trial. At the trial, he was found guilty and threatened with death. Galileo was forced to say that his earlier discoveries had been lies, even though they were accurate. For the rest of his life, he was not allowed to leave his home. He was also forbidden to publish.
Galileo continued to write about his discoveries, however. He even managed to publish, despite the Church ordering him not to. He published Two New Sciences in 1638. It was his final publication. At that point, Galileo had become blind. Galileo’s health continued to fail. He died in 1642 of natural causes.
We now know that Galileo was right: Earth moves around the Sun. Galileo’s gift for asking important questions helped him make some of the greatest discoveries of his time. Scientists are still following many of Galileo’s ideas. For example, he was the first to say that laws of nature could be described using math. He was also one of the first scientists to insist on using measurable data in his experiments. By doing so, he made it easier for other scientists to test his ideas. Galileo set an important example for many scientists who followed him, including Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein. Today, we call him the father of modern science.",879.0

Emeralds are another kind of crystal and are known for their strong green color. Gem- quality emeralds are rare and usually small, but people prize their color so much that emeralds are more valuable than diamonds. Jade is one of the most beautiful stones. Jade can be lavender, white, and almost every shade of green, which is the most valuable.

" Using all of her massive weight, she pressed down on the saber-toothed tiger, and instantly he, too, was dead. Blood dripping down her side from the wounds on her back, she turned to see if there were more. But there was nothing there, except for a small, frightened mammoth calf.
Time was running out. Urging Woolly to follow, she hurried back down the snow-packed trail to the narrow ice bridge across the crevasse. She started across, with Woolly following. The snow bridge, weakened by the herd that had gone before, began to crumble. Chunks of snow and ice broke away as the bridge slowly collapsed. Woolly stopped at the last possible moment, stepping back onto the solid ice of the glacier.
With a gasp, he watched as his mother fell from the bridge into the seemingly bottomless chasm. His heart pounded, and large tears formed and froze in the corners of his eyes. His mother was gone! Worse than worse, he was trapped on the glacier, and the herd was on the other side, fading from view. He trumpeted a long, lonely tone that echoed down into the chasm. And then, there was only silence. Woolly’s call did not go unheard. For in an ice-cave not far away, a young saber-toothed tiger first heard the blood call of his parents, and then, last, the haunting farewell from the young calf.
Now, the ending of this story is up to you. What happens next to these two young creatures trapped in isolation on the blue-ice glacier? What do they do for food? What does Woolly do for shelter? Does the hunter become the hunted? Just how will it end? The author would like to know what you think and why.",782.0

With Route 66’s popularity came traffic—lots of it. Heavy traffic caused the highway to deteriorate. From 1956 through the 1980s, new interstates—high-speed highways with many lanes—were built around Route 66. As more travelers took interstates, businesses on Route 66 suffered, and many closed. Peeling paint, faded signs, and boarded-up windows became common sights. In 1999, the United States Congress passed a law to protect Route 66.

" States such as Nevada and Arizona rely on the shrinking Colorado River, a source of freshwater for 22 million people. If rains don’t increase soon, odds are good that desert residents will be forced to use less water in their daily lives.
Scientists say climate change is also melting glaciers high in the Himalayan Mountains. The glaciers help provide freshwater for 1.5 billion people living in India, Pakistan, and six other Asian countries. In the past, the melting glaciers slowly released water into the rivers below. Now the glaciers are melting rapidly, and the long-term water supply is shrinking. At the same time, the increased melting has caused severe flooding along these rivers. As the climate changes, less water is available in many countries for ranching, growing crops, and producing energy. Nature and wildlife suffer. Arguments break out between cities, states, and even countries.
So what can we do? Each person’s efforts to save water can help. Countries need to find solutions, too. Workers in Saudi Arabia are converting salt water to freshwater in a process called desalination. The process is expensive, though, and many countries cannot afford to build desalination plants.
The island of Singapore is seeing if they can clean their wastewater. They’re trying to reuse water that comes from washing dishes, flushing toilets, and taking baths and showers. Some other countries do this, too, but Singapore obtains one-third of its water this way. While cities are growing rapidly, agriculture uses about 70 percent of the world’s freshwater.

In 2013, researchers discovered that for more than a hundred years, the olinguito had been wrongly identified. This mammal, which looks a lot like a teddy bear, leaps through trees at night. The smallest member of the raccoon family, the olinguito can be found in Ecuador and Colombia. It is the first species of this type to be discovered in the Americas in thirty-five years.
Finding new species of birds is almost as rare as finding new mammals. Finding one in a major city is rarer still. Yet in 2009, researchers discovered the Cambodian tailorbird in and around Phnom Penh—including in the middle of a road construction site. A detailed set of tests revealed that this tailorbird was a separate, new species. Besides studying its genes and feathers, scientists studied its pretty song. While all tailorbirds warble, no two species sound quite the same. Sure enough, the song of the Cambodian tailorbird sets it apart from all the rest.
What’s Next?
Scientists continue to amaze us by finding new species. Estimates of just how many animal species fill our planet vary widely. However, experts agree that most have yet to be discovered. Those animals we have discovered highlight some challenges. For instance, many species have tiny populations. Human activity causes many species to face small and shrinking habitats. Yet each new discovery is also cause for hope. It can spark a renewed effort to save and even restore a habitat. That, in turn, can save the rare and surprising animals that live there, both those we know about and those we don’t know about... yet.",935.0
" Most plants start as seeds. A plant’s life cycle begins when a seed sprouts, or germinates. Roots push down into the soil in search of water and nutrients, while leaves reach out for sunshine. Plants turn light energy from the Sun into chemical energy that powers their growth, a process called photosynthesis.
Mature giant sequoia trees are the largest plants on Earth. An individual sequoia tree can grow more than 90 meters (295 ft.) tall. It starts as a tiny seed, though, about the size of an oatmeal flake. After sprouting, a giant sequoia is called a seedling. After a few years, it starts to resemble an adult tree and is known as a sapling. It may take twenty years for a giant sequoia to reach 12 meters (39 ft.) in height.
Young giant sequoias may start producing cones at about the age of twenty. Both male and female cones grow on the same tree. Powderlike pollen from male cones lands on female cones and fertilizes them. Fertilized female cones then begin to form seeds. The average giant sequoia seed cone contains 230 seeds. A mature giant sequoia may produce more than 300,000 seeds a year. Less than 1 percent of sequoia seeds ever have a chance to germinate, though. Conditions must be perfect, with proper amounts of moisture and sunlight. Giant sequoias are among the longest-living life-forms on Earth. Their life cycle may last more than three thousand years.
Nothing lives forever—not mayflies, not elephants, not giant sequoias. All living things complete their life cycle when they die. In nature, when a living thing dies, its body decays and breaks down. It releases nutrients and chemicals that other organisms use to live, grow, and reproduce. Even when they die, living things help cycles of life continue.",896.0
"” Isabel threw her hands over her face with embarrassment, but Andrew just started to chuckle. Then the chuckle turned into a very loud, long laugh.
“Well, you’re honest, aren’t you? Let me go get my mom and dad. They’re probably wondering who I’m talking to. Then we can tell you all about the big mystery.” Mr. and Mrs. Bradford appeared a moment later. After introductions, the Bradfords explained the reason for their family’s odd behavior. “Andrew has a condition called XP. The XP stands for Xeroderma Pigmentosum (ZE-ro-DER-ma PIG-men-TOH-sum). His skin and eyes just can’t tolerate light from the sun. He gets sunburned almost immediately, and it takes a long time to heal. Other than that, he is just like you in every way. As much as we’d love to live lives like yours, it’s pretty tough to do without sunlight,” Mr. Bradford said. “Andrew’s playtime is limited to moonlight only, so we’ve adjusted our lives to his. It makes finding friends in a new place a bit of a challenge, I’m afraid,” Mrs. Bradford added. Isabel and Nico tried not to stare. This was a lot to swallow all at once, but suddenly, Isabel’s face lit up.
“Hey, Andrew, since it’s dark now, would you like to meet some more of the neighbors? There’s this really cool tree house, and we play kickball, and...” Isabel babbled excitedly while Andrew’s parents nodded with approval. She and Nico led Andrew toward his new friends. The annual Halloween block party was never better. Under a full moon, the neighborhood celebrated the night with its newest members. Isabel came as a fairy princess, and Nico was a wise old wizard. Grady and Jessica Peterson were pirates. And, to everyone’s surprise, Andrew Bradford came as the most convincing vampire anyone had ever seen.",811.0
" Birds make their nests in seaside cliffs. But the most famous Antarctic resident is the penguin. Emperor penguins are the only creatures that can withstand the Antarctic winter on land. Penguins have thick, waterproof feathers and a layer of fat called blubber to keep them warm.
Emperor penguins are the largest penguins. Early in the winter, the female emperor penguin lays a single egg. She gives it to the male, who balances it on the tops of his feet. Then, the female penguin leaves for the ocean to eat fish. The male carefully holds the precious egg for the entire winter. Emperor penguins have a flap of feathered skin that they use to cover the egg and keep it warm. Males huddle close together to keep warm during fierce Antarctic blizzards. They do not eat or drink anything for months. Finally, spring arrives. The eggs hatch, and the females return. Then the males and females bring food to the chicks until the chicks are ready to fish for themselves.
The polar regions are some of the last areas of wilderness in the world, but they are being threatened. Oil companies build wells and pipelines in the Arctic. Tourists visit Antarctica to see the wildlife. Sometimes, humans leave behind garbage and pollution that harm the environment. The Earth is also warming up. Permafrost all over the Arctic is melting, sometimes causing the ground to collapse, taking buildings and roads with it. Ice caps break up and melt much more often than they used to. No one knows what this warming will do to polar animals. Most nations of the world have agreed to try to protect polar regions. Hopefully, the only threat that polar life will have to face in the future is the cold.",811.0
" This outer layer is the compact bone. Below the compact bone is the spongy bone, which has holes to keep the bones light so our muscles can lift them. Inside the spongy bone is bone marrow. Bone marrow is the place where the body makes blood cells. The bone marrow in a typical adult produces more than 50 billion red blood cells every day!
Even though bones are very strong, they can break if they are hit hard enough. Healing a broken bone requires a little help from a doctor and a great deal of help from bone cells. For a bone to heal correctly, the bone must be put back the way it was before the break. Doctors may need to move around the broken bones to put them back together. Then they place a cast around the body part where the bone was broken. The cast keeps the body part from moving so the bone has time to heal. As soon as a bone breaks, bone cells begin repairing it. Holding the broken bone in place with a cast allows the bone cells to do their job.
Bones need to stay healthy to remain strong. Exercising regularly is the best way to keep your bones in good working order. Eating a well-balanced diet helps the bone marrow to produce healthy blood cells. Legumes (such as pinto beans or peas), other vegetables, and fruits are good for your bones. Foods rich in calcium, such as dairy products and fortified soy milk, rice milk, and orange juice, can also help bones to grow. Your bones give your body its shape, and they also give you much more. They give you the ability to move, sit, stand, and write. You wouldn’t be you without your bones!",864.0
"
The frond is strong, and the momentum of my running actually whips me around to the side. I peek down and see no ground, just a sea of clouds far below turned gray by the moonlight. I land hard and roll into a sapling as the creature swings itself out of the forest and realizes too late that it has nothing else to grasp.
In the moonlight, I finally see it: a dark, hulking creature resembling an octopus the size of a small car, with a bulbous head and more horrible-looking tentacles than I can count in the few moments it hangs in view. Wood creaks as the last tentacles try to hold onto the trees, but the creature’s bulk is too great. It’s tentacles flail, trying to grasp anything. One latches onto my pant leg. I wrap my arms around the sapling, hanging on with everything I have.
With loud cracking sounds, the trees the creature is holding give way. For a moment, I think it will take me over the cliff with it, but I feel the fabric of my pants tear in one sudden jerk.The thing falls silently. I crawl to the edge of the cliff in time to see it disappear into a puff of clouds.
I lean back, sitting on my heels, trying to catch my ragged breath. My hands shake, and I feel as if I might cry. I’d never been so frightened in all my life.Before me stretches a sea of gray clouds, disappearing into the darkness beyond. Behind me, the forest waits silently. More of those octopus creatures could be lurking beneath the ground, or perhaps worse things are waiting for me.Two things become clear in this moment: I’m alone, and this isn’t the Hollow.Where am I—and where are Sarah and Jake?",964.0
" Now that life on Rocky Ridge Farm was comfortable, could Laura do the same?
Laura began to pour her memories onto the page. Sometimes she would stay up all night writing at a little desk that Manly built for her. Soon, she had written an entire book about her early years under the towering trees of Wisconsin. She called it Little House in the Big Woods. Rose sent it to a publisher. Sixty-four-year-old Laura didn’t think much would come of it. After all, it was the 1930s. People had cars, electricity, radio—who wanted to hear about doing backbreaking chores in a dark forest? The book was an immediate hit. Laura brought to life the howling winter wind, the crackling fire, and the joyful skip of Pa’s fiddle. She captured the thrill of meeting animals in the wilderness. She called up the joy that a simple rag doll could bring to a pioneer girl who lived in a rough log cabin. The mailbox at Rocky Ridge overflowed with letters from young readers begging for more. Laura wrote about her time on the Kansas prairie in Little House on the Prairie and near Walnut Grove in On the Banks of Plum Creek. The frightful winter in De Smet became The Long Winter, and the town’s recovery became Little Town on the Prairie.
Laura loved answering letters from her fans and traveling to readings and book signings. Yet she was always happy to return home to Manly and Rocky Ridge Farm. The couple both lived into their nineties. After her death in 1957, Laura Ingalls Wilder’s books lived on, even becoming a TV series in 1974. Her stories of pioneer life still delight young readers today. Her life has become part of American history.",913.0
" When they discovered that she had last been seen leaving Asgard with Loki, they commanded him to bring Idun back to Asgard. Loki knew that Thiassi’s lair was deep in the mountains. Unable to reach it on foot, he borrowed a magical cloak of hawk feathers from Freyja, the queen of the goddesses. Transformed into a hawk, he flew to the mountains and found Idun alone in the giant’s house. Thinking quickly, he turned Idun into a nut and flew away, clutching her in his talons. When the giant returned home, he was enraged to discover Idun gone. He transformed back into an eagle and pursued Loki in his flight. As Loki drew near Asgard, the other gods saw him flying desperately, with the eagle close behind. They stacked up logs and kindling around the outer walls. As Loki flew, exhausted, into the palace, the gods lit the fire. The eagle couldn’t stop himself. He flew directly into the wall of flames and was killed. So the gods of Asgard regained their youth and defeated the giant.
The Nordic peoples told many stories that illustrated the wisdom of Odin, the trickery of Loki, and the might of Thor. Many stories from Norse mythology, like those told here, are tales of conflict between the gods and the giants. The giants represented the forces of darkness and winter. The gods battled them constantly to restore light, warmth, and growth. Eventually, the gods faced the giants in a great battle. At its end, the gods were defeated and the cosmos (including the giants) was destroyed—but was reborn thereafter. Some of the gods survived and returned to remake the human race. Norse mythology treats life as a cycle: death and destruction are opportunities to begin anew.",945.0

Sarah asks where they are going, but Thomas says they should trust the tunnel to take them where they need to be.Jake seems oblivious to the dangers or strangeness, which is good, Sarah thinks. Only occasionally does he ask her if she thinks Odie is okay. He even asks Thomas if he knows where the dog is, but Thomas doesn’t know.The ducks are incessant. What started out as adorable quacking has become the most obnoxious sound ever.Sometimes, Sarah looks behind them and thinks she can see the writhing of the creatures following, but they never come into the light.

" The clay envelope had to be broken in order to get to the message inside. This kept anyone but the receiver from reading it.
A central government carried out laws and regulations. Trade grew and expanded. Business deals used cylinder seals—carved tubes that were pressed into clay. Pressing one’s seal into the clay was like signing one’s name today.
The Mesopotamians also developed the idea of numerical place value. The way we measure time uses this same system from long ago.
Around 3500, the Sumerians began using a round flat mechanical device to make clay bowls. The potter’s wheel sat horizontally on an axis and, when spun, allowed the potter to make a bowl with even edges and surfaces. It took a while for the Sumerians to use it to easily move objects and transport people. After much experimenting, the Sumerians tried attaching one wheel to each side of a single axle. The result made it easy to carry loads. The cart rolled across the ground with minimal effort. Other civilizations copied the Sumerians’ invention, and wheels were soon used across the world.
The Akkadian Empire ended in about 2150 after many revolts and an invasion by the Gutians (GOO-tee-uhnz). The Gutians came from the mountains to the north and held regular raids on the outer parts of the kingdom. This made it unsafe for Akkadians to travel or work in the fields. In time, the Gutian nomads took over Akkad, and the Akkadian Empire collapsed.
The Gutians let the canals fall apart and brought on a terrible famine. Their 125-year rule of Sumer led to what came to be known as the Dark Age of Mesopotamia. It was not until the seventeenth century that Mesopotamia would return as a thriving empire called Babylonia.",941.0
"”
Uncle Jasper’s face drops, and he begins to pace around the small room, repeatedly rubbing his hands through his hair. “They were being held by the creatures, and I witnessed their escape through a tunnel the girl, Sarah, must have conjured. I assumed they had escaped danger, so I continued on my path to the palace and arrived just in time to see Sarah and Jake follow the cat right through the front doors.”
Seth gasps dramatically and covers his mouth with his tentacles. “So that’s why the solid ground is spreading.”
“I don’t understand,” I say.
“The Queen is quite old, and over time, the effort of sustaining this solid world has taxed her will and imagination to the point where she can’t maintain her creations on her own anymore. She uses another, feeding on his or her will and imagination, twisting it to her own desires and capturing the other person into a world of illusion. The Queen used me for some time, and when I managed to escape, she captured another, Anna, and has been using her ever since...” His voice trails off, and the anguish is evident on his face.
“For a long time, the solidity was static. When the solidity started spreading again, I had to find out why. I believe the Queen was reaching out to lure in someone whose imagination and will was more powerful than Anna’s—and who has more imagination and will than children?”
“Sarah and Jake,” I whisper, and Uncle Jasper nods.
“We don’t have long now. We have to rescue them before they succumb to the Queen’s illusions completely and are lost to us, like Anna.”

"” “But Sergeant Rotten Teeth is dangerous to our teeth,” Ashley said. “Part of our book review process is to hear different perspectives about the books in question. If you object to them, Ashley, we’d like to hear why.” “Gladly,” Ashley said. “And Miguel here can say why he thinks the books should stay in the library,” she added. Under his breath, Miguel muttered something in disgust. It sounded like dental hygiene.
That Friday’s Whitmore Weekly was dedicated to the controversy over the potential book ban. I had coeditor Ashley write a column in support of the ban and coeditor Miguel write one in opposition. I ran Dan Eaton’s email. I ran an interview with Mrs. McGuinness detailing the book review committee process and how students could share their thoughts on what should happen with the books. And I wrote an intro to the entire package that included a quote from another former president, Lyndon B. Johnson: “Books and ideas are the most effective weapon against intolerance and ignorance.” Before school let out, Mrs. McGuinness told me she wanted a student representative on the committee—namely, me. “There’s one catch,” she said apologetically. “You’ll need to read all twelve books.” “Ten down, two to go,” I said.
Six weeks later, a shorter follow-up story appeared. Miguel or Ashley really should’ve written it, under the circumstances, but Miguel has lost interest in the series, and Ashley was just too mad about the way the vote turned out. I went on to include lots of quotes from people on the board and student reactions, but the story opened with the news itself.

I want to see how it looks on it.” Instead of obeying, Jim tumbled down on the couch and put his hands under the back of his head and smiled. “Dell,” said he, “let’s put our Christmas presents away and keep ’em a while. They’re too nice to use just at present. I sold the watch to get the money to buy your combs. And now suppose you put the chops on.”
The magi, as you know, were wise men—wonderfully wise men—who brought gifts to the Babe in the manger. They invented the art of giving Christmas presents. Being wise, their gifts were no doubt wise ones, possibly bearing the privilege of exchange in case of duplication.

" I have held my own with justice, and no friend has lost his life through me. Though I am sick with deadly wounds, I have comfort in this. Now go quickly, beloved Wiglaf. Show me the ancient wealth that I have won for my people, the gold and brilliant gems that I may then contentedly give up my life.”
Quickly did Wiglaf enter the barrow at the bidding of his master. On every side, he saw gold and jewels and choice vases, helmets, and bracelets. Overhead hung a marvelous banner, all golden, gleaming with light. He filled his lap full of golden cups and platters, and also took the brilliant banner. He hastened to return with his spoils, wondering, with pain, if he should find his king still alive. Wiglaf bore his treasures to him and laid them on the ground. “I thank God,” said the dying king, “that I have been permitted to win this treasure for my people; now they will have all that they need. But I cannot be any longer here. Bid my men make a lofty mound on the headland overlooking the sea, and there place my ashes. In times to come, men shall call it Beowulf’s Barrow, and it shall tower aloft to guide sailors over the stormy seas.” The brave king took from his neck his golden collar, took his helmet and his coronet, and gave them to his true thane, Wiglaf. “Fate has swept all my kinsmen away,” said he, “and now I must follow them.” That was his last word as his soul departed from his bosom to join the company of the just.",952.0
" How is absolutely a mystery. That completes the remarkable story of Davidson’s eyes. It’s perhaps the best authenticated case in existence of real vision at a distance. Explanation there is none forthcoming, except what Professor Wade has thrown out. But his explanation invokes the Fourth Dimension, and a dissertation on theoretical kinds of space. To talk of there being “a kink in space” seems mere nonsense to me; it may be because I am no mathematician. When I said that nothing would alter the fact that the place is eight thousand miles away, he answered that two points might be a yard away on a sheet of paper and yet be brought together by bending the paper round. The reader may grasp his argument, but I certainly do not. His idea seems to be that Davidson, stooping between the poles of the big electro-magnet, had some extraordinary twist given to his retinal elements through the sudden change in the field of force due to the lightning.
He thinks, as a consequence of this, that it may be possible to live visually in one part of the world, while one lives bodily in another. He has even made some experiments in support of his views; but, so far, he has simply succeeded in blinding a few dogs. I believe that is the net result of his work, though I have not seen him for some weeks. Latterly I have been so busy with my work in connection with the Saint Pancras installation that I have had little opportunity of calling to see him. But the whole of his theory seems fantastic to me. The facts concerning Davidson stand on an altogether different footing, and I can testify personally to the accuracy of every detail I have given.",1162.0

"
People in ancient Egypt made mummies of their dead as a sign of love and respect. They did the same for their pet cats that passed away.
Experts think that tame cats spread quickly around the ancient world on ships that carried grain. The cats were brought on board to hunt mice. In this way, cats traveled all over Europe and Asia on trade ships. They arrived in China and India about two thousand years ago. In Asia, they helped keep mice away from important papers.
In the Middle Ages (500–1500 CE), however, many people in Europe began to fear cats, believing them to be evil. They had superstitions about wicked people who kept cats and even turned into them. Even so, many people kept tame cats during this time since cats were so useful for hunting pests.
Today’s indoor pet cats live differently from the cats of the past. For thousands of years, tame cats lived mostly outside. They didn’t become house pets until the 1960s, when kitty litter became more common.
Today’s pet cats also look a little different. In the past, tame cats looked like their wild cousins. Many European cats were striped since they often bred with nearby wildcats.In Asia, where no wildcats lived to mix with tame cats, different cat breeds developed over time. The Siamese cat, with its smooth white fur and dark paws, ears, and face, is one example.
In the 1800s in England, people started to breed cats in different colors. The first cat show, where people could go to see “fancy” cat breeds, was held in London. The winner was a Persian cat.
Cats have made friends with people all over the world for thousands of years. Since they first came into towns seeking food, cats have won us over with their playfulness and grace.",945.0
" Consider this: each year in the United States, there are more than one million collisions between vehicles and animals. These crashes kill over 200 people per year and cost billions of dollars in repairs, cleanup, and hospital bills. Building more animal crossings would lower the number of crashes. For example, the crossings in Banff cut the number of animals killed by vehicles by more than 80 percent. The smaller number of collisions saves money and the lives of humans and many other animals.
Sometimes these crossings can save animals from extinction. The number of grizzly bears in Banff is very low. A few adult females killed on the road could have meant the end of these bears in the park. Thanks to the passages, though, the grizzly bears can cross the highway safely. For other endangered animals, a safe crossing may not only save the animal, but the entire species.
Ecopassages also help large animals find food. Mountain lions and bears may roam hundreds of miles during the year to find prey. Roads can cut up habitats and sometimes keep animals from being able to move freely. Species that can’t cross roads to reach food have less of a chance to survive.
Animals need to find mates, as well. Roads can keep members of the same species apart. If they can’t find a mate, they can’t have babies. Without babies, a species can quickly disappear from an area. In some cases, it can even lead to the extinction of a species.
Imagine you are the turtle again. The metal monsters race by. This time, though, someone has built an animal crossing. You happen to look down and spot a tunnel that leads underneath the road. You slowly make your way toward the tunnel. You are safe for one more day.",857.0
") The laws also set the lowest pay allowed. The laws helped make sure workers earned at least enough money to meet their basic needs.
The laws also said hourly workers had to be paid extra when they worked more than forty hours each week. Workers earn one-and-a-half times their usual hourly rate for each extra hour they work. This law was meant to keep companies from forcing people to work too many hours. The laws also made safety rules and said that young children could not work at many types of jobs. Children now had to be sixteen years old to work during school hours. They could be fourteen for some after-school jobs.
Labor Day was first celebrated in New York City in 1882. In 1887, Oregon became the first state to pass a law making Labor Day a holiday. Thirty more states did the same before the U.S. government made Labor Day a holiday for the whole nation in 1894.
Canada also celebrates Labor Day on the first Monday in September. More than sixty other countries instead celebrate a holiday to honor workers on May 1. The president and other people give speeches on Labor Day. Many towns and cities hold parades and other celebrations. This holiday also marks the beginning of the fall sports season.
Workers standing together changed the way they were treated and paid. They set limits for working hours and made workplaces safer. They ended child labor and made the lives of workers better. Labor Day honors all these things. It also honors the efforts of American workers to build their country. So enjoy a day off on Labor Day and have some fun. Also take a moment to remember the people who worked to make the lives of every American worker better.",925.0
" If they break down, they can sometimes take months or even years to repair.
Building tunnels through soft ground, such as sand or gravel, can be dangerous. The earth can easily collapse. To stop this from happening, workers push a steel cylinder called a shield into the earth for support. They then dig out the material within the shield. Next, they install a liner, which is often made of steel or concrete. With that complete, they push the shield deeper ahead and repeat the process. Marc Brunel invented the method in order to build the Thames Tunnel in the 1840s.
Building tunnels under bodies of water presents additional challenges. In many instances, workers make a trench while building sections of the tunnel aboveground. When the trench is complete, the sections of tunnel are sunk and connected together. When everything is sealed, the water is pumped out of the tunnel. The Marmaray Tunnel, which connects the European and Asian sides of Istanbul, Turkey, was built using the trench method.
The Channel Tunnel, which crosses under the English Channel between England and France, was built using another method. Eleven tunnel-boring machines began work on either side of the tunnel. They met in the middle two years later, and the tunnel was finally opened four years later, in 1994.
These amazing tunnels help millions of people and tons of goods move each day all around the globe. As people continue to create newer, faster, and better modes of transportation, they still come across the same obstacles. To get people where they’re going faster, new tunnels will need to be built. Fortunately, technology allows for the construction of longer, deeper, and wider structures more easily and safely than ever before. Who knows what amazing tunnel will be built next?",1000.0
" Mike was very industrious and worked hard every day to do his best. His perseverance paid off. At the end of eight years of hard work, to his surprise, Coach Pat told him he was ready to compete. Mike was one of the members of the Washington team chosen to compete in the 1999 Summer Games in North Carolina. He finished in the middle of his heat, and everyone was pleased with his performance.
In 1968, before the Special Olympics Summer Games, Eunice Shriver gave a speech and said, “In ancient Rome, the gladiators went into the arena with these words on their lips: ‘Let me win.

Because spawners are the favorite food of bears and eagles, the trip upstream is dangerous. Bears can be spotted fishing for salmon on the banks of rivers and estuaries. Bears need a great deal of body fat to make it through the winter. Salmon skin is loaded with fat. If there are many salmon, the bears will eat only the nutritious skin and discard the rest.
Eagles also love salmon. They catch their own, or they eat what the bears have left. Humans also eat salmon. Salmon are a link in the food chain, and if they are disturbed, the bears, eagles, and humans will be, too.
Water is again critical to spawners. Humans have constructed dams in many rivers, and this prevents spawners from returning home to spawn. Fewer eggs mean fewer new salmon and less food for birds, bears, and humans. Water is part of the spawners’ environment, and if it is disturbed, the salmon, bears, birds, and humans will be, too.
Once the spawners make it home, the females lay eggs and the males fertilize them. One week after reproducing, the salmon die. But they do not go to waste. Birds, bears, and other animals consume their bodies. Nutrients from the spawners’ flesh and bones also provide food for plankton.
Salmon are amazing. They begin their lives in a riverbed or streambed, travel to an ocean, and return to the place they were born. Their bodies transform at each stage of their journey. Salmon are important links in many food chains. These food chains change during different parts of a salmon’s life. What happens to salmon affects what happens to other living things in these food chains.",802.0
" The bar is raised higher until only one person can jump it. In the long jump, athletes leap as far as they can. In the pole vault, athletes use a pole to help them leap over a very high bar.
Gymnasts leap, flip, and twirl through the air. They demonstrate their timing, balance, flexibility, strength, and skill. Only women compete on the balance beam and in the uneven bars events. In the balance beam events, they must turn and flip on the narrow beam. Only men compete in the rings, pommel horse, and parallel bars events. In the rings event, they hold onto the rings and flip their bodies in circles.
Olympic fencers duel with practice swords. They score points by touching their opponents with their swords on different parts of the body. Fencers wear protective masks and clothing and use special swords so that the competition is safe. Fencers are allowed to move forward and backward as they fight, but they can only move a little from side to side. Fencers use three different kinds of swords in their competitions.
One event created specifically for the Olympics is the pentathlon. The founder of the modern Games, Baron Pierre de Coubertin, created this event. He was inspired by the pentathlon in the Ancient Olympics. The name pentathlon comes from the Greek words for five and contest.
The pentathlon is based on an imaginary scenario of a soldier who is trapped behind enemy lines. The athlete must ride a horse, shoot targets with a pistol, fight with a sword, run, and swim. The competitor with the best total score in all five events wins. Both men and women compete in the pentathlon.
The Summer Olympics include twenty-seven sports with hundreds of events. To find out more about the Olympics, go to www.olympic.org.",846.0

Then he sold these new recycled products to people who needed them. He rarely needed new things made from natural resources such as trees. He believed that by recycling things that were already made, the citizens wouldn’t need to use up the land and other resources, and the land could be saved. Randy went to present his plan to the king.
“The Three-R Plan”
By this time, the king and queen already had heard many plans. The men were weary by the time they arrived, but they still had hope. Each man, one at a time, presented his plan to the king and queen, and each man agreed that the others had good plans as well. The king and queen also thought each plan had benefits and were willing to try each one. “Let’s try all three at the same time,” said the queen. “The one that shows the best results will be accepted as the plan to save our kingdom.” Things didn’t happen overnight, but improvements were soon seen. The forests started to regrow, and the water cleaned itself out and ran clearer. The animals became healthier. People enjoyed working toward their common goal. Although they all were still busy, they talked and laughed more often with each other. Everyone felt more ownership in the plan.
The king and queen decided that all three men should live in the castle. They called the plan “The Three-R Plan” and invited Randy, Roger, and Ricardo to stay at the castle. None of the men accepted the royal offer. The men already considered themselves stewards of the land and were pleased that the rest of the kingdom did, too. With the Three-R Plan—reduce, reuse, and recycle—the land improved, and all the citizens of the kingdom were happy.",886.0
" The fire is likely to burn for many more years.
Water can be just as deadly as fire. Okuma, Japan, was a peaceful coastal town before March 2011. A powerful earthquake struck off the coast of Japan. The earthquake caused huge tsunami waves that hit a nuclear power plant. As a result, a huge amount of harmful radiation was released into the air. People living near the plant, including thousands from Okuma, had to move away. Several years later, radiation remains high in Okuma. No one knows when—or if—residents will be allowed to return.
Towns are sometimes abandoned because they are too remote. St. Kilda, Scotland, is a group of small islands 110 miles (177 km) off the west coast of the Scottish mainland. Fewer than two hundred people lived on the islands for more than two thousand years. Over time, the islands had too few resources for residents, including the means to grow enough food or heat their homes. Also, many young people moved away, and others were lost to illness. Life in such a remote place simply became too difficult. The last thirty-six St. Kildans were taken to larger islands in 1930.
Most ghost towns were once lived in, but the world’s largest ghost town—actually a ghost city—has always been empty. In the early 2000s, a huge coalfield was discovered in Ordos, in northern China. Kangbashi New Area was built to house hundreds of thousands of people. However, it was poorly planned. Kangbashi is too large and too expensive. The brand-new city stands mostly empty.
Ghost towns can be old or new, and they exist for many different reasons. However, they all have one thing in common: they are lonely places with secrets to share. Learning their stories brings life to places where only shadows and memories may remain.",892.0
" She was also light on her feet and exact in her movements. Tallchief danced in a grand yet free way that set her apart from other ballerinas. She was also respected for her intelligence and honesty.
In 1965, at age forty-one, Tallchief grew tired from all her hard work. Nine years earlier, she had married Henry Paschen, and they had a daughter together. Tallchief stopped dancing and moved to Chicago, Illinois, to be with them. In 1975, Tallchief became the creative director of the Chicago Lyric Opera Ballet. She started the Chicago City Ballet in 1980 because she felt that Chicago should have a leading ballet company. She was its creative director until 1987. Many of her students later became very successful in the world of ballet.
14 Maria Tallchief’s Life Tallchief also spent time preserving the work of Balanchine, who died in 1983. She felt strongly that his ballets should be danced the way he had choreographed them. She and several other Balanchine ballerinas recorded parts of his ballets. That way, future students could learn from them. In 1996, Tallchief became a member of the National Women’s Hall of Fame. This award honors people whose artistic gifts have improved American society. Tallchief died at age eighty-eight on April 11, 2013, in Chicago. People around the world praised her life and work.
Maria Tallchief was an American treasure. As the first prima ballerina from the United States, she helped inspire a new style of ballet. As ballet’s first Native American star, she opened its doors to people of all backgrounds. Her grace, talent, and achievement helped move the world of ballet forward. A fellow dancer, Jacques d’Amboise (ZHAHK dahm-BWAHZ) once said of Tallchief, “There is one word for her: grand. She was absolutely grand.”",929.0
" However, many face natural changes as they grow older. These can include a sudden desire to hunt, escape, or find a mate, which can lead to aggressive behavior. Many owners are taken by surprise when a once-friendly pet turns vicious.
Television, movies, and social media have helped make exotic pets popular. Many people want the animals they see on-screen. For example, sales of snowy owls grew quickly after the Harry Potter movies. Sadly, many owners who buy exotic animals find them too difficult to care for. In those cases, the pets are often abandoned or neglected.
Another risk from owning an exotic pet is disease. The U.S. government reports that almost 75 percent of new diseases in humans can be traced to animals. In some cases, these illnesses spread through contact with a pet. One example is salmonella, a dangerous disease that spreads from pet reptiles to about seventy thousand humans each year.
People disagree about whether humans should own exotic animals. Some believe humans have the right to keep any animal they want as a pet. Others believe that the danger to both the animals and humans is too great a risk to take. Still others believe wild animals have a right to freedom and can never be happy as pets.
Humans will always be interested in exotic animals. However, although owning an exotic pet may seem fun, the harm it causes to the animals can be great. Luckily for us, there are other ways to enjoy exotic animals. We can watch them on television or over the Internet as they roam free in their natural habitat. We can visit them in places where they are provided with everything they need to thrive. After all, it is much more fun to watch animals when we know they are happy and healthy.",995.0
" Today they are called First Nations and the Inuit. The first people from Europe to arrive sailed from Greenland more than one thousand years ago, but they did not stay. In 1497, explorer John Cabot arrived and claimed the land he saw for England. Then the French sent explorers to claim land for France. As more explorers came, they found codfish and fur. These items made money in Europe, so many more communities developed in the region. In those days, France and England were often at war against each other in Europe and in their communities in Canada. When England won most of the battles, France lost its lands in Canada. People still wanted to be free from English rule. In 1867, Canada became a country with its own government. In 1931, Canada became free, while staying loyal to England.
Canadians celebrate their country’s birthday every July 1 with fireworks and parades. They also celebrate the old west with bull riding, steer wrestling, and more in Calgary every summer. Winter is one thing that people celebrate everywhere in Canada. People in different areas may enjoy ice-skating, dogsledding, skiing, and more. A winter festival in Quebec is the largest such event. People can enjoy a snow-carving contest, visit an ice castle, and even stay in a hotel made of ice and snow that is built every winter and melts away every summer.
Canada is one of the largest countries on Earth, stretching “From sea to sea.” It has regions of ice and snow, tall mountains, endless forests, and big cities. The people who live there may speak French, English, or one of many other languages, but they are all Canadian and proud of their country.",954.0

Our best hope is finding ways to use less water and keep more groundwater in the ground. Experts estimate that about 65 percent of the fresh groundwater Americans pump to the surface is used to irrigate crops. Yet many forms of irrigation waste water. They spray and sprinkle water on the surface, where much of it is lost to evaporation. More farmers are using new ways to make sure every drop counts. New meters monitor moisture in the soil and turn the irrigation on and off to waste less water. Many fruit and nut orchards now bury irrigation pipes to waste less water, too.
Planting different crops can also help conserve groundwater. In states such as Kansas and Iowa, some farms are switching from corn to other crops, since corn requires a lot of water. Farmers need new ways to farm. If they do not choose to conserve water, empty aquifers will force them to.
Record drought forced California to conserve water. In just six months, people there went from using as much as 140 gallons (530 L) per person to just 67 gallons (254 L) a day, on average. Across the United States, small changes in water use can save hundreds of gallons in the average American home each week.
By installing low-flush toilets and taking shorter showers, we can use less groundwater. Another small effort that can save gallons is running only full loads in washing machines and dishwashers. Some people are also saving water by replacing thirsty grass in their yards with plants that need less water. Saving our groundwater isn’t easy. People need to drink. Farmers need to irrigate crops to grow our food. Still, we can be smarter about how we use this resource, both now and far into the future.",1009.0

Roller-coaster riders will enjoy the Space Shot at Space Camp in Alabama. It shoots riders upward at a high speed. Those who ride the Space Shot feel as though their bodies are much heavier than normal due to the pressure. The G-Force Accelerator is a spinning ride. It spins quickly, creating a pressure that pushes against the body. It creates the same amount of force astronauts feel during a rocket launch.
Simulated space missions are another popular space camp activity. Teamwork and leadership are important parts of being a good astronaut, and these missions let trainees practice both skills. At some camps, they take part in video game–like simulations. One mission has participants launch the shuttle. They fly it to the International Space Station and then dock with the ISS. Team members perform their own duties, but they must also talk with each other on their headsets. Some trainees work as astronauts. Others work in Mission Control, the command center back “on Earth.”
Some simulated missions include voyages to the Moon. Others take place on models of a space station. The crew must be prepared to think fast if the simulator makes up an emergency. For example, they might have to deal with a simulated meteor shower. For older trainees, a few space camps have created simulations for future missions, including a mission to Mars.
Astronauts of the Future?
Today’s space camp trainees may be the astronauts of tomorrow, like Dr. Kate Rubins. NASA is working closely with other space programs to plan a mission to Mars. They hope the mission will take place in the 2030s. Current space camp trainees could be part of that mission. They could be the first people to leave footprints in the red soil of Mars.

" I became frustrated and afraid. At 3:00 a.m., I gave up trying to sleep and decided to pack my belongings, eat breakfast, and start hiking. What followed was the most amazing sunrise I had ever seen, all alone on a mountaintop. I had faced a challenge that at first seemed impossible but over time transformed into something incredible. Many people have asked me, “How did you do it?” I tell them that I hiked the Appalachian Trail the same way you do anything else: one step at a time. People have also asked me, “Why did you do it?”
Looking back, the reasons I kept going were different from my reasons when I began. I felt so surrounded by love and support from those around me and at home that I never wanted to stop. I’m writing this book several months after finishing my thru-hike. My knees still hurt from those five million steps. I was away from people I love for six months. So you might be wondering, was it worth it? I followed a dream, one step after another, for five million steps. No one can ever take that accomplishment away from me. It took months of careful preparation to hike the A.T., and failure was always looming. I faced many dangers and challenges along the way. I planned, saved money, and learned to live on a tight budget. I also learned to value every item I carried because my life depended on it. I made friends from around the world, and I grew closer to the people in my life who were cheering from the sidelines. Despite all the challenges, in the end, thru-hiking was an invaluable experience.",916.0
" Mazinger Z was a popular mecha that was shown in Japan during the 1970s.
Modern anime, like manga, features characters and story lines created for specific audiences. Shonen—manga made for boys—stars male characters, with plots that include action and comedy. The popular shonen Dragon Ball Z was first aired in Japan in 1989. It continues to be shown on television stations throughout the world. Shojo—manga made for girls—at first starred female characters with plots that focused on emotions and relationships. It soon changed to include more active characters involved in romance and adventure. The 1990s anime series Sailor Moon by artist Naoko Takeuchi is a classic example of shojo. It tells the story of a girl who gets special powers. She uses them to protect Earth from evil forces.
In the 1980s and 1990s, Japanese studios began to make anime films. Many became hits around the world. In 1984, Hayao Miyazaki released Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind, which saw great success. It told the story of a young princess who must save her planet. In 2001, the Japanese anime Spirited Away was made. It brought the tale of a young girl who enters the spirit world to the big screen. The director, Hayao Miyazaki, received much praise for the film. It eventually won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature. Anime is an important part of the latest twenty-first-century media, too. Favorite characters such as Astro Boy, Digimon, and Dragon Ball Z fighters spring to life in video games. Players control the characters’ actions and guide them to complete missions with the push of a button. Just like figures from long ago, the images on the screen act out stories of adventure and daring. The dynamic characters in anime, though, take modern storytelling art to a whole new level.",972.0

In May of 1889, a dam near Johnstown, Pennsylvania, suddenly burst. A wall of water swept away the town. Over 2,200 people died in one of the worst disasters the United States had ever known. Clara and her Red Cross workers went straight into the devastation. Clara stayed in Johnstown for five months, helping survivors rebuild their health and lives. The American Red Cross won the deep admiration of the whole nation.
For years, Clara ran the American Red Cross however she saw fit. She used her own money and never kept many records. Before the government would renew the Red Cross’s charter or detailed contract, however, it insisted that she make things more official. Clara refused to change her ways. In 1904, she resigned as president. Clara was now eighty-one-years old, but she wasn’t done yet. She started the National First Aid Association of America, which made popular the single-box “first aid kit.” As she reached ninety, Clara finally began to slow down. On April 12, 1912, she passed away in her home in Glen Echo, Maryland, surrounded by friends.
Clara’s work with the American Red Cross was the start of modern humanitarian aid. She expanded the role of the Red Cross to include natural disasters as well as war. Today, the Red Cross is often the first organization on the scene of a hurricane, earthquake, or flood. They set up field hospitals to care for people who are hurt and sick. They organize donations and distribute food, clothing, tents, clean water, and medicine. Clara Barton believed that all people deserve health and dignity. Throughout her long and busy life, she showed how to care for others when they need it most. Today, 97 million volunteers, members, and staff in 187 nations follow in Clara Barton’s footsteps.",918.0

Three weeks later, Patrick stood on the deck of the Donegal with his family. Before them the buildings of New York City came into view. At last, they had made it to America! On the docks, Patrick could see the activity as other ships were unloading from their own ocean journeys. Patrick could feel the energy and bustle of this new, growing city, so different from the centuries- old calmness of Dublin.
“Why, Patrick, my boy!” he heard a familiar voice behind him. It was First Mate Thomas O’Brien, whom he had not seen for several days. Thomas came up to Patrick and put his hand on Patrick’s shoulder.
Looking at Patrick’s father, Thomas said, “You know, Mr. Kelly, none of us would be here in New York right now if it weren’t for your son here.” He looked down at Patrick and gave his shoulder a friendly shake. “What he did up on that mast in the storm was quite courageous. Quite remarkable.”
“Thank you, sir,” Patrick said, a little bit embarrassed.
“Well, we are all very proud of Patrick,” Mr. Kelly said, looking fondly at his son. “And we are also very thankful to you and the rest of the crew of the Donegal,” he continued. “Thanks to you, my family now has a chance for a new life—a better life—here in America.”

" Their immune systems could easily fight off the mild cowpox and learn about that type of virus. Later, if smallpox tried to invade their bodies, their immune systems would recognize the pox virus and remember how to defeat it. His idea was correct. These people did not get the deadly smallpox virus. His idea saved many thousands of lives.
Scientists discovered that some microbes naturally fight other types of microbes and kill them. They can do this without harming healthy cells or helpful microbes. These killer microbes produce medicines called antibiotics. When scientists first discovered antibiotics, they considered these medicines to be “magic bullets” because they would directly attack the targeted infection and leave nearby healthy cells alone.
An antibiotic medicine kills most microbes that cause a disease. But the strongest microbes sometimes survive. Often, these hard-to-kill microbes change themselves just enough to hide from the antibiotic. Other antibiotics have become overused, or misused, so microbes have developed a resistance to them. Scientists keep trying to produce new antibiotics to fight stronger, deadlier microbes.
Microbes live in, on, and around almost everything. Most of them are harmless, but some microbes cause disease. There are many ways to prevent diseases from spreading. Some are simple things, such as washing your hands before eating or handling food and after using the bathroom. Other efforts, such as treatments of vaccines and antibiotics, are the result of two hundred years of scientific discovery, research, and modern medicine. Many countries, organizations, and individual doctors are coordinating their efforts to control and even eradicate many diseases. Even with all of this effort, we will never be able to wipe out all of the world’s harmful microbes—but we can learn how to fight them and to be healthier.",1036.0
" In 1850, Congress passed the Fugitive Slave Act. The act made it a crime to harbor runaway slaves, even in free states. Law officers could receive a handsome reward for capturing and returning escaped slaves to their owners.
Two bounty hunters from Georgia named Willis Hughes and John Knight arrived in Boston. They were intent on making money by bringing the Crafts back to Georgia. They met with fierce resistance from the people of Boston, who knew of the Crafts’ incredible and brave journey. Bostonians warned William and Ellen and harassed the bounty hunters. The terrified Crafts hid with friends while being hunted, but they could not bear to live in fear. In December 1850, they set out on another journey, this time to England.
The Crafts settled in West London and had five children. They gave lectures against slavery throughout Great Britain. In 1860, William published a book about their harrowing tale of escape. The Crafts became teachers, ran a boarding house, and engaged in other business ventures to support their family. In 1870, several years after slavery had been abolished in the United States, the Crafts returned to their homeland. They settled outside Savannah, Georgia. They purchased 1,800 acres (7.3 sq km) of land with money raised from antislavery supporters and friends in the North. They also launched the Woodville Cooperative Farm School in 1873. The school’s goal was to educate freed slaves so they could enjoy the same opportunities the Crafts had. Although the school was initially successful, it soon ran into money problems and closed in 1876. After fleeing many miles over many years, the Crafts moved to Charleston, South Carolina. Charleston had been one of their destinations during their escape. They spent their last years there together in freedom, just as they had always dreamed.",1006.0

“Look, it’s curving around and coming back,” Mitts Morgan shouted. “It sure is,” Jess said. He could hardly believe this wasn’t his imagination.

For his final task, the hero descended into the Underworld, the land of the dead. His mission was to capture Cerberus, its three-headed guard dog. He easily overpowered the monster. By completing his final task, Hercules had finally cleansed himself of his murderous crime. Hercules had earned forgiveness and could continue on with his life.
After completing his labors, Hercules went on to accomplish numerous other heroic feats. He married a woman named Deianira. This second marriage was also ill-fated. A centaur named Nessos offered to carry Deianira across a deep river. Midway across, Nessos attacked Deianira. Hearing his wife scream, Hercules shot off an arrow that he had dipped into the poisonous blood of the Hydra. As Nessos bled to death, he rubbed his cloak into his blood, which was mixed with the poison. Nessos whispered, “In the future, if your husband ever wrongs you, give him this cloak. It has been soaked in a special love potion.”
When Hercules and Deianira grew apart, she remembered the cloak. She handed it to Hercules, who wrapped himself in it and was instantly seized with pain. Wild with agony and unable to wash the poison from his skin, Hercules commanded a large pyre to be built. The great hero lay down in the midst of the flames, hoping to perish and end his torment. Zeus looked down upon the pyre from Mount Olympus, deeply moved. Turning to Hera, he said, “Has he not suffered enough? Let your anger be stilled.” Hera bowed her great head and agreed.

When a big branch bent down to seize him the Woodman chopped at it so fiercely that he cut it in two. At once the tree began shaking all its branches as if in pain, and the Tin Woodman passed safely under it.
“Come on!” he shouted to the others. “Be quick!” They all ran forward and passed under the tree without injury, except Toto, who was caught by a small branch and shaken until he howled. But the Woodman promptly chopped off the branch and set the little dog free. The other trees of the forest did nothing to keep them back, so they made up their minds that only the first row of trees could bend down their branches, and that probably these were the policemen of the forest, and given this wonderful power in order to keep strangers out of it.

As she said this, she looked up, and there was the Cat again, sitting on a branch of a tree. “Did you say pig, or fig?” said the Cat. “I said pig,” replied Alice, “and I wish you wouldn’t keep appearing and vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.” “All right,” said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly, beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which remained some time after the rest of it had gone. “Well! I’ve often seen a cat without a grin,” thought Alice, “but a grin without a cat! It’s the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!” She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of the March Hare: she thought it must be the right house, because the chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur. It was so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the left-hand bit of mushroom, and raised herself to about two feet high: even then she walked up towards it rather timidly, saying to herself, “Suppose it should be raving mad after all! I almost wish I’d gone to see the Hatter instead!”",923.0
" When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to find quite a large crowd collected round it. There was a dispute going on between the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once, while all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable. The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle the question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly what they said. The executioner’s argument was, that you couldn’t cut off a head unless there was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do such a thing before, and he wasn’t going to begin at his time of life. The King’s argument was, that anything that had a head could be beheaded, and that you weren’t to talk nonsense.
The Queen’s argument was, that if something wasn’t done about it in less than no time she’d have everybody executed, all round. (It was this last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious.) Alice could think of nothing else to say but, “It belongs to the Duchess. You’d better ask her about it.” “She’s in prison,” the Queen said to the executioner. “Fetch her here.” And the executioner went off like an arrow. The Cat’s head began fading away the moment he was gone, and, by the time he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely disappeared; so the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it, while the rest of the party went back to the game.",1084.0
" Now that life on her farm was comfortable, could Laura do the same?
Books Once home, Laura began to pour her memories onto the page. Sometimes she would stay up all night writing at a little desk that Manly built for her. Soon she had written an entire book about her early years under the towering trees of Wisconsin. She called it Little House in the Big Woods. Rose sent it to a publisher. Sixty-four-year-old Laura didn’t think much would come of it. After all, it was the 1930s. People had cars, electricity, radio—who wanted to hear about doing backbreaking chores in a dark forest? The book was an immediate sensation. Laura brought to life the howling winter wind, the crackling fire, and the joyful skip of Pa’s fiddle. She captured the thrill of meeting animals in the wilderness. She evoked the joy that a simple rag doll could bring to a pioneer girl who lived in a rough log cabin. The mailbox at Rocky Ridge overflowed with letters from young readers begging for more. Laura recounted her time on the Kansas prairie in Little House on the Prairie and near Walnut Grove in On the Banks of Plum Creek. The frightful winter in De Smet became The Long Winter, and the town’s recovery became Little Town on the Prairie.
Laura loved answering letters from her fans and traveling to readings and book signings, but she was always happy to return home to Manly and Rocky Ridge Farm. The couple both lived into their nineties. After Laura’s death in 1957, her books lived on, even becoming a TV series in 1974. Laura Ingalls Wilder’s stories of pioneer life still captivate young readers today. Her life has become part of American history.",944.0
" These illustrations show how the tip of the Indian plate has been pushed upward to form the Himalayas by the pressures of the colliding plates. The Indian plate is still moving, causing the Himalayas to continue to grow.
The study of plate tectonics tells us a lot about how Earth has changed over the years and how it will continue to change. Plate tectonics is still a new science. Over time it will offer many more insights into how the Earth is made. Throughout your lifetime, several major earthquakes and a few serious volcanic eruptions will occur. Each of these events will reveal information about how Earth is put together. It is now possible to track these changes on a daily basis. At the end of this book is a list of some books where you can learn more about how Earth changes. You will also find instructions for searching the Web for more information. Some Web sites keep track of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions around the world. The study of plate tectonics teaches us a lot about Earth’s past. It also can suggest Earth’s possible future. For example, many scientists believe that Los Angeles will eventually be right next to San Francisco. Los Angeles is on an oceanic plate that is moving northward. San Francisco is safely on a continental plate and isn’t moving. One day in the far future, Los Angeles may be in the area where Alaska is now.
This is an illustration of the movement of the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate. One day, Los Angeles will be next to San Francisco. Wouldn’t it be fun to live long enough to see this happen? Well, okay, that is a long time. But for Earth, it’s just the blink of an eye.",929.0
" A blanket of sadness covered them both. They shut down the computer and thought about what they had learned. When their mother returned, they told her the legend of the Apache Tears, taking turns naturally, without talking over each other. Mrs. Yates was touched to see how the legend had affected her children. “Can you see the tear of an Apache woman?” Paco asked her as he held his stone up to the light. Mrs. Yates took the stone and let the light filter through it. “I think I do see it,” she said. “It’s a tear for the man she lost, and it’s a tear for the mournful children he left behind.” She gave the stone back to Paco, closed his fingers over it, and squeezed his hand lightly. “It’s a tear that says ‘I wish my children were happy.’” Paco and Tala gave each other a long look. They understood that their quarreling was only adding to their mother’s grief over their father’s death. They understood that their father was not coming back and that they needed to find a way to live in harmony as a family again.
That night, after talking it over, Paco and Tala gave their stones to their mother. At first, Mrs. Yates refused to take them since the stones seemed to have made her children friends again. Eventually, Paco and Tala convinced her that they wanted her to have the Apache Tears, so Mrs. Yates slept with the obsidian stones under her pillow that night. The next day, she went to a jeweler and had the stones made into a necklace. When the necklace was ready, she slipped it on and never took it off again. Apache Tears really had brought them all good luck!",885.0
" “We’d love to keep you both,” she said, twisting a handkerchief in her hand. “But we just can’t afford to, I’m afraid. You’d be welcome back next year, of course.”  Ruth said she would think about it, but that night she packed the leather suitcase and shook Charlie awake. She told him what Mrs. Werner had offered, and though at first he was excited, his smile wilted when she told him they did not want to adopt Ruth, too.
“Gram and Gramps would never separate us!” Charlie protested.  “Of course not,” Ruth said as she buckled the suitcase. “That’s why it’s time to go.”
The train down through California wound through mountains and valleys with trees so tall, Ruth could scarcely believe her eyes. Then the landscape changed to vast fields, putting to shame the little orchard they had labored in. At last, the train slunk down to the big city where Ruth and Charlie’s grandparents lived: Los Angeles, California. They knew exactly where to go because the address was stitched neatly on a label inside their mother’s old suitcase. After hopping off the train, Ruth inquired after directions from a helpful hobo. They walked for hours in the sun until at last they reached a bungalow with a wide wraparound porch. Ruth checked the number on the mailbox against the address inside the suitcase. “This is it,” she said, and reached for the gate. That was when she spotted the markings: Kind woman, read the first. Food for work, read the second.
And the last? Tell a good story. “Come on, Charlie,” Ruth said with a smile, and though her feet were tired, she bounded up the steps. “We’ve got a good story to tell—and I don’t believe we will have to invent one word.”",737.0
" You have managed excellently, and I begin to have great hopes of you. Good Mole! Clever Mole!”  The Toad was simply wild with jealousy, more especially as he couldn’t make out for the life of him what the Mole had done that was so particularly clever; but, fortunately for him, before he could show temper or expose himself to the Badger’s sarcasm, the bell rang for luncheon.  It was a simple but sustaining meal—bacon and broad beans, and a macaroni pudding; and when they had quite done, the Badger settled himself into an armchair and said, “Well, we’ve got our work cut out for us tonight, and it will probably be pretty late before we’re quite through with it; so I’m just going to take forty winks, while I can.” And he drew a handkerchief over his face and was soon snoring. The anxious and laborious Rat at once resumed his preparations and started running between his four little heaps, muttering, “Here’s-a-belt-for-the-Rat, here’s-a-belt-for-the-Mole, here’s-a-belt-for-the-Toad, here’s-a-belt-for-the-Badger!” and so on, with every fresh accoutrement he produced, to which there seemed really no end; so the Mole drew his arm through Toad’s, led him out into the open air, shoved him into a wicker chair, and made him tell him all his adventures from beginning to end, which Toad was only too willing to do. The Mole was a good listener, and Toad, with no one to check his statements or to criticise in an unfriendly spirit, rather let himself go. Indeed, much that he related belonged more properly to the category of what-might-have-happened-had-I-only-thought-of-it-in-time-instead-of ten-minutes-afterwards. Those are always the best and the raciest adventures; and why should they not be truly ours, as much as the somewhat inadequate things that really come off?",-7983.0

In Tornado Alley, the mixing of air from the north and south creates perfect conditions for a tornado.
Because tornadoes are so dangerous, weather scientists do their best to warn people before a tornado arrives. However, there is no way to be sure that a tornado will strike. The National Weather Service (NWS) tries to help people stay safe during tornadoes. If they declare a tornado watch, it is possible that a tornado might develop. The NWS releases a tornado warning when scientists have actually spotted a coming tornado. At this point, it is important to get to a safe place.
The safest place to be is indoors, in a basement if possible. The next safest places are closets or bathrooms. Try to stay away from windows because a tornado can blast through the glass. Get down low to the ground. If possible, go under a heavy table or desk and cover your head. You can even go into a bathtub.
The spinning cloud of a tornado causes things to fly around. Because this can be very dangerous, it’s always important to protect your head. If you can find a mattress or blankets, cover yourself with them. If you are in a tall building, find the stairs. Do not stay inside a mobile home in a tornado. If you’re in a car and can’t escape the tornado, park the car. Leave your seatbelt on and lean forward. If you’re stuck outdoors, lie down flat on the ground, far away from trees.
Tornadoes are amazing—and scary—examples of the power of nature. Weather scientists are working to invent better ways to tell when a tornado is coming. Many questions remain about tornadoes. What really causes a tornado? What is it actually like inside a tornado? Perhaps one day we’ll find out.",783.0
" The patterns found on the Bigfoot prints are like no other primate’s we know of, though.
The most famous footage of Bigfoot was taken in 1967 in Bluff Creek, California. Roger Patterson and his friend were riding on horseback alongside a stream. They rounded a corner and saw Bigfoot next to the water. Patterson’s horse got spooked and reared up, knocking him to the ground. Patterson yanked out his camera and filmed the seven-foot-tall creature walking toward the forest. In the fifty-three second film, you can see a female Bigfoot in motion. Her muscles ripple with her long strides. No one has been able to prove that the film is a fake.
The mystery of Bigfoot has captured the imaginations of people across the globe. Large, hairy apelike creatures have been sighted all over the place, and Bigfoot is known by many names in different countries. The creature is called Bigfoot in much of the United States. In the Pacific Northwest and Canada, Bigfoot is called Sasquatch. In the Himalayas of Nepal and Tibet, it is called a Yeti. The names are different, but the wish to know the truth about Bigfoot is the same.
Bigfoot has been spotted around the world for hundreds of years, so why shouldn’t it show up in my backyard? When I catch it, I’ll prove that Bigfoot is real, but I promise that I won’t hurt it. Once I’m done with the science fair project, I’ll let it go. Wait—there’s something in my trap! This is the moment of truth, when all of my research pays off.

Being new is always difficult, she thought to herself. Everyone always feels uncomfortable at first, but eventually everyone makes friends. She’d been reciting these things to herself for weeks: Since it was the beginning of the year, she probably wouldn’t be the only new one. It wasn’t as though she’d never been to school before. The kids here were exactly like kids everywhere else. But still, each time anything reminded her of school, or even anything school-related, she felt the flutter in her tummy. Flutter when she bought her folders and pencils. Flutter when she saw a TV commercial that took place in a classroom. Flutter as she retrieved her bag and made the last few adjustments to her hair and glasses before stepping out the door. Her new house was close to the school, so she walked. Other people were walking, too—there were students everywhere, it seemed. Some ran, some walked in groups, some got dropped off by their parents. None of them paid any attention to her. She tried to relax. “They don’t know that you’ll be at their school, so of course they won’t pay attention to you. They just assume you’re going somewhere else.”
But she still felt completely ignored when she walked inside the building. She had visited the school a few weeks ago and knew where her classroom was, so she got there early. She put her books on her desk and sat quietly, waiting anxiously for all the kids to come in and sit down around her. When they did, they barely looked at her. After the bell rang, she took a big, deep breath and stood up. “Hello,” she said, trying to hide the waver in her voice. “My name is Ms. Parker, and I’m going to be your teacher this year.”",867.0
" Players need to be in good shape to play well. Field players can cover up to 7 miles (12 km) during a match. They must be able to start and stop quickly. They need to have enough strength to last the entire match.
Pelé is considered the greatest soccer player in the history of the sport. He played center forward for Brazil’s national team from 1956 to 1977. Although he stopped competing more than thirty-five years ago, his record of 1,281 goals during his career still stands. Another bright star of men’s soccer is Lionel Messi, the captain of Argentina’s national team. Messi is known for his lightning speed and amazing control. He was the first player to win FIFA’s award for the best male soccer player four times.
Mia Hamm was the first big star of women’s soccer. She helped the United States win two Women’s World Cups, including the first one, in 1991. She also won two Olympic gold medals. Marta Vieira da Silva is a Brazilian forward. She has been named FIFA World Player of the Year five times in a row, starting in 2006. She was also the top scorer and Most Valuable Player of the 2007 FIFA Women’s World Cup.
Students who don’t already play soccer can find out if their city or town has a soccer club. Clubs may have teams for different age groups. A coach will help build skills and teach the rules of the game. It’s a great way to make new friends and learn about fair play and teamwork.

" Maybe the AFL wasn’t up to the challenge after all? Not so, said “Broadway” Joe Namath, the young quarterback for the New York Jets. He bragged that his team would win the third Super Bowl, against the Baltimore Colts, who were the big favorites. Joe “put his money where his mouth was,” and the Jets upset the Colts 16-7. The Super Bowl was now established as a battleground for football bragging rights.
Interest in the Super Bowl grew quickly. Super Bowl 5, a real nail-biter, came down to the final five seconds. With the score tied 13-13, Baltimore Colts placekicker Jim O’Brien kicked a field goal to win the game. The 1970s also saw the rise of the Pittsburgh Steelers dynasty. The team captured the fans’ imaginations—as well as four Super Bowl championships in six years. Today there are thirty-two NFL teams. Media coverage of the many playoff games leading to the final showdown builds lots of excitement for the Super Bowl.
The biggest football game of the year brings high expectations. Yet what makes the Super Bowl fun is that you never know what will happen. For instance, Super Bowl 24 was a blowout. The San Francisco 49ers trounced the Denver Broncos 55-10. The next year’s Super Bowl was one of the closest games ever. The New York Giants squeaked by the Buffalo Bills 20-19. Maybe this year the lead will seesaw during the course of the game and be decided in the final seconds. Or maybe this will be the year for the first-ever Super Bowl shutout or another surprise that no one can predict.

" To that end, he built a special wire coil. Tesla used the coil to develop new kinds of lightbulbs and to take the first X-ray photographs. In November 1890, Tesla used the coil to do what many people thought was impossible. He sent an AC current through the air to light up a lightbulb.
Soon afterward, he began experimenting with radio waves. In early 1895, Tesla was ready to send a radio signal fifty miles from New York City to West Point, New York. Years of work were lost, however, when an accidental fire destroyed his laboratory. In 1901, an inventor in England, Guglielmo Marconi, used many of Tesla’s ideas to send a radio signal across the Atlantic Ocean. The achievement made Marconi a huge star. People—including Tesla’s rival, Thomas Edison—gave Marconi money to start a radio company. Marconi, not Tesla, got the credit for inventing the radio.
In 1943, Tesla died at age eighty-six while living in a hotel room that had been paid for by Westinghouse. After his death, the U.S. government finally decided that radio was Tesla’s invention, calling him the “father of radio.” Tesla had spent his riches on failed project after failed project and never received the credit he deserved for his research and inventions. Still, the inventor had a huge effect on technology and the shape of the modern His use of alternating current powered modern cities and completely changed life in rural areas that had been without electricity.

" All the time he was away, Caesar had political friends working for him at home. He remained connected with Pompey, who married Caesar’s daughter, Julia. Pompey, Caesar, and a wealthy politician and general named Crassus formed a group that was very successful and powerful.
However, in time, Pompey became jealous of Caesar’s fame. After both Crassus and Julia died, Pompey and Caesar became bitter enemies. Caesar was popular with the common Romans, but Pompey had the support of the rich senators and some of the legions in Italy. Caesar wanted to go back to Rome. The Senate said he must give up his loyal army.
Caesar feared that he might be murdered if he returned alone, so he brought his loyal and mighty army. He was breaking Roman law when he did this, but he believed he had to stand up to Pompey. When Caesar returned, the two armies fought a deadly civil war. Caesar chased Pompey’s troops out of Italy and destroyed them. Pompey was killed.
When Caesar led his army back to Rome, the Senate welcomed him. Caesar accomplished many great things. He passed new laws, built great buildings, and even changed the calendar. The people loved Caesar. However, many members of the Senate did not. They never wanted a king, and they believed Caesar had become one. They hated that he had total power because it made them less powerful. Two years after his return to Rome, a group of senators planned against Caesar and murdered him.
Caesar’s murder led to an even more terrible civil war. When the war was finally over, the Roman Empire was born. The empire that Caesar created would rule over Europe for centuries and shape the world we live in today.",845.0

For the next 22 years, Einstein continued working to expand his ideas into new areas. He believed that he could develop a new theory that would unify his ideas with the latest theories. He worked as hard as he ever had, yet he never achieved the sort of breakthroughs he’d had during the “miracle year” or with his General Theory of Relativity. Despite the lack of new breakthroughs, he continued to give speeches, write articles, and meet regularly with fellow scientists.
“Few are those who see with their own eyes and feel with their own hearts.”
Einstein was not an inventor. Yet his curiosity led to the creation of many useful products. For example, Einstein’s ideas about light led scientists to develop new ways to control light. These developments eventually led to television cameras, remote controls, and flat-screen computers. Einstein was also the first person to think of laser light. Laser light is now used in CDs, DVDs, and supermarket checkout equipment. His proof of the existence of atoms and molecules led to the creation or improvement of a wide range of products. Those products include shaving cream, toothpaste, personal computers, portable phones, and more.
Einstein’s scientific ideas continue to influence new theories. Current ideas about the origins of the universe, the nature of space, and strange objects called black holes all owe a large debt to Einstein.
“The important thing is to never stop questioning.”
Einstein once said, “The most beautiful experience we can have is the mysterious.... It is enough to try to understand a little of this mystery every day.” Until his death on April 18, 1955, Einstein’s curiosity led him to work to understand nature’s greatest mysteries. In doing so, he changed the way people think about time, space, energy, and matter—the foundations of the universe.",1053.0

" This was also the time of the samurai (SA-muh-rye), or fierce warriors who followed a strict code of honor. The samurai were known as brave and skilled fighters. In the nineteenth century, Japan became a democracy, in which people elected leaders to the Japanese parliament. However, Japan still has an emperor.
One of the most important holidays in Japan is the New Year. During this week-long celebration, it’s a common Japanese practice to clean the house and pay any money owed to others. People also send good luck cards to each other. Children receive special toys, such as kites and spinning tops. On New Year’s Day, people often dress in traditional kimonos and eat special foods prepared only for the New Year, such as pounded rice cakes.
Japan grows most of its own rice, which is a staple of the Japanese diet. It is a main part of most meals. Japanese people also rely on the surrounding ocean for food. They include fish and other seafood in many meals. In cities, a type of fast food called sushi (SOO-shee), made with raw fish, is popular. Many Japanese people believe that food should look as good as it tastes. Meals are typically served as several different small dishes, such as soups, noodles or dumplings.

" These vessels were as long as 42.7 meters (140 ft), but were still small compared to the Chinese ships. Many of them had nice, comfortable living quarters. Galleons were capable of serving both as trading vessels and warships. Because of their size, galleons were able to carry many cannons on board, making them dangerous in battle.
In the late 1700s, Captain James Cook undertook some of the greatest explorations of his time. On his first ship, the Endeavour, Cook sailed around the world. His ship was only 32 meters (105 ft) in length. It was smaller than many other ships and had a shallower draft, sitting only 4.3 meters (14 ft) deep when fully loaded. Cook was not only a great sailor, but he also knew how to keep his crew healthy. He made them eat certain foods, such as limes and cabbages, to remain free from disease. Until Cook’s time, up to one-half of the crew on a long voyage would die of scurvy or other diseases. Cook knew his success as an explorer depended on keeping his crew healthy.
By the middle of the 1800s, sailors had explored and mapped most of the world’s coasts. As people settled farther from their homelands, better ships were needed to move people and supplies great distances. Fast ships called clipper ships carried people across oceans in a matter of days. Some of these ships had as many as thirty-five sails. In only a few years, however, the steam engine would replace wind power, ending the age of sailing ships. When we look at some of the ships used by early explorers to sail across oceans, we have to admire their courage. Explorers and their ships of discovery helped create the world we live in.",967.0

Between 2004 and 2012, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal were without question the top male players. They remain two of the best players in tennis history, each with his own style. Nadal has power and a tough spirit. Federer has fancy footwork and smooth hitting. Many considered Federer’s victory in 2007 one of the greatest Wimbledon finals—until 2008 came along. In that final, Nadal and Federer fought an epic tennis battle for nearly five hours. The match ended under a cloak of darkness with Nadal the victor. Many felt they would never see a better match. That was the longest final in Wimbledon history. The longest match came in an opening round in 2010. It took three days for American John Isner to defeat France’s Nicolas Mahut.

Their hit song “Take Five” was the first ever million-selling jazz tune. The music of Dave Brubeck is still relevant today, and he continued to perform before huge crowds and create new music into his 90s.
Who’s making jazz music today? The answer is: Lots of people! The jazz style of music has influenced thousands of musicians—even those who do not play jazz. Classical music, rock and roll, and hip-hop all use jazz rhythms, melodies, and improvisational styles. Jazz is also influenced by many other styles of music. Today, jazz performers blend their music with Latin rhythms and instruments, African drumming and singing, Middle Eastern melodies, and music styles from around the world.
One popular performer is Wynton Marsalis. He plays the trumpet and performs both jazz and classical music. Wynton has won many Grammy awards and performed at sold-out concerts. The entire Marsalis family consists of talented musicians. Wynton’s father, Ellis, is a dedicated pianist and music teacher who taught his sons Wynton, Branford, Delfeayo, and Jason to love and play jazz. Wynton works to inspire young people to love jazz.

Astronauts on the ISS might play cards, read, or write, among other things. Keeping in touch with loved ones is also important. Astronauts are able to make calls and have video chats. Sometimes astronauts answer questions from students all over the world or give video tours of the station. Many just look out the windows or take photos. Who can blame them? The view is pretty amazing.
When people exercise on Earth, their bones and muscles must work against gravity, which makes them stronger. Because of the lack of gravity in space, it takes very little strength or effort to move things that might be extremely heavy on Earth. Because of this ease, astronauts’ bones and muscles weaken over time. Astronauts must work out at least two hours every day. The special exercise equipment in the ISS gym uses resistance to help the astronauts stay strong. Even with a daily workout, most astronauts lose 20 to 30 percent of their muscle during their six-month stay.
When astronauts return to Earth from the ISS, the work isn’t over. Recovery from spending months in space takes a long time. For a six-month stay on the ISS, it takes six weeks of working out to regain lost muscle. It can take a whole year for an astronaut’s bones to fully recover. Astronauts have to work hard, but the time spent living and working in space is worth it. Scientists always keep an eye on the astronauts’ physical and mental health. The information they gather has already helped astronauts live healthier and happier lives. This information might mean the success or failure of future space exploration.",909.0
" As the name suggests, closed eyes move rapidly from side to side. It’s as if they are watching a ping-pong match. Brain activity, breathing, and heart rate are almost at waking levels. Instead of resting, the brain is speeding along, yet the sleeper’s body is completely still. Muscles become almost completely paralyzed during this stage. Perhaps that is because of the wild dreams that take place during REM sleep.
Many things should happen when our tired head hits the pillow. When they don’t, it can cause trouble for us during the day. When we are sleep-deprived, we can become cranky and make more mistakes when working. We are also less creative and have difficulty with problem solving. Our brain doesn’t struggle alone—studies show that the body has a harder time maintaining a stable body temperature without enough sleep. Wounds even take longer to heal.
It is vital to maintain good and consistent sleep habits. Try to go to bed and wake up at the same time each day. This helps keep your body on a regular schedule. It also helps if you limit screen time; try not to watch television, do computer work, or even use a tablet or smartphone right before turning in for the night. Avoid intense activity before going to bed; going for a walk is fine, but anything more could increase your body temperature and make it hard to fall asleep. If you do have trouble falling asleep, try taking a warm bath or shower beforehand. Either one will relax your muscles and help you slip into a peaceful slumber. Good sleep habits keep the body healthy and the mind sharp. Remember, if you don’t snooze, you just might lose!",883.0
" You may also have seen a data map on the weather report that showed how many centimeters of rain fell in different areas. Data maps can show natural or human information.
On this version of my map, I changed the way I drew the trails to show how many people use each path. Four lines mark trails where 30 to 40 people go each week. One line marks trails where 5 or fewer people go each week. Use the key to see how the other trails are drawn. You could use this data map to estimate which trails have the most erosion, or to plan a walking trip on which you wouldn’t run into many other people.
On this version of the map, I used a drawing of a newt to show how many red newts I see in different areas. Each drawing represents five red newts. You could use this map to see if the population of red newts is rising or falling. You could also use it to pick walking trails where you could see many red newts.
Data maps can represent almost any kind of information. Look in newspapers, magazines, and on the Internet to find different kinds of data maps. Remember to look at the key to see what each color or symbol means.

" These included women, farmers, and people who were uneducated or elderly.
Improvements in health care and living standards followed. Then another survey was done in 2015. Those results were compared with the 2010 survey results. The government learned that Bhutan’s overall level of happiness rose by 1.8 percent. More than 43 percent of the population was considered deeply happy.
There were other categories, though, where happiness declined: mental well-being, community strength, and cultural variety. People did less volunteer work than before. Fewer people thought that traditions were important. The Bhutanese government plans to use the information from the survey to increase happiness. They may, for example, schedule festivals that ask for communities to join in ancient traditions. The goal is to have a 100 percent deeply happy population someday.
Other nations around the world have taken notice of Bhutan’s GNH Index. Some have used it to gather information on their own citizens’ happiness. In 2007, Thailand created a national happiness index similar to Bhutan’s. South Korea and Great Britain also developed their own scales based on Bhutan’s GNH Index. In 2009, a major United States survey company took a happiness survey of people in the United States. All these countries saw real value in trying to promote continued happiness among their citizens.
In 2011, the United Nations, an organization of countries throughout the world, conducted its first study of world happiness. The United Nations published its first World Happiness Report in 2012. The report ranked countries based on factors similar to those used in Bhutan’s GNH Index. That same year, it officially declared March 20 the International Day of Happiness. On that day, the Sun is lined up with Earth’s equator, and day and night are equally long. This day represents King Wangchuck’s belief that balance is the key to well-being and happiness.",975.0

Run into the house. It is a hideous damp night. I would rather stay with you than go to Moscow. Good night! Good night, duckies!

"” “We never actually talked about a name, and I thought Colonel Ham would appreciate this,” Marcus said. “It’ll work,” Shelly said, though she couldn’t hide her smile.
We had barely finished setting up when students began to flood the gym. They wandered around for awhile, examining each of the booths. Then, as if someone had shot off a starting pistol, they went on a spending frenzy. By the end of the period, we had only two bags of mints and ten recipes left. Shelly and I each totaled up how much money we had made and figured out our profits. It seemed like a lot to us, but we didn’t know how much any of the other booths had earned. We gave our money to Mr. Bolstead and, with a sigh of relief, went to our next class.
Monday was torture until we made it to Mr. Bolstead’s class. Everyone sat quietly, too nervous to talk, waiting for him to announce the winner. Mr. Bolstead came in carrying three whole pizzas. “I know what you’re all waiting for,” he said, standing at the front of the class, “but I can’t tell you till the end of the period.” The class groaned in unison, and Mr. Bolstead laughed. “You all are just too easy. Okay, the winner is—” he paused and looked around the room before announcing in a loud voice, “Little Dollies’ Mints!”
Shelly and I cheered—Marcus dived for the pizza. He took one slice and then started handing the boxes around to the class. “Selling the recipes was really a stroke of genius,” Mr. Bolstead said. “It made a lot of money.” “Maybe you’ll be a millionaire, too,” Shelly whispered to me, “but only if you have a great manager like me and a great worker like Marcus.”",925.0
"“Seth, a little assistance,” Uncle Jasper says, running ahead of me.“What would you like me to do, irritate their eyes with the dust I can manipulate on this solid ground? Why don’t you do something?”
“I’ve been trying, but nothing is responding! It’s like the sand doesn’t hear me.” Uncle Jasper sounds truly terrified as he gasps for breath. “Qynn, I need you to imagine a wall, taller and longer than any you’ve ever seen, right behind us. Concentrate on it as hard as you can, but don’t stop running.”I try to visualize a massive wall, and my mind is instantaneously drawn to the Great Wall of China. We learned about it in school weeks ago, but that seems like another lifetime. I remember being in awe of how far it spread, the thick stone walls snaking across the countryside, and how many different parts there were.I imagine we’re running away from the wall, but it’s following, growing taller and thicker the farther we go. A grinding rumble similar to what I heard before fills my ears, but this time it’s followed by an explosion. Dust, dirt clods, and stone shower down, and we try to shield our heads as we sprint.
Then, Uncle Jasper freezes, his chest heaving. I slow down as I pass him, and turn around to see an immense wall, just as I imagined it, blocking out the early morning sky. It stretches far off into the distance on either side. The creatures are nowhere to be seen.“Did I do that?” I ask between breaths.Uncle Jasper simply nods, his hands on his hips.“My dear child,” Seth says, the admiration clear in his voice, “in this world, you can do anything.”",812.0
" Imagine you win the popular vote in a state with 24 electoral votes. This means you get all 24 electoral votes for that state.
Are you confused? Just try to remember that on Election Day, voters are actually voting for their candidates’ electors. In order to win the presidential election, you must have the most electoral votes. When a presidential candidate knows the other side has won, the losing candidate gives a concession speech. (Let’s hope it’s not you.) The talk is most often given at campaign headquarters to the people who supported the campaign. Usually, the candidate thanks everyone who helped and wishes the winner luck as president.
The new president has about ten weeks before taking office. That time is necessary for choosing a staff. Presidents select carefully, picking people they trust, whom they’ve worked with or know by reputation. If you become president, you’ll need hundreds of staff members, including the heads fourteen executive departments (such as the Department of Energy and the Department of Defense) who will act as your expert advisors. You’ll also need time to move your family into the White House.
January 20th after Election Day is Inauguration Day, the day a president officially starts his or her four-year term. It’s a huge celebration marking the end of hard campaign struggles. If you win, you’ll be participating in parades, receptions, and balls attended by thousands. The actual swearing-in is a solemn occasion. You will pledge to “faithfully execute the office of President of the United States” and promise to “preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.” Now if you are fortunate enough to be elected as the country’s most powerful leader, you will soon learn that when compared to the responsibilities of the job itself, getting elected was a “piece of cake.”",1047.0
" No oil. She tried the next barrel and was pleased to find oil. As she finished filling her lantern, she heard a cough from inside another barrel. Like puzzle pieces falling into place, Morgiana realized that the oil merchant was a thief, and the other thieves were hidden inside the barrels! Morgiana and the other servants silently glued the barrels closed. Then they rolled the barrels down the hill to where the city soldiers stood guard. Morgiana told the soldiers about the thieves. The soldiers laughed at first, but then they opened one of the barrels and found a confused, and dizzy, robber armed to the teeth. As one group of soldiers set about arresting the robbers, Morgiana led the captain and his men to the mansion.
Chapter 10
The thieves were tried and sent to faraway prisons, where their stories of a magical cave filled with treasure were treated as fairy tales. As promised, Ali Baba gave Morgiana more than enough gold to return to her homeland. She used the gold to start a business that kept her family wealthy for generations. Ali Baba, Fatima, and Vashti returned to the cave again and again, taking more and more riches. They passed its secret location and the magic words needed to enter it on to their children, who lived comfortably enough with what was left of the treasure. By the time their great-grandchildren were born, there was no treasure left. One great-grandchild made some money by showing people the wondrous moving rock, but the novelty soon wore off. He spent the rest of his days living in the empty cave. When he passed on, there was no one left to remember the magic words, and the rock never moved again.",993.0
" This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath, and till the puppy’s bark sounded quite faint in the distance.
“And yet what a dear little puppy it was!” said Alice, as she leant against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the leaves. “I should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if—if I’d only been the right size to do it! Oh dear! I’d nearly forgotten that I’ve got to grow up again! Let me see—how is it to be managed? I suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great question is, what?” The great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round her at the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances. There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as herself; and, when she had looked under it, on both sides of it, and behind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it. She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue caterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly smoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else.",1128.0
" He was about to make Marco Polo famous.
A Million Stories or a Million Lies?
Marco Polo’s account of his years in China first became available in 1298 while Marco was still in prison. Because printing had not yet been invented in Europe, copies of the book were all written out by hand. The book was issued in several languages and under several titles, including The Travels of Marco Polo, which is the title used today. Marco’s memoir became a sensation. And he became well known throughout Europe. People called him Il Milione, an Italian name meaning, roughly, the man of a million stories, or, as some said, the man of a million lies. Most readers of Marco’s book considered it nothing but a collection of tall tales. They refused to believe that China could be so much more advanced than Europe.
Even today, there are doubters. Although most historians think that Marco Polo’s book is a true account of his travels, others disagree. They say he probably went no farther than Persia. There, he could have learned about the wonders of China from Persia’s Mongol rulers. Why do some people still think that Marco Polo lied? It is because he made no mention in his book of some obvious things, such as tea drinking, Chinese writing, and the Great Wall of China. The doubters also point out that Chinese records from the 1200s contain no mention of the Polos. Marco Polo always swore that he was telling the truth. When he was on his deathbed in 1324, the 70-year-old Marco was visited by a priest. The priest urged him to save his soul by admitting that his book was all lies. But Marco refused, saying, “I have not told half of what I saw.”",1002.0
" Harry is my twin!” “That’s right, Harry could possibly be your twin,” said Mrs. Jean. “But he also may not. It may be just a coincidence that his birthday is the same as yours, that he came from the same adoption agency, and that you both have attached earlobes. In order to be certain that he is your twin you should both have your DNA tested. DNA carries your genetic code. If your DNA carries some of the same codes, then you are brother and sister.” “But . . . I thought my twin would be a girl,” said Heather. Mrs. Jean responded, “Only identical twins are the same gender, because identical twins have exactly the same genes. They were born from the same egg that split in two, but fraternal twins were born from two different eggs. They’re more like regular siblings, only they were born at the same time.” “So, if Harry and I get our DNA tested we can find out for sure whether or not we are twins. Let’s go tell Harry!” Heather exclaimed.
The Altos quickly called Harry and his family, who were thrilled to hear that Harry and Heather might be twins. The next night, the Altos invited Harry and his family for dinner. Harry and Heather discovered that there were a lot of things they had in common. Both were left-handed and both laughed as they tried in vain to roll their tongues. Both got their first tooth at ten-months-old and named their first pet Socks. After talking things over, both families agreed to get the children’s DNA tested. However, they all agreed that they had enjoyed each other’s company so much that they anticipated spending a lot of time together in the future, even if Harry wasn’t Heather’s twin.",929.0
" There, the family was split up. Otto was sent to the men’s camp; Edith, Anne, and Margot were sent to the women’s camp. The winter cold, tiny amounts of food, and backbreaking work took a terrible toll. Edith did her best to help Margot and Anne, even giving them all her food, but on November 1 the girls were separated from their mother. The Nazis sent Margot and Anne to a different concentration camp in Germany.
Germany surrendered in May 1945, ending World War II in Europe. Soldiers who freed the concentration camps were horrified by what they found—stacks of bodies and survivors who looked like living skeletons. Trainloads of children, women, and men had been killed there. Otto Frank survived. He returned to Amsterdam, already knowing his wife had starved to death at Auschwitz. However, he held out hope that Margot and Anne still lived. Soon, a friend who had seen the girls in the camps delivered the horrible news: both Anne and Margot had gotten sick and died in February 1945. Anne was just fifteen years old. Miep Gies gave Otto Frank the five notebooks, along with more than two hundred loose sheets of his daughter’s writings. He was immediately struck by Anne’s talent. “I had no idea of the depth of her thoughts and feelings,” he later said.
Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl first appeared in print in the Netherlands two years after the war and eventually became a best seller around the world. For many readers, Anne’s story puts a personal face on the terrors of the Holocaust. She was a young, talented writer whose full life was stolen from her.

" The indigenous people who live there are famous for the drums and violins they make. If you are looking for great beaches and resorts, like Cabo San Lucas, then Baja California is the place for you. It is a peninsula, so water is around three of its sides. In the winter, you can even spot whales swimming along the shore as they migrate south!
You won’t find any Aztec ruins in Baja. Why? Because the Aztecs did not live here! But you can find some ancient cave paintings. Many believe the ancestors of the Cochimi painted the cave pictures. They show people and animals in black and red. Probably the most amazing ancient ruins in this region are the adobe buildings at Paquimé. Adobe is a brick made with mud and grass. Often many bricks were used to create buildings that look like today’s apartment buildings. Between the 900s and 1300s, more than 3,000 people lived in adobe buildings near the Casas Grandes river. No one really knows what happened to the people who lived there.
If you’re not interested in ruins or the beach, you may enjoy whale watching in a boat. In Guerrero Negro, blue whales are often spotted along the Sea of Cortés. If you get seasick, you can visit them and many other sea mammals on land at the nearby Laguna San Ignacio, Bahia de Magdalena. There are also many old Spanish missions in this region. One you can visit is called San Ignacio. It is a mission church from the 1700s. The Museo de las Misiones is part of Misión Nuestra Señora de Loreto.

" His proposed mission, Inspiration Mars, would send two people to Mars on a flyby—around the Red Planet and back—in 2018. If a trip to the Red Planet is still your vision of paradise, Mars One could be the answer. It hopes to send several dozen people to Mars beginning in 2024 to establish a permanent colony. A crew of four would make the first trip and would be followed by four more settlers every two years. This is your chance! Once you turn the required age of eighteen, YOU could possibly go to Mars. There’s just one catch: These trips will all be (gulp) one-way. None of the Mars One colonists can expect to return home.
How many people would want to sign up for a deal like that? Well, lots, actually. As of 2014, more than two hundred thousand hopefuls had applied for the program. Those selected will undergo an eight-year training program. Then, if all goes well, they will embark for Mars. The colonists will live in a base of connected domes containing living and work areas. The base will also have areas for hydroponic farming. The settlers will carry out a variety of tasks. They will study the health effects of living on Mars, research the planet’s geology, and look for evidence of both present and ancient life. But Biosphere 2 holds some cautionary lessons for Martian colonists. That Arizona experiment went wrong in several ways aside from interpersonal conflict. Other problems included crop failures and a rising shortage of oxygen. Those people could shrug and walk out into the fresh air of Arizona. There would be no escape on Mars. The would-be Martians beating on Mars One’s doors are undaunted by the dangers. Their attitude is, “I want to go to Mars! Choose me!”",887.0
") away, settling between a pair of windmills outside the city. The two men were hailed as heroes.
Benjamin Franklin observed the historic flight. Asked by another spectator what this balloon was good for, he reportedly answered, “What good is a newborn baby?” On December 1, just ten days after the Montgolfiers’ triumph, Jacques Charles and Nicolas-Louis Robert made the first human ascent in a hydrogen balloon. Taking off from the Tuileries (TWEE-luh-reez) Garden in Paris, they flew for more than two hours, coming down in a town about 36 kilometers (22 mi.) away. In the following years, the Montgolfiers launched several more balloons. The brothers were honored by the French Academy of Sciences, and their father, Pierre, was made a nobleman by King Louis.
The passion for ballooning soon spread throughout Europe. It was not long, however, before the risks involved became clear. In June 1785, de Rozier and his copilot, Pierre Romain, were killed while attempting to fly across the English Channel in a balloon. Despite the risks, pioneers continued to develop balloon designs long after the balloon craze of the late 1700s had ended. In the 1800s, lighter-than-air vehicles were given rudders and motorized propellers. By the 1930s, huge airships were flying passengers back and forth across the Atlantic Ocean. The golden age of airships ended abruptly when the German airship Hindenburg caught fire and crashed while landing in New Jersey in 1937. Today, airships are mostly used for advertising and can often be seen flying above open-air stadiums during large sporting events. Gas balloons are mostly used for gathering weather data, while hot-air balloons are mostly used for recreation. Many areas hold festivals each year in which hundreds of colorful hot-air balloons fill the sky. These events can make it appear as though balloon mania never ended.",1047.0

" This volcano covers half the island of Hawaii. Mauna Loa has erupted dozens of times since 1843. In 1868, an eruption caused earthquakes and lava flows that lasted four days and destroyed nearly forty buildings.
People have been visiting Kilauea and Mauna Loa for hundreds of years. Early native people made offerings, or gifts, at the volcanoes. Visitors in the 1840s were amazed by the giant lake of lava.
People wanted to protect both the volcanoes and the land around them. President Woodrow Wilson made the area the country’s thirteenth national park on August 1, 1916.
Hawaii Volcanoes National Park covers 520 square miles (1,347 sq km). It extends from Mauna Loa to the coast. As well as volcanoes, it has lava tubes that run across the land and flow into the sea. Lava tubes are big tunnels in the ground formed by lava long ago. They are so big that people can walk through them.
Having a volcano nearby doesn’t keep animals from living there. In fact, hundreds of protected animals live in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. It is home to sea turtles, bats, unusual insects, and over twenty types of songbirds.
The park also has many protected native plants and trees. Almost all the park’s plants are found only in Hawaii. Many plants have lived in and around the volcanoes for years.
Enjoy—But Watch Your Step!
Hawaii Volcanoes National Park is a wonderful place to visit. Drive along a volcano or hike more than 150 miles (241 km) of trails. Bike along a volcano’s paths or camp in the rainforest. The volcanoes are continuously watched for eruptions. When lava flows or eruptions are possible, parts of the park are closed to visitors. This special place is never quiet for long.",801.0

There Can Be Only One!
In October, growers with the biggest pumpkins meet at weigh-offs around the world. It is an exciting time as growers wait to see who has the biggest pumpkin. For winners, the long months of planning, planting, pruning, watering, and care pay off. Their giant pumpkins are some of the biggest in the world!
Growers use forklifts and trucks to transport their pumpkins to weigh-offs. They carefully use ropes, straps, and chains to move their pumpkins. At weigh-offs, pumpkins are weighed on giant scales to see which is biggest. After the contests are over, growers have creative—and delicious—ways of using their pumpkins.
Some growers in countries around the world hollow out their giant pumpkins and turn them into boats. People use paddles to race the boats. Sometimes they wear costumes during the races. A man in the United Kingdom set a new speed world record in 2013. He paddled a hollowed-out giant pumpkin 100 meters—about the length of a football field—in two minutes.
Giant pumpkins can be carved into silly or scary jack-o’-lanterns. Some carvers use power tools to create works of art.
Giant Pumpkin Pie!
Some giant pumpkins are used to make huge pies. Growers of giant pumpkins in Ohio baked a pie that was named the world’s largest in 2010. It was 20 feet (6.1 m) wide and weighed 3,699 pounds (1,678 kg). That’s a lot of pumpkin pie!

" Because it’s so active, the peterbald has a high body temperature. This makes the peterbald a warm and cuddly pet year round! Hairless cats are happy to seek out a warm lap to sit on. Although they lack a thick coat of fur, most actually have a very fine coat. When petted, a hairless cat feels like a fuzzy peach.
Guinea pigs are a popular hairless rodent. One hairless breed of guinea pig is called the “skinny pig.” This guinea pig looks skinny because it doesn’t have a thick coat of fuzzy fur like regular guinea pigs. Unlike their furry cousins, skinny pigs need special care. Without a coat of fur to protect them, skinny pigs can easily injure their skin or get sick. They need to stay indoors where it’s safe.
Another hairless rodent is a rat known as the “fancy rat.” Rats are mostly social animals—they like to be around other rats. Putting hairless fancy rats together with furry rats (fancy or not so fancy) helps keep them happy and in good health.
Hairless animals are found in the wild, too. These animals have adapted to live without a lot of hair. The naked mole rat is a funny-looking rodent that doesn’t have thick fur like most rats. Instead it is covered in wrinkly pink skin.
Naked mole rats spend their entire life below the ground in tunnels. To control their body temperature, they move around. When it’s warm out, naked mole rats move to deeper tunnels where it’s cooler. When it’s cold, the mole rats group together to keep each other warm.

It discovered that Uranus’s sideways position twists its magnetic field into a corkscrew “tail” following the planet. Until then, scientists didn’t even know Uranus had a magnetic field!
When the Uranus flyby went well, NASA sent Voyager 2 to Neptune as well. It reached the planet in August of 1989. There, it discovered five new moons. Then, like Voyager 1, Voyager 2 began its journey toward deep space.
Gathering information is only part of the Voyagers’ mission. They are also carrying information out of the solar system. It’s a message to non-Earth life forms, or aliens. The message is on a twelve-inch “Golden Record” on the side of each spacecraft. The record includes music, art, and spoken greetings from around the world. It also includes sounds from nature. The outside of the record has a map showing Earth’s location in the universe. Aliens could use it to find Earth, but that probably won’t happen anytime soon. Voyager 1 won’t come close to another star for at least forty thousand years!
“The Voyager mission has opened up our solar system,” says project scientist Dr. Edward Stone. The two spacecraft ended up exploring all of the solar system’s giant outer planets and forty-eight of their moons. Now the Voyagers are giving us a first look at deep space. Like two small bottles in the universe’s huge ocean, they carry a message from Earth to whatever lies beyond.",885.0
" I learned in school that a plain is a large, flat area without many trees. The Great Plains formed when two tectonic plates smashed into each other and joined together. Some parts of the Great Plains are flat, and others have hills.
We stop overnight in western Minnesota and drive into South Dakota the next morning. It’s pretty flat until we get near Badlands National Park. We hike in the park and see some amazing rock formations. After an overnight stay, we drive through a corner of Wyoming and pass the Bighorn Mountains on our left. Some of the mountains have snow, but Mom says even bigger mountains are still to come.
After we cross into Montana and pass Billings, Dad says, “Get ready to be impressed!” Soon afterward, I let out a whoop as I see a row of high, snowy peaks—the Rocky Mountains. The Rockies are one of the main mountain ranges in the West. They formed when two small tectonic plates beneath the Pacific Ocean slid under the North American Plate.
After driving across Montana, Idaho, and Washington, I’m excited to see water again. But I’m more excited to see Mount Rainier (ray-NEER), a huge volcano. We drive into Seattle, which is next to Puget Sound, an “arm” or inlet of the Pacific Ocean. We’ve reached the end of Interstate 90, and our search for landforms is nearly over.
One Landform to Go!
For the last landform on my list, we travel one hour north to the Skagit (SKA-jit) River delta. This landform was created when sediments built up where the river flows into Skagit Bay. I’ve seen some amazing landforms on this trip, and I’ve learned so much about how Earth’s surface changes. I can’t wait to tell Mr. Lopez about my summer vacation!",966.0
" Scientists open the door in the dome to let in the outside air. The tour guide explained that you need to keep the temperature of the air around the telescope the same temperature as the air outside. If the two temperatures are different, the air will move and change the image that is seen in the telescope.
Since astronomers use the star telescopes to look at the night sky, they get to stay up all night and sleep all day! Signs outside say, “Day Sleepers. Quiet Please.” My older brother could use one of those signs on his bedroom door.
I study the stars from home with a pair of binoculars or my telescope. A star chart helps me know where to look for certain stars, planets, moons, or constellations. I can see most of these things with binoculars, but I need to use a telescope to see nebulae and most galaxies. Each season, the evening sky looks a little different. As Earth moves and rotates in its orbit, you can see different things. I make sure to have an up-to-date star chart because I want to know what’s in the sky above me each night. I found a cool star chart on the Internet by typing the words star chart into a search engine.
Are you one of those kids who wonders whether astronomers search for aliens in their telescopes? I actually heard someone ask that question during my tour of Kitt Peak. But most people know that’s science fiction, not science. Astronomers, even amateurs like me, study stars, planets, and galaxies, and write about the facts. Science fiction writers study astronomy and use their imagination to tell a story. I think the truth is often much more amazing than any imagined story! Don’t you?",941.0

Puffins mainly eat small fish. In winter, when fewer fish are available, they may also eat squid, shrimp, crabs, and other small animals. Adult puffins eat underwater. They also collect fish to take back to their chicks. Puffins can carry fifteen or more fish in their beak at a time. They hold the fish with their rough tongue and spines on the roof of their mouth.
Humans have hunted puffins for hundreds of years for their meat, eggs, and feathers. In some places, these seabirds are still hunted. Humans also put puffins in danger in other ways. They catch large numbers of the cold-water fish that puffins eat. Warmer ocean water because of climate change also means less food for puffins. Some types of fish that are now common are too big for chicks to eat. Puffins also get caught in fishing nets, and they are hurt by pollution and swallowing plastics. Humans have bothered many of their nesting areas. Puffins are also in danger because of other animals that hunt them, including gulls, eagles, rats, and foxes. In places where puffins live, people are working to solve the problems so these amazing seabirds can stay alive.
To see puffins in the wild, keep in mind that they’re out at sea for many months each year. They’re only on land during the breeding season. They’ll mainly be found on cliffs and islands that are hard to reach. However, it’s worth the effort if you can get there. Choose a place that allows people to look for wildlife. You may have an easier time seeing puffins on a boat tour. You’ll probably be able to see them from a closer distance. Wherever you go to see puffins, take binoculars and a camera. Without a doubt, you’ll enjoy watching these wonderful, special birds.",877.0
" Often, the forty-niners carried disease with them as they drove their wagons the 2,100 miles (3,380 km) to California. Thousands died. By the fall of 1849, the trail was lined with dead oxen and graves.
For those who made it to California, life did not get easier. The prospectors lived in mining camps made of tents and rough shelters. They ate poorly. They worked twelve hours a day shoveling gravel or breaking rocks with picks. Many fell ill, but they kept working. The next pan of gravel might be worth a fortune!
According to the Sacramento Bee, one in every five miners who came to California in 1849 was dead within six months. Even those who found gold often lost it to robbers, gambling, or paying high prices for everyday goods.
Some early prospectors were successful. Once the placer gold was gone, though, most of the riches from gold went to large companies. They were able to dig deep mines. Entrepreneurs made a fortune by selling to the miners. Sam Brannan became one of the first millionaires in America. Levi Strauss made his fortune selling pants tough enough to handle the work—blue jeans. Women, especially, had many more opportunities in the West. They started businesses cooking, running boarding houses, and washing clothes for the prospectors.
The biggest winner was the United States. The gold rush brought about three hundred thousand people to California in a few years instead of a few decades. In 1850, California became a state. By 1863, the country began building the railway that would link East and West. Today, California has more people than any of the other forty-nine states. It has a huge economy. And it still lives up to its nickname: the Golden State.",861.0

In the Philippines, round objects symbolize coins and good luck. On New Year’s Eve, Filipino people wear clothes with polka dots to invite luck in the New Year. They gather and eat twelve different types of round fruit. Filipino people also clean their homes before New Year’s Eve. At midnight, they open all their windows to invite good fortune in.
In parts of Southeast Asia, people celebrate the traditional New Year in late March or mid-April. This is the end of the dry season in Cambodia and other countries. It is a very hot and dusty time of year—a time for water festivals! To prepare for the New Year, people clean dusty statues of Buddha with water. They save the water for priests, who gently pour it onto their shoulders for good luck.
In some cultures, the New Year happens at a different time every year. The Islamic New Year, called Al-Hijra (al HI-jruh), is based on a lunar calendar. This means that it follows the cycles of the Moon. A lunar year is around eleven days shorter than the 365-day solar year, which is based on Earth’s movement around the Sun. The Chinese New Year, called the Spring Festival, and the Jewish New Year, called Rosh Hashanah, follow both the solar and lunar calendars.
Many New Year’s traditions are shared internationally. House cleaning before the New Year is common in many cultures, many cities celebrate with fireworks at midnight, and many people make resolutions for the coming year. New Year traditions around the world share a hope for a fresh start—and a desire to celebrate with music, dancing, and fun! How will you celebrate the New Year?",970.0
" The results were amazing. The code talkers could do in seconds what other coders needed half an hour to do!
The military quickly adopted the code and began training more code talkers. Many Navajo men were eager to serve. All in all, more than four hundred Navajo code talkers served brilliantly in the Pacific. During one of the biggest battles of the war, the Battle of Iwo Jima, six code talkers sent and received more than eight hundred messages in the heat of combat without a single error. One of those code talkers, Keith Little, described his contribution to the battle: “My weapon was my language, and that language probably saved countless lives.”
The Navajo code talkers played an important role in several battles fought in the Pacific during World War II. The Japanese could not make sense of the code. Even after Japan surrendered to the United States on September 2, 1945, the code remained a government secret. The code talkers could not talk about their experiences. They remained silent for years. Despite the code talkers’ loyalty and patriotism, they returned to hard lives after the war. Jobs were tough to find for many former soldiers, and Native Americans often faced discrimination. Navajo and other tribes in Arizona and New Mexico could not vote until 1948. Those in Utah could not vote until 1957.
Finally, in 1968, the secrecy around the code talker program ended. Then the world learned about the amazing contributions of these men. In 2000, President Clinton signed a law awarding medals to the twenty-nine original Navajo code talkers. The unusual Navajo language and the code talkers who spoke it led to the success of the code. To this day, it is the only spoken military code that has never been broken.",1012.0
" Many more space objects could be counted among the dwarf planets as technology makes it easier to identify them.
Asteroids are rocky, metallic objects orbiting the Sun. They range in size from a few feet in diameter to hundreds of miles in diameter. Most asteroids are found between Mars and Jupiter. Some have orbits that cross the Earth’s path, and in the past, some have even crashed into Earth. Asteroids and other smaller objects that enter Earth’s atmosphere are called meteoroids. If they survive the trip and land on the ground, they are called meteorites. If they burn up before landing, they are called meteors. Among the best evidence of an asteroid hitting Earth is the Barringer Crater near Winslow, Arizona.
Comets are composed of ice and dust and are like large dirty snowballs in space. They have very oval-shaped orbits. For part of that orbit, they come close to the Sun, and then they swing far out into space. Some comets orbit the Sun in less than 200 years. The most famous of these is Halley’s Comet. It returns every seventy-six years. Other comets take thousands of years to complete an orbit. Comet Hyakutake, which passed close to the Earth in 1996, will return in about 9,000 years.
Humans have always wondered, “what’s happening out there in space?” For centuries, we could only guess. New rockets, space probes, satellites, and telescopes show us what’s happening in our Solar System every day. These tools have helped scientists to discover new planets, re-count moons, and see stars being born and being swallowed. They have also given us the first full-sky survey map of our universe and a direct view at the Sun. What will they show us next about our Solar System and beyond?",916.0
" Before the canal, people had to sail around South America to get from one ocean to the other. During digging, disease, landslides, and mudslides caused problems. After they finished digging, they built a system of chambers to raise and lower ships from the oceans to the lake. Ships enter chambers on one side of the canal that take them to the lake. The ships make their way across the lake to chambers that take them down to the ocean on the other side. Today, the canal can handle about 50 ships a day; it averages about 14,000 ships a year.
Now we head south from Panama to the countries of Brazil and Paraguay. In 1975, the two countries teamed up to build a hydroelectric plant to produce more electricity for their people. They would build it on the Paraná River, on the border between the two countries, because a hydroelectric plant needs water and a dam to create electricity. Builders overcame big challenges. They changed the course of the Paraná, the seventh largest river in the world. They dug up and removed more than 50 million tons of dirt and rocks. They used enough concrete to build a city for four million people and enough iron and steel to build 380 Eiffel Towers. The result was a series of dams as well as a power plant one-half mile (.8 km) long. The power plant has broken records for the amount of power it produces. It now supplies most of the power for Paraguay and about a quarter of the power for Brazil.
Someday, new lists of wonders will be made. Works greater than these are already being built. However, these Seven Wonders of the Modern World are proof of the power and courage of human beings in the 1900s.",979.0
" When they were finished guessing, they deduced the answer. The holes were used for a temporary scaffold that the artists climbed or stood on as they painted.
What were Stone Age artists like? How did they create color? What tools did they use? What were they thinking? Luckily the artists left all kinds of clues behind on the ground below their masterpieces. Can you guess what tools they used to carve the stone walls inside the cave? The answer is... they used more than one kind of tool, depending on the kind of rock they were carving. If the rock was very soft, they used a stick or their finger. If the rock was very hard, they carved a pointed or rounded stone tool to cut into the rock face.
Other rock faces were impossible to carve at all and had to be painted. Most of the pictures are painted with red and black pigments made from minerals and metals found in the earth.
What else do the caves tell us? Do we know what the carvings and paintings mean? One thing that the caves tell us is that men, women, and children have always drawn pictures and always will. Stone Age people did not live in these caves. They went down into the earth and created pictures that represented something in their lives. Whether they went there just to draw or to be near their ancestors who lived before or to seek help from their Shaman, we may never know. But they were still creating art.
When we look at paintings created fifty years ago or even today, can we understand what the artist was thinking? And do we really need to know, or is it enough to look at a picture and say, “Wow! That’s beautiful”?",789.0
" By this time, both of his parents were dead. His father had died sixteen years earlier, but his mother died just a few months before his return.
Ibn Battuta had been gone for twenty-four years and was now forty-five years old. He was not done traveling, though. He traveled next to Granada, a part of Spain still under Muslim control. Then he went to the Empire of Mali in West Africa. In Granada, Ibn Battuta met with Muslim leaders. He also met a young writer named Ibn Juzayy. They would meet again when Ibn Battuta’s travels were finished.
Ibn Battuta did not want to make the long, difficult trip to Mali. However, the sultan of Morocco ordered him to. The sultan wanted to learn more about the wealthy land. Ibn Battuta spent eight months in Mali as the guest of its ruler. He was impressed by the richness of the sultan’s court. Ibn Battuta returned to Morocco in 1354— this time for good. He was now fifty years old.
In Morocco, Ibn Battuta hired Ibn Juzayy to write the story of his travels. Ibn Juzayy put Ibn Battuta’s stories into a book called the Rihlah (Journey). The book is still one of the best sources of information about the lands and rulers that Ibn Battuta visited in the 1300s. In his final years, Ibn Battuta is thought to have served as a judge, but little is known of his later life. He died in Morocco in either 1368 or 1369.
Ibn Battuta journeyed 75,000 miles (120,000 km) during his lifetime. That’s like going all the way around the world three times! He visited and lived in dozens of countries. He was not an explorer.

Brazil is home to the widest variety of life on Earth. The Amazon rainforest provides a home to more animals—and plants—than any other environment in the world. Colorful birds such as the toucan (TOO-kan) live there, as well as jaguars and ocelots (OS-uh-lotz). Slow-moving sloths hang from trees, and giant anacondas slither along the forest floor. Many different types of monkeys swing from the trees. In the Amazon River, meat-eating fish called piranhas (pi-RAH-nuhz) hunt in groups of one hundred or more. Large manatees swim through the water.
Other parts of Brazil, such as the Pantanal wetlands, also include unique animals. Storks and herons build nests in the Pantanal’s trees. Colorful parrots, such as the blue and yellow macaw, fly overhead. Deer and jaguar roam the land. Giant anteaters also live in the Pantanal. Sadly, some animals in the Amazon rainforest and the Pantanal could disappear from Earth forever. Every year, trees are cut down for timber and to clear land for farming. As a result, animals like the jaguar and the golden lion tamarin, a type of monkey, are losing their habitat. Many organizations are working together with the Brazilian government to keep this from happening.
Brazil is a country filled with life. The Amazon rainforest teems with more living things than anywhere else on Earth. The people in the cities and countryside have vibrant celebrations unlike any other. From its land to its animals and people, the vast country of Brazil has many things to learn about and explore.",972.0

African American brass bands marched down the street playing music similar to jazz. Many drummers marched together in these bands. Each drummer played an individual drum. In the early 1900s, new inventions allowed one drummer to play many drums at the same time. These inventions led to the birth of the drum set.
In 1909, William F. Ludwig invented the first bass drum pedal that was simple and easy to use. This allowed drummers to play the bass drum with one foot. They could then play the other drums and cymbals with their hands. Today’s bass drum pedals are easy to play and adjust.
The hi-hat is a set of cymbals found in a modern drum set. At first, the hi-hat was just a pair of hinged boards with cymbals attached to each board. Drummers tapped the top board with one foot to make the pair of cymbals strike each other. Today’s hi-hat is made of a foot pedal and a stand that holds a pair of cymbals. Drummers can make the cymbals strike each other by using the foot pedal. They can also hit the hi-hat with a drumstick.
Today, drum shells are usually made of layers of maple or birch. Thin layers are glued together in circular presses to make cylinders. Then heat and pressure are used to form the layers into drum shells.
Drummers and inventors have helped to create the modern drum set. But a drum set is only as good as the drummer who plays it. A good drummer is not always the fastest drummer. And a good drummer is not always the drummer who plays the most difficult beats. A good drummer sets the beat and rhythm for the other musicians to play to. To make music with a band, a drummer has to be a team player.",679.0
" Homer wrote about a city named Troy and the Mycenaeans’ fight to win back a woman named Helen. Homer’s tale was believed to be fictional until researchers discovered a very old city in Turkey that seemed to match the city of Troy that Homer described.
Was Crete Atlantis?
Many people are beginning to think that Homer’s tales are real stories. They think the tales tell about real cities and real people who lived a very long time ago. They think that if Homer’s stories have some truth, then perhaps other ancient writers’ tales are also true. An old Greek philosopher (deep thinker) named Plato told a very interesting story. He said there was once a great island country that disappeared. He called the country Atlantis. Plato said Atlantis had been destroyed by a terrible disaster. The disaster caused the country to sink under the sea, never to be seen again. According to Plato, Atlantis was larger than Libya and Asia combined (larger than the continental United States). He wrote that Atlantis’s kings, who were descended from the sea and earthquake god Poseidon, had power over the entire known world.
Because of the greatness of Minoan Crete and the fact that it seemed to disappear, some people think it may be Plato’s Atlantis. Some people think that by studying Plato’s stories about Atlantis, they can learn more about the collapse of the Minoan civilization. Whether or not Crete was Atlantis, many people are intrigued by both mysteries. They like finding a way to solve them. Researchers study evidence in hopes that they might put a piece of the puzzle of Atlantis and the disappearance of Minoan Crete in place.

" The RFC lost 245 aircraft that month, which is remembered as Bloody April.
As his fame grew, Richthofen inspired nicknames such as the “Red Battle Flyer” and the “Red Knight.” The “Red Baron” nickname became popular after the war. In July, Richthofen was badly wounded when a bullet nicked his head during a fight with another plane. He returned to his home in Germany for a month to recover. He healed from his wound but began to lose his taste for battle.
Returning to the front in August, Richthofen traded his biplane and its two sets of wings for a new triplane. The slow but nimble fighter had three sets of wings. It quickly became the aircraft with which he is most often remembered. Though he often suffered headaches from his wound and had grown tired of the war, Richthofen continued to shoot down Allied planes. On April 20, 1918, he scored his eightieth victory. It would be his last.
The next day, while fighting above Allied lines, Richthofen was struck in the heart by a single bullet. He managed to land his plane safely but died moments later. Allied pilots gave Richthofen a funeral with full military honors at a French cemetery. A wreath placed on his coffin read, “To our gallant and worthy foe.” Richthofen’s body was moved to Germany after the war.
No one is certain who fired the bullet that struck Richthofen. Canadians thought it was one of their own pilots, Captain Arthur Brown. However, many historians believe the bullet came from an Australian gunner on the ground. With eighty confirmed victories, Richthofen was the greatest ace of World War I. He was a national hero. Even today, more than one hundred years after the start of the war, people still remember Manfred von Richthofen—the legendary Red Baron.",947.0
" The mirror was off by 1/50th of the thickness of a piece of paper. That amount was enough to make the telescope’s images look blurry and slightly out of focus.
In 1993, astronauts flew to the Hubble and repaired it. After that, the images surprised everyone. No one knew that the telescope would be a source of so much information and beauty. Astronauts visited the telescope four more times. They updated its equipment, proving that astronauts could do complex work in space. With its new equipment installed in 2009, the Hubble looks deeper into the universe than ever before. It can see stars that are dying and stars that are just starting out. Understanding how the universe is put together will help people travel through space. It will also help people who hope to find life on other planets. With its new computers and batteries, the Hubble is expected to continue working for many more years. NASA also plans to launch the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in the near future.
A “Cool” Future:
The JWST will be cool in more ways than one; engineers are designing the JWST to make sure that the telescope will not heat up in space. If the telescope gets too warm, it won’t pick up tiny levels of infrared light. Engineers have built a sun shield the size of a tennis court that will keep the telescope in the shade so it will stay cool enough to do its job.
The new telescope is expected to launch in the near future. It’s bigger than the Hubble and lighter. The whole JWST, including the giant sun shield, will fold up to squeeze into a five-meter cargo bay and then unfold in space. Once there, it will begin its job of taking a long, deep look at our universe.",993.0

For a shorter walk and no stairs, visitors can go to the museum and walk on a glass floor over a scale model of the whole site—pyramids and all.
In 1987, Teotihuacán was named an important world site by UNESCO, an organization that helps protect it. Even so, the many visitors, along with wind and rain, continue to erode the structures. But the greatest threat to the site today may be developers, or builders. In 2004, one developer received permission to build just outside the park. By law, the company had to report any artifacts dug up during construction, but it didn’t. Instead, it trucked the priceless artifacts to the dump because that was faster and easier. These actions led to years of investigation.
There is much to see and explore at this ancient place. In 2003, archaeologist Sergio Gómez visited Teotihuacán during a heavy rainstorm. The rain was a life changer for Gómez. It was early morning when he arrived to find a small sinkhole in front of the Temple of the Feathered Serpent. To explore the hole, he tied a rope around his waist, and several people lowered him deep into the darkness. Far below, Gómez discovered a tunnel that had been sealed 1,800 years ago. It was a discovery of a lifetime. Today, Gómez and his team are excavating the tunnel, inching their way toward its end under the temple. So far they have dug up seventy-five thousand artifacts.

" This means that many Inuit spend their days at jobs other than hunting and fishing. There are also fewer wild animals than before. This makes it harder to hunt.
Today, land in the frozen north is divided between different countries. The Inuit live in the northern parts of Canada, Greenland, Russia, and the United States. In 1999, Canada made a territory for the Inuit called Nunavut. Nunavut means “Our Land.” Its official languages are Inuktitut, English, and French. Now there are also schools in the Arctic. Children spend their days reading and writing instead of fishing and sewing. Inuit elders sometimes visit schools to teach the children Inuit traditions. They help students carve wood, sew animal skins, and tell stories. The elders want kids to remember how their ancestors lived for thousands of years.
If you visited the far north today, you would need to bundle up. Maybe you’d wear a warm jacket, or two or three. If you went in the wintertime, it would be dark in the middle of the day. It would be freezing cold for days and weeks and months. A visit to the Arctic might make you wonder how people can survive in such a harsh environment. During your visit, you would meet Inuit people. You would see how they have blended traditional ways with modern living. For example, you might see an Inuit man wearing blue jeans and a caribou skin parka. You might ride on a sled that is pulled by a snowmobile instead of dogs. Or you might see seal hunters wearing sunglasses instead of wooden goggles. And before going home, you might buy a piece of Inuit art, such as a little animal carved out of stone.

Visitors enjoy rides and drive small cars. Ski Dubai is the first indoor ski area in the Middle East. Skiers enjoy slopes covered with man-made snow.
A small nation in the desert of the Arabian peninsula, the UAE is a booming country. Since the discovery of oil, the country has become rich. More people want to move there to work in this exciting industry. With so many people arriving, the culture has changed as well. Modern citizens are proud of their country’s success while still holding onto their Arabic past. The UAE will certainly continue to grow.",924.0
" Some may see the forest only as a source of wood, grass for cattle grazing, or a beautiful spot to pitch a tent—not as an ecosystem that sometimes needs to burn. Viewed that way, it seems only logical to put out forest fires. Yet not letting fires run their course can cause a problem for forests and people alike. Without fire, needles, brush, and logs build up over time. Once a fire does start, the built-up debris on the forest floor causes the fire to become more severe. Too much fuel can make a fire almost impossible to control.
Many severe forest fires have burned across the West in recent years. While other factors, such as climate change, have also played a role, most forest experts agree that these severe fires are caused by too much fuel on the ground—and stamping out so many wildfires is to blame. Fighting fires is also expensive. Since 1960, the annual cost to federal, state, and local governments to fight wildfires has grown from less than $100 million to more than $3.3 billion. This huge expense takes money away from programs that clear trees and brush in high-risk areas—programs that would prevent, or at least reduce, the scope and severity of fires.
When a wildfire burns, it’s hard to remember that something so destructive is also so productive. Yellowstone is living proof that it is. After the 1988 Yellowstone fire, dead gray stands of lodgepole pines covered the mountains for miles. Today, those trees’ seedlings form lush stands of young trees that grow taller every year. Someday, their offspring will do the same—thanks to fire. Wildfire serves a role in nature. People need to consider that role. In some cases, we might do well to stand back and let the fire do its work.",1013.0
" Jade is one of the most valued stones. It occurs in lavender, white, and almost every shade of green, which is the most valuable. Jade is very tough but easy to carve along its grain. Many civilizations, especially in Asia, used jade to make beautiful knives, swords, and axes.
Blue-green turquoise comes from the deserts of Iran, Tibet, and the southwestern United States. This stone often has pretty spots and streaks running through it. Much of the world’s turquoise is set in silver, as the Navajo Native Americans traditionally wore it. The Navajo believed turquoise to be pieces of the sky that had fallen to Earth.
Natural pearls are strangely shaped and are very rare. It takes an oyster many years to create a pearl from a tiny bit of sand. Almost all of the beautiful round pearls in jewelry stores are cultured, or made by people. Pearl farmers place a round shell bead into an oyster’s shell. The oyster covers the bead with nacre, creating a perfectly round pearl. Cultured pearls come in every color of the rainbow, from creamy white to pink to yellow to green and even black.
Beautiful gems can be found around the world. Many gems are symbols of power and wealth. For centuries, people have killed and died for them. In some places, such as West Africa and Colombia, the gem trade is still filled with blood and violence. Mining gems with dynamite and strip mines is often dangerous, damaging both humans and the Earth. Scientists can grow gems in the lab that are identical to the finest natural gems but cost a thousand times less. In the future, created gems might help fill our desire for gemstones’ beauty while preserving Earth and its people.",929.0
" Santa Anna knew Houston’s army was nearby, but he didn’t worry about it. He was sure the Texians wouldn’t even think of attacking him. Houston decided that the time for action had arrived. He ordered his army to make a surprise attack against Santa Anna. In the Battle of San Jacinto, the Texians defeated the Mexican army. Nearly every Mexican soldier was killed or taken prisoner.
Santa Anna escaped but was captured the next day. The Texians brought him to face General Houston. Santa Anna agreed to take his remaining men back to Mexico and to grant Texas its independence.
For nine years, Texas was an independent nation, the Republic of Texas, and Sam Houston served twice as its president. The republic, however, had many problems. It had little money, and it continued to have trouble with Mexico. Most people in Texas thought that Texas should be part of the United States. In 1845, the U.S. Congress voted to make Texas a member of the Union, and in December of that year, Texas became the 28th state of the United States.
For years after the 1836 battle, the Alamo lay in ruins. In 1846, after Texas became a state, the U.S. army began using the Alamo. It repaired the chapel walls and put a new roof on it, adding the now-familiar top to the chapel’s damaged facade. In the late 1800s, the army established a new post in San Antonio—Fort Sam Houston. The Alamo and surrounding grounds were later acquired by the state of Texas. For years, the Alamo has been maintained by the Daughters of the Republic of Texas. They preserve it as a historic shrine with landscaped gardens and a museum as a way to remember the brave men who lost their lives there.",891.0
" The park combines elements from the Edo period with modern museum exhibits, showing how they can blend together. The East Gardens are another beautiful public park, with serene ponds and grassy lawns. They also have many different trees and shrubs that provide colorful scenery in every season. The East Gardens are home to Japan’s last garden from the Edo period. Other sights from that period include guard houses, walls, and gates. Visitors can also see the imperial family’s art collection in the Museum of Imperial Collections in this area.
The Imperial Palace is still important in modern-day Japan, since the emperor performs many of his state duties there. It is also a destination for tourists and locals alike. This is especially true in the spring. In March and April, over one million people visit the cherry trees that bloom along one of the palace’s moats.
Because of the important role the palace plays in modern Japan, the government takes good care of it. About a thousand employees care for the palace grounds and create the schedules and events of the imperial family. The government spends billions of yen (millions of U.S. dollars) each year to keep the palace running. In 2016, the agency that manages the site spent about 5.5 billion yen ($48 million U.S.) on palace expenses.
The Imperial Palace in Tokyo offers a quiet spot in the heart of a busy modern city. It has rich forests, fine gardens, and peaceful ponds for visitors to enjoy. It preserves historic Japanese culture with its traditional architecture and landscaping as well as its centuries-old stone walls. The site is also important because it is home to the emperor and empress. For all of these reasons, the Imperial Palace is one of Japan’s beloved landmarks.",1026.0
" “Quick, Jacey!” Gamal urged. “I won’t have time to pull up.”
“Almost...” Jacey said quietly, concentrating on the target. The approaching ship was nearly on top of them. Jacey saw the burst of light as the ship fired. A split second later, Jacey fired a double shot, and in the same motion Gamal pulled them up and to the right to avoid enemy fire. “You got it!” Jacey heard as he saw the flare of exploding craft off to his left. “Great shot, Jacey!” Gamal howled with excitement. “Great piloting, Gamal!” Jacey cried. “Nice work, Gamma Team. Disengage and prepare to end your session,” commanded the control center. As the lights of BattleGlobe died down and Jacey and Gamal were lowered to the ground, Jacey heard the room explode with cheers and clapping. With that final shot, Jacey and Gamal had scored higher than any other team. They won BattleGlobe ! “Congratulations,” the commander said, smiling, as he walked down from the observation room. “You are the BattleGlobe champions. Jacey, great strategy; Gamal, great flying.” “Thank you, Sir,” they answered in unison, holding in their proud smiles.
After the commander shook their hands, Gamal looked over at Jacey. “I guess that was a good plan. You taught me a valuable lesson. I was trusting in my special abilities too much, and I was forgetting the most important rule: trust your copilot. Jacey Nova, I’ll fly with you anytime.” “Same goes for you, Gamal,” Jacey said. “With my strategy and your instincts, we’re unstoppable.” As the dynamic duo walked off together—surrounded by the claps and cheers of their fellow pilots—Jacey took one last look at BattleGlobe, now a quiet room again, and wondered how he could explain all of this to his friends and family back home.",646.0
" She says that being autistic helps her understand how animals think and behave. She also travels the world to talk about rights for autistic people. “If I could snap my fingers and be non-autistic, I would not,” she says. “Autism is part of who I am.”
When Noah Mundt was in seventh grade, his teacher enlisted a crew of three neurotypical boys. They became Noah’s friends and mentors. By hanging out with them, Noah picked up more about greeting people, getting along with others, and handling himself when he was upset. Noah’s buddies had a new friend and a greater understanding of the challenges he faced. Noah felt accepted in ways he never had before. “These boys dedicated time and energy in a genuine manner that turned out to be a win-win for them all,” Noah’s mom says. “Noah opened up to others as a result of their attention.” Sometimes autistic children must deal with teasing and bullying from people who don’t understand their struggles. Since autistic people don’t always recognize social cues, they can become confused and agitated when people are mean or ignore them. Often, those who do the teasing don’t understand the challenges that autistic people deal with all day, every day. Connecting with an autistic friend can change the way we see others, Noah’s mom says. “They may not understand the world around us like we do, but they feel the same emotions, perhaps more strongly than the rest of us.”
Science is only beginning to understand the complexities of autism. It’s an exciting field of research as society explores how families and communities can best support autistic people. In addition, more autistic people are sharing their personal needs, wants, and hopes. More than ever before, people are showing—and seeing—the many faces of autism.",1021.0
"” “Is he a good man?” inquired the girl anxiously. “He is a good Wizard. Whether he is a man or not I cannot tell, for I have never seen him.” “How can I get there?” asked Dorothy. “You must walk. It is a long journey, through a country that is sometimes pleasant and sometimes dark and terrible. However, I will use all the magic arts I know of to keep you from harm.” “Won’t you go with me?” pleaded the girl, who had begun to look upon the little old woman as her only friend.
“No, I cannot do that,” she replied, “but I will give you my kiss, and no one will dare injure a person who has been kissed by the Witch of the North.” She came close to Dorothy and kissed her gently on the forehead. Where her lips touched the girl they left a round, shining mark, as Dorothy found out soon after. “The road to the City of Emeralds is paved with yellow brick,” said the Witch, “so you cannot miss it. When you get to Oz do not be afraid of him, but tell your story and ask him to help you. Good-bye, my dear.” The three Munchkins bowed low to her and wished her a pleasant journey, after which they walked away through the trees. The Witch gave Dorothy a friendly little nod, whirled around on her left heel three times, and straightway disappeared, much to the surprise of little Toto, who barked after her loudly enough when she had gone, because he had been afraid even to growl while she stood by. But Dorothy, knowing her to be a witch, had expected her to disappear in just that way, and was not surprised in the least.",956.0
" After years of slavery, the whites looked upon labor and work as bad and inferior. Slavery took the spirit of self-reliance out of the white people. My old owner had many sons and daughters, but not one knew a single trade or work skill. The girls had never been taught to cook or sew or take care of the house. The sons had the feeling that manual labor was not the proper thing for them. On the other hand, the slaves had learned valuable skills, and none of them were ashamed to work. There are many instances of blacks caring for their former owners who became poor after the war. Not long ago, I met an ex-slave from Virginia. This man had made a deal with his master two or three years before the Emancipation Proclamation. The slave was permitted to buy freedom for himself by paying his master some money each year.
While he was paying for himself, he was allowed to work wherever he wanted, and he found a job in Ohio. When freedom came, he still owed his master three hundred dollars. Even though the Emancipation Proclamation said that no slave owed his master anything, this black man walked back to Virginia and placed every dollar in his master’s hand. He said that even though he knew he didn’t have to pay, he had given his word. He felt that he could not enjoy his freedom unless he kept his word. From some of the things I have said, you may get the idea that some of the slaves did not want freedom. This is not true. I have never seen a single one who did not want to be set free, or who would return to slavery.",992.0
" I raced into the dining room as Dad came in, grumbling about the darn snow and ice. “Oh, George, you complained about the traffic and terrible roads when we were back in Jamaica,” Mom reminded him. “Yes, but at least it was warmer there,” he laughed, and we nodded in agreement. As I placed the old, familiar plates and silverware on the table, I thought about the changes we each had to adjust to. Dad said his biggest difficulty was adjusting to driving in the snow. He admitted it was harder than getting used to driving on the right-hand side of the road. In Jamaica, we drive on the left-hand side of the road. Last week, he crashed into the garage door after hitting a patch of ice in our driveway. Mom’s biggest adjustment was that she no longer went out to work. She had set up her office at home and corresponded with her clients in Jamaica over the Internet. And my biggest challenge was getting used to the new school system.
All of us had left behind friends and family. But when we sat down to dinner and talked about our day, we always spoke in “ patois,” the Jamaican dialect. It felt good to hear and use familiar words and phrases. And even though our accents were much more pronounced, no one laughed or asked us to repeat ourselves. We could relax and be ourselves in our warm, colorful house, listening to songs from back home and eating the food we grew up with. It was a very comforting feeling to know that although we were thousands of miles from home, no matter what changes we faced in the future, we still had our culture to support us.",974.0
"” “They know nothing of loss!” the Queen screams, suddenly furious. The crack in her facade is terrifying, though it only takes her a moment to compose herself again.
“Perhaps not presently, but they will if your schemes come to fruition,” Seth says quietly. “Happiness and sadness are opposite sides of the same coin—one doesn’t exist without the other.” Seth’s words click in my mind. “You can’t really know what happiness is unless you’ve experienced sadness, and vice versa,” I say, more to myself than the Queen. “It’s the same with all negative emotions.” “Haven’t they experienced enough fear, sadness, and pain?” the Queen asks, her face becoming the epitome of sympathy. “No,” I say, “because that’s all part of being alive. We experience fear, pain, and sadness so we can learn and grow to overcome those emotions and find happiness. If we’re happy all the time, there’s no reason to change and become better. The pain of losing her mother pushed Sarah to become strong and brave enough to face the Hollow. The fear and sadness we both felt kept us moving forward toward finding Anna and Jasper.”
Then a realization hits me like a punch in the chest: “The opposite is also true,” I say, looking at the Queen. “Someone who only feels sadness and can’t move beyond it is also stuck.” I glimpse a minute shift in the Queen’s face—my words have struck a chord—but then her skin becomes like polished stone. “Why have you stayed here all these years, manipulating people and these innocent cephaloids to do your will and changing this world into something it’s not?” I ask as she begins to walk away. “Since you have rejected my offer, I have no further need of you,” she says, sounding exhausted. “Be gone.”",979.0

The other turned savagely upon him. They had a rapid altercation, in which they fastened upon each other various strange epithets.
The youth at last interrupted them. “Did you ever think you might run yourself, Jim?” he asked. On concluding the sentence he laughed as if he had meant to aim a joke. The loud soldier also giggled. The tall private waved his hand. “Well,” said he profoundly, “I’ve thought it might get too hot for Jim Conklin in some of them scrimmages, and if a whole lot of boys started and run, why, I s’pose I’d start and run.

" When the foals are a few years old, they leave to join a new herd. By playing together, young male horses learn how to grow into stallions that can start their own herds. Young females leave their herds to become the mates of these new stallions.
Wild Horses by the Sea Wild horses mainly eat grass, but sometimes they also browse for leaves. One mare leads the herd to food, water, and shelter. The stallion follows behind to watch for danger. Each herd stays together to raise young horses and help the group.
In the West, people once depended on tame horses. After the West was settled, they began to think of wild horses as pests. Some of the wild horses were killed so cows and sheep would have more grass to eat. Others were gathered up and sold for meat.
In 1971, a law was passed to protect wild horses from harm by humans. That law is the Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act. (Burros are wild donkeys.) Since then, the number of free wild horses in the United States has grown twice as large. Now, thousands of wild horses roam free in ten western states.
Although wild horses in the United States are protected by law, herds can grow too quickly. So for now, hundreds of horses are caught and removed from the wild each year. Some of them are adopted by people who will take care of them. Horses that don’t find homes right away sometimes wait in fenced areas called corrals. Others go to live in wild horse sanctuaries where they still have wide spaces to roam.
Many people are working to make sure some wild horses can always run free. They are why beautiful herds can still thunder across the West—the land those herds call home.",864.0
" Carnivores often had razor-sharp teeth that helped them cut through meat. Some of their teeth were even strong enough to crush bone. Herbivores usually had sharp beaks that they used to gather plants. Some also had flat teeth to grind tougher plant materials, while others had sharper teeth for chopping their food. Still other dinosaurs had both flat and sharp teeth.
Paleontologists learn about dinosaur babies from fossil nests and eggs. Dinosaur eggs came in many different shapes and sizes, including small round eggs and large oval eggs. Some dinosaurs laid over twenty eggs at a time, while others laid only a few eggs. Similar to birds, some dinosaurs may have sat on their nests until their eggs hatched.
Paleontologists find fossils of plants, fish, insects, and other animals in the same rocks as dinosaur fossils. These fossils help them learn what Earth was like when dinosaurs lived here. More examples of these other types of fossils have been discovered than dinosaur fossils. These fossils are usually smaller and more complete than dinosaur fossils. Therefore, paleontologists can more easily tell the age of these other fossils. They are then able to use the other fossils to estimate the age of dinosaur fossils.
How Long Ago?
Paleontologists can perform tests to find out the age of fossils. Older fossils are found deeper in the ground than newer fossils. More recent fossils are found in rocks closer to the surface. The oldest dinosaurs lived around 230 million years ago. These dinosaurs were only the size of large dogs. It wasn’t until around 145 million years ago that giant dinosaurs roamed on Earth.
Paleontologists have many different ideas to explain how dinosaurs disappeared around 65 million years ago. Studying dinosaur fossils helps paleontologists look for clues to understand what happened.",877.0

The septic tank is buried underground in the yard near the home. Any waste from the home runs straight into the tank. Inside the tank, the solids drop to the bottom. The liquid runs out through underground pipes into the yard and spreads into the soil. The liquid is filtered as it moves through the soil, which pulls out harmful things before they reach drinking water. The septic tank collects all of the solid sludge, which builds up over time. When there is too much sludge in the tank, a septic business must pump it out.
Think these systems are yucky? Think again. The first sewerage systems were built thousands of years ago in places such as ancient Greece and Rome. These early systems sent human waste with harmful bacteria away from cities—and directly into nearby water. The water made people sick.
Even by the 1800s, large cities like New York still had a hard time with their waste. People’s homes had no toilets. Sometimes they just had a hole in the ground. Since there was no way to flush, human waste would pile up in the hole. Some people allowed their waste to spill over and wash into the streets. It would pile up where people walked and children played. The smell was awful.
Experts began to understand that streets flowing with waste were also making people sick. New York City began building sewerage systems so the waste would have somewhere to go. By 1914, it had nearly 850 miles (1,368 km) of sewer lines. Today in the United States, waste disappears down toilets and sinks as if by magic. Now you know how it really works, though. So the next time you flush, take a moment to thank your modern sewerage system!",874.0
" When a female wasp spies a tarantula, she stings it. The sting paralyzes the spider but doesn’t kill it. The wasp digs a hole, places the paralyzed spider in it, and lays an egg on it. When the egg hatches, the wasp larva makes a tiny hole in the spider’s body and crawls inside. Then the larva feeds on the spider.
Goliath spiders are loners. They only get together with other spiders during the mating season or when they’re guarding their young. Females are bigger than males and live much longer. Some females have survived more than twenty-five years in captivity. Like all spiders, these tarantulas molt as they outgrow their hard outer covering, which is called an exoskeleton. They leave their old skin behind as a new outer skin hardens underneath. Adult Goliaths molt once or twice a year. Spiderlings, or young spiders, molt more often.
After mating, a female Goliath lays about fifty eggs in a silk egg sac. She stores the sac in her burrow and guards the eggs until they hatch in about six to seven weeks. The little spiderlings stay under her watchful eye for a few weeks until after their first molt. Then they’re on their own for the rest of their lives.
Goliaths have been around for millions of years—and they haven’t changed much in all that time. Their sheer size has always fascinated people. We continue to learn more about these spiders, from how their venom works to why females live longer than males. Like all living things, these spiders play an important role in the habitats where they live. They help keep rodents, insects, and other prey species under control. They also provide food for other animals. The world just wouldn’t be as interesting without these hairy giants crawling through the forest.",877.0
" When they’re older, they also eat leftovers from adult meals.
Komodo dragons become adults at around age seven. Males can live to the age of sixty. Females may only live half as long. Scientists think they die younger because of the extra energy needed to build nests and lay and guard eggs.
Only 3,000 to 5,000 dragons are alive in the wild. Because females have much shorter lives, as few as 350 breeding females may still be alive. Dragons are considered “vulnerable,” which means they are at risk of becoming endangered. Dragons are losing their homes to people who clear wild land. Villagers may kill dragons that attack livestock. Poachers kill them or kidnap them for sale as pets. In some areas, Komodo dragons must compete with humans and wild dogs for enough food to eat. Scientists around the world are working to keep Komodo dragons from becoming extinct. Some scientists study dragons in Indonesia to understand their habits and needs. Conservation groups work with schools and communities to teach people how to help protect Komodo dragons. Since 1992, zoos in and outside of Indonesia have been successful in raising Komodo dragons. Many different zoos now work to help keep dragons alive.
Komodo dragons—the largest lizards in the world—are fierce creatures and clever hunters. They have a wealth of adaptations to help them survive. In addition to sharp teeth and claws, they have huge, strong bodies that can overpower almost any opponent. More than seventy zoos around the world have Komodo dragons. You may be lucky enough to see one of these amazing animals someday. If so, you may find yourself admiring the perfect design of these heavyweight wrestlers. You may also gaze in awe as you remember that dragons aren’t just in storybooks—they’re real!",921.0

Now, performers wear dazzling costumes. The set designs and performances are often amazing. In popular TV talent shows, contestants with an unusual style may not make it to the final round. Eurovision, however, accepts everyone. Some Eurovision winners will have successful careers. ABBA won the 1974 contest, and Celine Dion competed for Switzerland in 1988.
The winners are not always the most interesting acts. The Russian entry in 2012, Grannies from Buranovo, was the runner-up with the song “Party for Everybody.” The Grannies amused audiences with cute lyrics about how everyone, including dogs and cats, is happy.
The contest shows audiences the many cultures across Europe. These days, more than forty countries may enter Eurovision. It has an audience of at least two hundred million people worldwide. Europeans vote to support their favorites. A 2006 study by two London colleges found that countries close to one another like to vote for their neighbors. Scandinavians support each other, and Eastern Europeans usually vote for each other. The United Kingdom and Ireland always remember how many points they give each other.
Eurovision is run by a group of public broadcasters—the European Broadcasting Union (EBU). Member countries of the EBU can enter the contest. Some countries not in Europe are also members of the EBU. After the 1991 breakup of the Soviet Union, new Eastern European countries joined. Some countries that are not in the EBU, such as Morocco and Australia, have also been invited.

" Crowds gathered to hear the famed scientist speak. The inventor Thomas Edison offered him a high-paying job in his lab, but Carver didn’t want it. He wanted to help people more than he wanted to make money. He believed that ideas were free, so they should be freely given.
Carver spent forty-seven years helping poor farmers. There was a limit, though, to what one man and his science could do. He could not change the unfair conditions that kept many farmers in the South poor.
Many were sharecroppers who could not afford to buy land. Sharecroppers grew cotton on someone else’s land. Many of those who owned land in the South cheated their tenants by lending them money to buy supplies at high interest rates. The farmer’s share of the crop went to pay the landowner, so the farmer was left with nothing. Other farmers rented land. If a farmer worked hard to improve the land, the landowner could raise the rent. The farmer had to pay more or move.
Other scientists during Carver’s time invented ways to use oil to make fuel, fertilizers, and plastics. Carver realized that oil was a resource that would someday be used up. He experimented with fuel made from plants. He encouraged farmers to use natural fertilizers instead of expensive, unsafe chemicals that polluted the land and water. He taught recycling, telling his students, “Save everything. From what you have make what you want.”
George Washington Carver believed that people should treat each other with respect. He won the respect of a nation at a time when few black people got much respect at all. Carver also believed that people should respect and care for the Earth. If they did, nature would provide the things they needed. Many years later, we are discovering that he was right.",922.0
" He went 1,228 kilometers per hour (763.035 mph) in a jet car called the Thrust SSC. It went from a complete stop to 965.6 kph (600 mph) in 16 seconds.
Humans have always wanted to fly like birds. Over the centuries, inventors have tried many different ways to fly. The first airplanes used engines that drove propellers. About 40 years later, the jet engine was invented, and the speed of aircraft really increased. The speed record now for aircraft is 3,367 kilometers per hour (2,193 mph). Can you imagine flying all the way across the United States in one hour and 15 minutes? An average jet airliner now takes about five and a half hours to make the trip.
If you want to move really fast, become an astronaut. In order to escape the gravitational pull of the earth, rockets must go over 45,062 kilometers per hour (28,000 mph).
It is unlikely that, in the future, cheetahs will run faster or sailfish will swim faster. Nor is it likely that falcons will fly faster. Even humans are not likely to run much faster than they do now. But that won’t stop humans from finding other ways to go faster.
At one time, humans wanted to travel at the speed of sound. Eventually, we found ways to make planes that traveled faster than sound. Today, rockets blasting off for space travel several times greater than the speed of sound. No doubt, humans will continue to find ways to go faster over land and water and through the air. Humans probably will not be satisfied until we are traveling at the speed of light. At that speed, we could circle the globe more than seven times in a single second. It is hard to imagine moving at such an incredibly fast speed.",885.0
" Which ones were real, and which ones might be fakes?
In 1993, a man came to a famous art house with a painting called A Young Woman Seated at the Virginal. He wondered whether it was a real Vermeer, or whether perhaps the famous art forger Han Van Meegeren had painted it. The art house agreed to investigate the painting. Like Han, the experts from the art house studied the paints and brushes used by Vermeer in his other paintings. They used microscopes and X-rays to uncover brush strokes. But what they found most interesting of all was the small canvas on which the picture was painted. The coarse canvas was the same as the one used in Vermeer’s The Lacemaker. Do you think that A Young Woman Seated at the Virginal is a real Vermeer or a forgery?
When the experts were done with the techniques, they turned to the style of the painting. They compared the painting to other Vermeer paintings of girls playing musical instruments, and they compared the folds in the skirt and other details to Vermeer paintings, such as The Guitar Player. Then they cleaned the painting and found their answer in the cool lighting, the shadows, the wall, and the mood.
Famous forgeries like those painted by Van Meegeren changed the way art experts examine a painting. Experts have determined Vermeer painted about thirty-five known works of art. No one but Vermeer could have painted A Young Woman Seated at the Virginal. Johannes Vermeer used light brilliantly. His colors were soft and gentle, and he chose them to create a mood or show a moment in time. He enjoyed painting the people he saw around him every day. He was a genius at expressing their feelings.

The Google Gulp was a drink that was said to make the consumer smarter. Social media giant Twitter announced in 2013 that it would start charging users more if they used vowels in their tweets. It offered to include the vowels for an additional monthly fee. Twitter even posted on its blog that it was offering this to encourage more efficient communication. Even the idea for Pokémon Go began as an Internet hoax in 2014. Google Maps advertised a spoof tool that would find the world’s best Pokémon Master. They specifically requested one who can “navigate through tall grass to capture wild creatures.”

" With the New York Yankees, Babe helped his team capture four World Series titles. In twenty-two seasons, he broke every record for home runs. He also set attendance records never seen before in professional baseball. Jackie Robinson was a smart and fearless competitor with remarkable baseball skills. He was also an African American who played in the Negro Leagues. Branch Rickey, the general manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers, convinced Jackie to be the first player to join an all-white major league baseball team. On April 15, 1947, Jackie appeared with the Dodgers as the first African American player in the majors. He became a national hero.
Roberto Clemente was another baseball great. Born and raised in Puerto Rico, Roberto played for the Pittsburgh Pirates from 1955 to 1972. His famous home run in Game 7 of the 1971 World Series won the championship for the Pirates. Sadly, Roberto died in a plane crash on his way to help earthquake victims in Nicaragua. Derek Jeter, a former Yankee shortstop, is a modern baseball hero. Derek was a leader in scoring hits and runs in the American League and was a five-time World Series champion. When he retired from the game in October 2014, he said, “The thing that means the most to me is being remembered as a Yankee.”

Oren Lyons, who grew up on a reservation, was a goalkeeper for Syracuse University and an All-American athlete. However, it was after his sporting career that he went on to do his most important work. Oren is a great humanitarian who helps to lead organizations that represent people everywhere.
Many people have heard of Jim Brown, an American football legend who won many awards during his career. What most people don’t know is that Jim’s first love was lacrosse. He is considered by many to be America’s greatest lacrosse player ever. Jim believed the game was the best one for his great athletic talents, and over the years, he told people that lacrosse was his favorite sport. Jen Adams is an Australian who came to America and played college lacrosse. She broke many records and many people think she is the greatest female lacrosse player ever. She was fast on the field, a good sport, and a great teammate. Jen is a college lacrosse coach today, and as recently as 2009, she played for the Australian team at the Women’s Lacrosse World Cup.
More than ever in the long history of lacrosse, the game is catching fire—especially as a youth sport. The pace, excitement, and rich history of the game make it appealing to young athletes today. Some sports fans love the speed of hockey or the complicated teamwork and ball passing of soccer. Others love watching the acrobatic plays in basketball. In the future, fans may discover all of those things in the single spectacular sport of lacrosse.",979.0

The next struggle for blacks was for voting rights. In the South, some whites made it nearly impossible for many blacks to vote. In some places, they charged a special tax many poor people could not afford. Those who failed to pay the tax were not allowed to vote.
In Selma, Alabama, Martin led long lines of African Americans to the registration offices. He was arrested for his action and later released. Then the marchers started marching on the road from Selma to Montgomery. They wanted to present a complaint to the governor of Alabama, George C. Wallace. But he ordered the march stopped. The marchers continued and were stopped by state troopers who used tear gas and clubs to stop the marchers. The day is remembered as Bloody Sunday. Later, on August 6, 1965, with the support of President Johnson, the Voting Rights Act was passed in Washington, D.C. It was a great victory for all people.
In 1968, Martin planned a Poor People’s Campaign. The goal was to get better homes, schools, and jobs for poor people of all races and backgrounds. That spring, he went to help out on a strike held by the garbage collectors in Memphis, Tennessee. (During a strike, workers refuse to work until they win better wages or working conditions.) While in Memphis, Martin was killed by an assassin’s bullet. He died on April 4, 1968, at the age of thirty-nine.
The whole world mourned the death of this great man. Martin Luther King Jr. is remembered for making real the dream of equality. He is remembered as a man of peace and a champion of rights and freedom for people of every color.",912.0
" They have appeared on many television shows, been the subjects of many books, and even rocketed into space. Humans have used monkeys for medical research because of their similarity to humans. Many people object to using monkeys and other animals for research. But monkeys have allowed us to learn many things about new medicines without having to test them on humans.
In some cultures, monkey meat is considered a delicacy. Some people even eat monkey brains. Many monkeys have been captured and placed in zoos and display cages around the world. Modern zoos have undergone efforts to place monkeys in environments that are similar to their natural habitats.
Many people around the world keep monkeys as pets. Because they are so intelligent and can use objects, many monkeys have been trained to help people who cannot move. They help paralyzed people do their jobs, cook food, and even brush their teeth. Throughout the world, humans are threatening wild monkey populations by destroying their habitats. Hunters also threaten monkeys because many people like to eat monkey meat. Efforts are underway in many areas to help save monkey populations.
Monkeys are everywhere. You may see monkeys as characters in cartoons or actors in movies. You can see monkeys at almost every zoo. You may even meet someone who has a pet monkey or a helper monkey. It’s no wonder people love monkeys so much, because they are so much like humans. Monkeys are intelligent primates that have opposable thumbs and can use objects and even use “words.” But they are also very different from us. Unlike humans, monkeys come in many different species. In fact, there are more species of monkeys than any other primate. Monkeys are funny, smart, beautiful, and useful animals that we should protect and respect.",929.0
"5 mi) beneath the sea at the bottom of the North Atlantic Ocean. Scientists could finally find their answers about how the ship sank so quickly. Scientists sent robotic devices to explore and videotape the wreckage. The ship’s ghostly form appeared eerily on the video monitors, its front railing recognizable, even after seventy years below water.
Scientists confirmed that the ship had broken into two parts. But what about the hole made by the iceberg? Buried in the sand of the ocean floor, it could not be seen. Therefore, scientists had to rely on sonar— waves of sound that bounce off surfaces. The sound waves helped the scientists discover that the iceberg had not cut a huge gash in Titanic’s side, as first suspected. Instead, the iceberg had made several small holes which, when added together, equaled only about the same area as a doorway. In addition, the holes were higher up on the ship than people had thought. These smaller, higher holes caused the ship’s compartments to fill very quickly with water, which ultimately caused the ship to sink.
Because of the Titanic, many lessons were learned and new rules were applied to make ships safer. Today, a ship must have enough lifeboats for all its passengers, and lifeboat drills must be conducted so everyone knows what to do in case of an emergency. Ships must also keep their radios on 24 hours a day. And the International Ice Patrol, an organization that keeps track of the location of icebergs, was established. The Titanic was a grand ship, and her story is just as grand. The legacy of the Titanic lives on in the memories of the lives lost, the lessons learned by the tragedy, and the changes that such a tragedy brought to sea travel.",1112.0

When Yasser Arafat (YAH-sur AIR-uh-fat), head of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), won the Peace Prize in 1994, many were upset. Along with Israeli leaders Yitzhak Rabin (yits-HAHK ruh-BEEN) and Shimon Peres (shee-MOHN PAIR-iss), Arafat won for his work for peace in the Middle East. The PLO was considered by some to be terrorists, but the Nobel Committee wouldn’t change their minds. Others were angry when American Secretary of State Henry Kissinger won the prize in 1973. Kissinger worked to end the Vietnam War. However, he had also been involved in attacks on Vietnam and nearby countries that killed many people. Even President Obama’s Nobel Peace Prize in 2009 was questioned. The election of an African American president filled many with hope. Yet in 2009, he had just been elected, so it was not clear what he had done to earn the prize. The award even surprised the president himself.
The Nobel Foundation awards cash, a diploma, and a gold medal to each prizewinner. The cash amount changes based on whether it is given to one individual or shared among a group of people. In 2015, the amount of an individual prize was just under one million U.S. dollars. Then a big party is thrown in the Stockholm City Hall in Sweden. There are speeches, music, dancing, and a fancy dinner.
The Nobel Prize has had a very positive influence on the entire world. The awards show the work and dreams of great minds from around the globe. The money and fame allow these amazing people to keep working. The prizes honor freedom, peace, and the goal of improving life for everyone.",960.0

On most of Ma’s albums, he performs classical music, but he has performed in many other styles as well. He recorded his own versions of songs from Cole Porter’s 1930s Broadway musicals. Ma has also recorded John Williams’s themes to Star Wars, E.T., and Jurassic Park as well as several movie soundtracks of his own. He has recorded with bluegrass and jazz musicians and orchestras all over the world.
Because Ma’s blend of backgrounds has always been important to him and his music, he founded the Silk Road Ensemble in 1998. This group is made up of musicians and composers from twenty countries. They collaborate on music that draws from traditions all over the world. The Silk Road was a trade route that ran through Asia hundreds of years ago. It united people across the entire continent. Silk Road isn’t just a musical group. It’s also a nonprofit organization that uses music and art to connect people from different parts of the world. When Ma isn’t playing with the group, he helps plan its programs to teach and play music.
“I’m an Accident”
Many famous musicians credit hard work or natural talent for their success. Yo-Yo Ma says he has no idea why he became one of the world’s most popular musicians. “I’m an accident,” he once said. He claims his success is a combination of many things. His parents, teachers, sister, wife, and kids have all helped him. Living in Paris and New York and performing at a young age were all experiences that shaped him. If any one of those things had been different, he feels as though he might not have become a world-famous musician.

" The next year, Clinton announced that she was running for U.S. president in the 2008 election. Her chances seemed good to win the Democratic nomination. For months, she was in a close contest with Senator Barack Obama from Illinois. Obama narrowly beat her, then went on to win the presidency with Clinton’s support.
President Obama named Hillary Clinton to be his secretary of state. This is one of the most important positions in the U.S. government. As secretary of state, Clinton oversaw diplomatic relations between the United States and other countries. She was only the third woman ever to hold the position and traveled to meet leaders in 112 countries—more than any other U.S. secretary of state. She emphasized how the United States needed to use “smart power” and not only military force to achieve its goals in the world. Clinton left the position in 2013 after President Obama’s reelection. However, there was one more race she wanted to run.
In April 2015, Hillary Clinton announced that she was running for U.S. president in the 2016 election. She officially won the Democratic nomination in late July 2016. In November, Americans went to the polls to cast their votes for president. In the end Hillary Clinton lost to the Republican nominee, Donald Trump. Throughout her life, Hillary Clinton has overcome barriers that have blocked women. She became a lawyer at a time when few women had law careers. She was elected the first female senator from the state of New York and became only the third female secretary of state in the country’s history. She was the first woman ever to be a major party’s nominee for president. Though she lost the presidential election, her life and work set a strong example for the girls and women who follow.",971.0
"
A lunar eclipse is a phenomenon of haunting beauty. As a full moon passes through Earth’s shadow, it is illuminated only by rays of sunlight that are scattered through our planet’s atmosphere. This light has a reddish cast, so the Moon turns a deep red. A lunar eclipse is visible from the entire side of Earth experiencing night time and can last for more than 1½ hours.
There is no more spectacular sight on Earth than a total eclipse of the Sun. By a coincidence of nature, the Sun and Moon, as seen from Earth, have exactly the same diameter. Because of that, when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun, it perfectly blocks the Sun’s disk. The disk is then blocked for several minutes. During that time, the Sun’s corona—its outer glowing gases—becomes clearly visible. During a solar eclipse, only people in a fairly narrow path on the Earth can see a total eclipse. Most people see a partial eclipse, with part of the Sun’s disk still showing. But even with a total eclipse, people are advised to view the phenomenon with special protective glasses.
The movements of the Earth and Moon seem somehow exactly right. A day is just long enough to accomplish some work, have a relaxing evening, and then get enough sleep to start a new day. The length of one year also seems right. Who would want it to be half its length or twice as long? As for the Moon, its 29½-day cycle of phases is almost equal to a month. We mark our days, months, and years with the movements of our planet and our Moon. And sometimes the Sun and Moon provide us with rare, beautiful displays that we remember for the rest of our lives.",1001.0
" In 1881, Edison moved to New York City to help start the first electric power plant. Eventually, power plants in hundreds of communities were making it possible for people to switch from gas and oil lamps to electric lights.
In 1887, Edison moved into a larger lab in West Orange, New Jersey. Around that time, he was shown a machine that played multiple still images in very quick succession. The things in the images appeared to be moving! Edison requested that one of his workers, William Dickson, work on a machine that could record images and also a machine that could project them. Dickson and Edison would invent the Kinetograph, a motion picture camera, and the Kinetoscope, a projector that would allow one person to watch the movie through a peephole. Edison also tried to link sound with the images of this new invention. He found it too difficult to get the sound and pictures to match, so his films were silent.
Edison continued to pour ideas into his notebooks and work with his team to turn his ideas into reality. Some of his other inventions included machines for mining, improved batteries, and new uses for cement. Throughout his life, Edison obtained 1,093 patents, which was a record at the time. He continued to work until he was more than eighty years old. Thomas Edison died on October 18, 1931. President Herbert Hoover asked everyone in the country to turn out the lights for a short time to honor Edison. Sitting in the dark for a few moments, people could think about the great changes Thomas Edison had made in their lives. As Edison once said, “If we did all the things we are capable of doing, we would astound ourselves.”",1032.0
" One group wanted a strong central government and wanted Roman Catholicism to be the national religion. Another group wanted the states to have more power, and they wanted to be free to worship as they wished. At last in 1824, the groups reached a compromise, and Mexico became a republic. They formed a national government led by a two-house congress. A governor and a legislature led each state. The first president was Guadalupe (hwah-dah-LOO-peh) Victoria.
Celebration!
The Mexican people will never forget the people and events that led to their country’s independence. Mexican Independence Day is a huge celebration, or fiesta, every year throughout Mexico. Each year, the celebration begins on the night of September 15. People all over Mexico gather in town centers. In Mexico City, around half a million people crowd into the city square.
Everyone watches the clock. At exactly 11:00, the crowd quiets. Mexico’s president comes out of the palace onto the balcony. He wears a sash of red, white, and green, and carries a large Mexican flag. The president rings the same liberty bell that Hidalgo rang when he called the people to fight against the Spanish for their freedom. As Hidalgo did so many years ago, the president shouts, “Viva México!” and “Viva la independencia!” His voice booms through loudspeakers.
The crowd screams “Viva México!” and “Viva la independencia!” while they toss confetti and blow on their horns. Everyone sings Mexico’s national anthem. Red, white, and green fireworks light the sky. Similar ceremonies take place all over Mexico at the same time. The next day, September 16, is Independence Day. Mexicans celebrate with parades, feasts, rodeos, bullfights, and horseback riding competitions. Statues of Hidalgo are decorated with red, white, and green flowers. It’s a fine celebration in honor of Mexico’s long, hard, yet rewarding fight for independence.",903.0
" The earthquake caused a ring of tsunami waves to speed outward from the point of origin, crossing hundreds and even thousands of kilometers of open ocean to strike countries far away. More than 225,000 people in eleven countries bordering the Indian Ocean were killed by the resulting waves. Satellite data analyzed after the tragedy showed that the height of the tsunami wave in the deep ocean was only 60 centimeters (2 ft). When the waves reached the shallow waters near the beaches, however, they often grew to reach over 24 meters (78 ft) tall. As a result of the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami, many countries are now working together to create a tsunami warning system for that part of the world.
Like volcanoes, tsunamis are becoming easier to predict. They usually do not hit the shore until a few minutes to a few hours after the earthquake or volcano that causes them. Scientists have instruments that detect volcanoes and earthquakes. When a large eruption or earthquake happens, scientists have time to warn people that a tsunami may be coming. Unfortunately, the system cannot warn people in time to save their homes or belongings. But they do have time to save their lives, which is the most important thing.
Our quiet planet occasionally turns violent. During a large earthquake, the ground shakes, destroying homes and property. In an explosive volcanic eruption, liquid rock, poisonous gases, ash, and landslides can bury cities. And tsunamis can cost billions of dollars in damage along coastlines. Scientists are trying to learn as much as they can about these violent events. As they learn more, scientists can predict volcanoes, earthquakes, and tsunamis in order to save thousands of lives.",1097.0

When Lavinia laughed at my muddy skirt as I passed her in the hall, I thought of something to say all in a flash—and I only just stopped myself in time. You can’t sneer back at people like that—if you are a princess. But you have to bite your tongue to hold yourself in. I bit mine. It was a cold afternoon, Melchisedec. And it’s a cold night.” Quite suddenly she put her black head down in her arms, as she often did when she was alone. “Oh, Papa,” she whispered, “what a long time it seems since I was your ‘little missus’!” This was what happened that day on both sides of the wall.",647.0

The little girl, seeing she had lost one of her pretty shoes, grew angry, and said to the Witch, “Give me back my shoe!” “I will not,” retorted the Witch, “for it is now my shoe, and not yours.” “You are a wicked creature!” cried Dorothy. “You have no right to take my shoe from me.” “I shall keep it, just the same,” said the Witch, laughing at her, “and someday I shall get the other one from you, too.”
This made Dorothy so very angry that she picked up the bucket of water that stood near and dashed it over the Witch, wetting her from head to foot. Instantly the wicked woman gave a loud cry of fear, and then, as Dorothy looked at her in wonder, the Witch began to shrink and fall away. “See what you have done!” she screamed. “In a minute I shall melt away.” “I’m very sorry, indeed,” said Dorothy, who was truly frightened to see the Witch actually melting away like brown sugar before her very eyes. “Didn’t you know water would be the end of me?” asked the Witch, in a wailing, despairing voice. “Of course not,” answered Dorothy. “How should I?” “Well, in a few minutes I shall be all melted, and you will have the castle to yourself. I have been wicked in my day, but I never thought a little girl like you would ever be able to melt me and end my wicked deeds. Look out—here I go!”",946.0

“He rescued the greater part of the Jewish children of my generation in Czechoslovakia,” Gissing has said. “Very few of us met our parents again: They perished in concentration camps. Had we not been spirited away, we would have been murdered alongside them.” As many as 5,000 people are now descendants of the 669 children who rode Winton’s trains to safety in 1939. Although those children are now old, many still call themselves “Winton’s Children.” Winton’s work has earned him many honors from the governments of both Great Britain and the Czech Republic. In 2002, Winton was made a knight by Queen Elizabeth II. This award is given to people for acts of bravery, service, or success. In 2009, a trip repeated the journey that Winton’s Children made between Prague and London. The train followed the same path and marked the seventieth anniversary of Winton’s last train. On board were many of those Winton had saved. Winton greeted the group himself in London with open arms. The trip came a few months after he celebrated his 100th birthday.
After his secret came out, Winton spoke often about why he worked to save the Czech children. He claimed that he did nothing special or heroic. “I just saw what was going on and did what I could to help,” he once said. To thank Winton for his actions, some of the people he saved gave him a ring. It includes a line from a book of Jewish laws.

Lucinda had herded the sheep to the fence where the horse grazed. Alejandro felt comforted by the sight as he made his way toward the animals, but his heart still thundered in his chest. Placing the flower in his pouch and taking a deep breath, he lifted the bleating sheep and then himself over the fence. On the other side, looking back at the rocks that hid the puma and the orchids, he finally felt safe again. Alejandro climbed into the saddle and nudged his horse forward, but he couldn’t push the blooming pasture and the puma from his mind. They were wild, strong, and healthy. The estancia was no longer a place for wild things, but instead a land controlled, supervised, and managed. The fence had protected him just as it protected the sheep, but the fence was also the problem. It was keeping the sheep from the rich pastures beyond.
Alejandro imagined an estancia with no fences. Some of the sheep might fall victim to predators like the puma, but the flock as a whole would survive and grow stronger. Watching Lucinda herd the sheep toward the flock far in the distance, he realized that he could tell his mother that he had truly learned something today. Alejandro urged his horse into a gallop.

" Two years later, Leif’s father had died, and Leif was running the family farm. He had no thoughts of sailing again. His younger brother, Thorvald, asked to borrow Leif’s ship. He wanted to see for himself this land that Leif had discovered. Thorvald and a crew of thirty sailed along the Vinland coast for two years, exploring the new continent and using Leif’s former winter house as a base.
Their explorations in Vinland brought both discovery and sadness. Their arrival frightened members of the native tribes, who had never seen Europeans. Small fights broke out. Then, men from Thorvald’s crew killed several native fishermen without reason. A few days later, angry native men retaliated by attacking a group of Vikings. The surprised Vikings fought hard but were chased away. Thorvald was wounded by an arrow. He died of his wound, and his body was buried in Vinland. He became the first European known to have died and been buried in North America. His crew sailed home to Greenland, but other explorers sailed to Vinland over the next three years, including another of Leif’s brothers and his sister. Eventually, the Vikings decided that exploring this new land was not worth the trouble it caused, and they abandoned the outpost.
For about 275 years, the Vikings swept across Europe in wave after wave. They were hungry to fight and greedy for riches. They built trade stations along European rivers all the way to the Mediterranean Sea. Viking explorers and raiders even traveled to the Middle East and Asia.

" The ring of senators had become a ring of death. As Caesar whirled to face attack after attack, he suddenly saw Brutus and Decimus—his protégés, supporters, and dear friends—with daggers lifted in their hands. A great well of silence seemed to enclose him then. They, too? he thought with sudden clarity. Even Brutus? Decimus? This is betrayal. This is the end. And covering his face in his regal toga, Julius Caesar sank beneath dozens of dagger blows, collapsing on the Senate floor. He died there, bleeding from more than twenty wounds.
The conspirators drew back a little, breathing hard and awestruck by what they had just done. Caesar’s friend Mark Antony, who had heard rumors of the plot against Caesar, burst through the doors of the Senate House with a look of desperation, but too late—upon seeing Caesar on the floor, his face sank and became ashen with grief. He turned slowly and stumbled out in a quiet state of horror, back into the unsuspecting crowd, which awaited the return of its beloved leader.
Though Brutus, Decimus, Cassius, and the rest of the conspirators believed that they had freed Rome from a great tyrant, the liberation did not go according to plan. The Gallic legions, enraged at Caesar’s murder, rose up in revolt against the conspirators and their allies. The result was yet another civil war between a pro-Caesar faction led by Mark Antony and an anti-Caesar faction led by Brutus and the other conspirators. In the end, the conspirators were defeated, and Caesar’s adopted son Octavian became the first emperor of Rome. In assassinating Caesar, the conspirators did not save the Roman Republic; instead, they set in motion a chain of events that eventually spelled the death of the Republic and the birth of the Roman Empire.",1113.0

As he noted the vicious, wolflike temper of his comrades he had a sweet thought that if the enemy was about to swallow the regimental broom as a large prisoner, it could at least have the consolation of going down with bristles forward.
But the blows of the antagonist began to grow more weak. Fewer bullets ripped the air, and finally, when the men slackened to learn of the fight, they could see only dark, floating smoke. The regiment lay still and gazed. The pestering blur began to coil heavily away. The men saw a ground vacant of fighters. It would have been an empty stage if it were not for a few corpses that lay thrown and twisted into fantastic shapes upon the sward. At sight of this tableau, many of the men in blue sprang from behind their covers and made an ungainly dance of joy. Their eyes burned and a hoarse cheer of elation broke from their dry lips. It had begun to seem to them that events were trying to prove that they were impotent. These little battles had evidently endeavored to demonstrate that the men could not fight well. When on the verge of submission to these opinions, the small duel had showed them that the proportions were not impossible, and by it they had revenged themselves upon their misgivings and upon the foe.

" The rats are also taught to walk on a leash at the end of a long pole. Handlers use the pole when clearing areas with many trees and boulders or on paths that twist and turn.
After a total of nine months of training, the rats have to pass several tests. For each test, the rats must find every mine hidden in a large field. During these tests, even their human partners don’t know where the practice land mines are. Once the rats pass the tests, they are ready to start finding real land mines with their handlers.
Rats can safely walk on ground where there are land mines because they weigh much less than humans. They are too light to set off the weapons. No HeroRAT has ever been killed by a land mine. The rats work quickly, inspecting an entire field in an hour. When a HeroRAT finds a land mine, humans carefully remove it. Once the rats’ work is done and the land mines are removed, fields are safe. The land can be used for farming or building. Children can play there without fear.
Mozambique is not the only country working hard to get rid of land mines. These weapons are a problem in many places around the world. Other countries in Africa and Asia are also using HeroRATs to help remove land mines.

If you don’t want to race alone, you can team up with family members or friends to complete a mud run. Your team members might do a caterpillar crawl or a tunnel slither as a relay. Or you might work together as a team to help each other deal with an obstacle. For example, some races force teams to push and pull each other up and over a wall covered in slippery mud. Mud runs are challenging, and teamwork can help everyone have a good time.
You don’t have to be a professional athlete to race in a mud run. There is a race for every age and fitness level.
Some mud runs offer courses for children as young as three. The youngest children usually start the race first, followed by older children and then adults. The children’s races are shorter, but they have obstacles, mud, and lots of adventure, just like the adult courses. You might climb a kid-sized wall or wiggle through a kid-sized tunnel on your way to the finish. Whichever run you choose, you’re in for a good time! Children sometimes have so much fun on these courses that they run them two or three times.
You’re near the end of your first mud run. You’re running for the finish when— squelch —you step into a huge pool of wet, sticky mud. The mud sucks at your shoes and sticks to your clothes, but you power through it. You cross the finish line, and though you’re not wearing a costume today, you feel like a superhero.",872.0
" It doesn’t even look like my room anymore.
Today, Mom and Dad are coming home from the hospital with my new sister, and I’ve decided to tell them they should just take her back. I don’t want to share my mom and dad, to say nothing of sharing my room. Even Grandma can’t cheer me up. She’s waiting with me while Dad goes to pick up Mom and the baby from the hospital. I had cold cereal for breakfast this morning, and when Dad rushed out, he didn’t even say goodbye. I guess having a baby sister makes me invisible. Well, here they are. Dad is carrying a bundle of pink blankets. Is the baby inside there? Could she be so tiny?
Mom is right behind Dad, and she looks tired but she won’t stop smiling, like the time she got up really early on my birthday to put together my bike as a surprise. Okay, now Grandma is rushing outside. She hugs Mom and then pokes her head inside the pink blankets. “Oh, she’s beautiful!” Grandma tells Dad. I’m not going out there. I’m going to sit right here. The baby’s getting enough attention without getting mine, too.
Suddenly, Mom is hugging me tight and kissing the top of my head, and before I know it, Dad is putting the baby in my lap. And then the most amazing thing happens. My baby sister reaches out and grabs my finger—and she won’t let go! I think she realizes that I’m her big brother, and she likes me already.
Hey, maybe having a little sister won’t be so bad. She is kind of cute. I guess we can keep her. Besides, I’m beginning to realize that Mom and Dad have enough love to share with both me and my sister.",695.0

Some argue that Husky Breanna Stewart may be the greatest player in women’s college basketball history. From 2013 to 2016, her team won the title four years in a row. For each of those four years, she won the honor of Most Outstanding Player.
The most exciting stories that come out of March Madness are “Cinderella stories.” Cinderella teams are underdogs that aren’t given very good odds to win. The single-elimination format of March Madness, however, means that any team can claw its way to an exciting upset victory.
Finals Nobody gave Villanova much of a chance against Georgetown in the 1985 championship finals. Georgetown was the defending champion and was awarded the top rank that year. Villanova was ranked eighth, and many thought their only chance of winning was by a miracle. It turned out Villanova didn’t need a miracle. All they needed was to play the greatest game of their lives.
Villanova shocked Georgetown with their high field goal percentage (over 78 percent; 22 of 28 baskets). This led to Villanova winning their first national championship in men’s basketball with a score of 66-64.
In the 2016 opening round, the Michigan State Spartans were ranked second. The Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders were ranked fifteenth. Yet the Blue Raiders shocked March Madness fans by defeating and eliminating Michigan State 90-81. The Blue Raiders didn’t win the tournament, but they did bust a lot of people’s brackets in the first round!

In Mexico, scientists estimate that 80 to 120 jaguars live in the Northern Jaguar Reserve. It’s a tough, mountainous area about 150 miles (241 km) south of the U.S. border. Every now and then, a jaguar from that population in Mexico walks north into the United States. In some places, scientists have set up video cameras in the wild. When something moves nearby, the cameras start recording. Since video cameras captured El Jefe in 2015, other male jaguars in the mountains of Arizona have also been captured on camera.
Each time a jaguar appears in a photo or video, scientists take a close look at its spots. They want to see if the spots match those of other jaguars they’ve found. They also look at the shape of its skull and its size to help figure out whether it’s male or female.
So far, only males have been captured on camera. That may mean no female jaguars live in the United States—yet. It could also simply mean no females have walked in front of a camera. Either way, jaguar advocates hope that female jaguars will make their way into the United States and begin a family. Only then will jaguars be reestablished in the United States. Someday, there may even be enough jaguars in the United States that they are no longer considered endangered.
More to Come?
Not everyone likes large predators roaming wild, but few people can deny that jaguars are fascinating. The return of jaguars to the United States is exciting for people who love these big cats.

Almost completely untouched by humans, Shirakami-Sanchi has no trails or structures. Because of its steep slopes, no trees have been cut down. Wildlife within the area is protected, although hunters called Matagi are sometimes allowed to hunt bears as part of their religion. The forest is also home to the Japanese serow. This goatlike animal is only found here and in two other small areas in Japan. More than 2,100 insect species and 87 bird species live in the forests—including the black woodpecker, an endangered species in Japan.
Russia’s Western Caucasus region stretches about 1,062 square miles (2,750 sq km) from the Black Sea to the Caucasus Mountains. Protected within Caucasus State Biosphere Reserve and Sochi National Park, this area shows great diversity. Coniferous trees make up most of the forests. Different species, such as pine, cedar, fir, and spruce—as well as beech and oak (both deciduous)—grow in different areas and at different elevations.
A variety of endangered animals make their home in these forests. Some scientists think that a very small number of endangered snow leopards survive there. No sightings have been reported for years, but scientists still find signs of the large cats, such as paw prints and scat. The endangered wisent, or European bison, has also been returned to the forest. The last wild wisent was killed in the Western Caucasus in 1927. People set captive wisents free in the area in 1940.

" It may break into pieces as it collides with other icebergs or ice shelves. Finally, most will drift into warmer water and melt.
Today, the ice in the Arctic and Antarctic is shrinking because Earth is getting warmer. More icebergs are calving. In order to better understand this melting process, one team of scientists landed on an iceberg to study it. In February 2017, another team of scientists flying over Antarctica photographed a rift, or crack, in an ice shelf. An ice shelf is a large sheet of ice that is attached to land but sits in the water. That July, the cracked shelf broke off from the continent. It formed A68, an iceberg almost the size of the U.S. state of Delaware.
In the short term, calving of icebergs like A68 adds little to rising sea levels. That’s because most of the ice is already beneath the water when the iceberg breaks off. However, ice sheet calving speeds the movement of glaciers off the land, and glacier ice moving into the sea makes sea levels rise much more. This, in turn, floods coasts around the world. It’s one reason scientists study icebergs: to help predict future sea level rise and help humans plan for it.
Icebergs have troubled us since people first set sail through chilly waters, but our relationship with them has changed. Today, more people worry about what melting icebergs mean for coastal cities than for sailors at sea. We may come to rely on these giants of nature for fresh drinking water—or some other use we haven’t even dreamed of yet. As research continues, we may find that what we know about them today is really just the tip of the iceberg.",1030.0

The princess didn’t want the Minotaur to hurt Theseus. She asked the man who built the Labyrinth how Theseus could escape. She was told that she should give Theseus a ball of yarn to tie to a door. He was to unwind it as he made his way through the Labyrinth. She also gave Theseus a sword. After Theseus defeated the Minotaur, he followed the trail of yarn back out of the maze. The Minotaur myth was popular after the Greeks took over Crete. Just as Centaurs often symbolized the Persians, bulls often stood for Crete. Bulls were sacred to an important goddess in Crete. Some people think that Theseus beating the Minotaur stood for the Greeks taking over Crete.
The Minotaur was tiny compared to the giant Typhon (TY-fon). It was a monster with wings, snakes for legs, and one hundred heads—one human and the rest different creatures. Typhon stood for the harmful forces of nature.
Only Zeus, the king of the gods, could match Typhon. Their battle shook the whole world. Zeus set all one hundred of the monster’s heads on fire. He then locked Typhon away inside Earth. The ancient Greeks blamed Typhon for the strong winds that spread across land and sea during great storms. People were comforted by the idea that Zeus could defeat the natural forces of weather that Typhon represented.
The ancient Greeks did not tell stories about mythical creatures simply to entertain or scare people. These creatures and the myths about them had meanings that helped people understand the world around them at the time. While mythical creatures played important roles in ancient Greek culture, they are also popular today. Children and adults are still excited by their amazing stories.",821.0
" Without a dependable food source, fewer adult penguins survive, so fewer chicks survive. Penguins also get tangled in fishing nets and die. Conservation groups are working to convince large fishing companies to limit their fishing near penguin rookery sites during the breeding season.
Oil pollution is another threat to penguins’ safety. Because they spend so much of their time swimming in the water, penguins are at greater risk than most other birds of coming in contact with an oil spill. They can’t fly above a polluted area to see and avoid it. When oil from a spill coats birds’ feathers, it prevents their natural insulation from working properly, causing them to quickly get too cold. Penguins have a thick layer of fat beneath their skin that gives them extra protection against the cold. When penguins are rescued and cleaned, their fat layer helps them to survive more often than other birds. Still, many more penguins die than can be rescued and cleaned.
Global warming is creating new dangers for penguins. As the air and water in the Antarctic region warm up, the ice mass shrinks. Normally, algae build up on the ice in winter. When spring comes, the ice melts and krill eat the algae. Less ice means less algae and less food for krill. With less krill to eat, fewer Antarctic penguins survive. Scientists are also studying other ways that global warming is affecting penguins. They have seen the numbers of many penguin species drop by nearly half in the past fifty years. The effects of global warming are most easily seen in Polar Regions. Like polar bears in the northern hemisphere, penguins are messengers of a planet in trouble. Penguins, like all birds— and all wildlife—need our help to survive.",1032.0
" The ants that work inside the nest tend to be younger ants. All these ants are female, but only one can lay eggs: the queen. In other words, all the ants in a colony are related.
The queen is the leader of the colony, but she doesn’t control all the activity in it. The largest of all the ants in the colony, the queen is an egg-laying machine. Some queens can lay thousands of eggs every day, which translates to millions of ants in a queen’s lifetime. She needs so many offspring because most worker ants live only for an average of forty-five to sixty days. Most colonies have one queen. When other queen ants hatch, they fly out in search of a new location to start another colony. After they start laying eggs, they lose their wings. Queens can also live longer than most other insects—more than twenty-five years—but when they die, so does the colony.
Ants may be small, but they can do awesome things. Thousands or millions of ants working together can build bridges to cross a gap in their path. They can also shape themselves into rafts to float across rivers without drowning. Through teamwork, ants can overpower animals hundreds of times their own size for food.
While some types of ants can be trouble for humans, most ants are beneficial and support the environment in many ways. They spread seeds, protect crops by eating flies, caterpillars, and other pests, and improve the soil for plants by digging. Stop and watch a trail of ants, or better yet, follow them—just don’t step on their trail. Ants’ abilities are inspiring, and learning about them highlights how awesome they are.",921.0

At Easter celebrations in Russia, people share baked goods and paint hard-boiled eggs. There are also Muslim people in Russia, so Ramadan is another big holiday there. During Ramadan, most Muslims fast—do not eat or drink anything—in the hours between sunrise and sunset every day for a month. Other Russian holidays include Independence Day on June 12 and Victory Day on May 9. Victory Day celebrates the end of World War II.A Russian holiday called Maslenitsa (MOSS-leen-yit-sah) celebrates the end of winter. To celebrate Maslenitsa, people eat pancakes called blinis (BLEE-nees) with butter. People also take sleigh rides and have snowball fights as part of the fun.
Perhaps one of the most popular foods in Russia is a soup called borscht. Borscht is made with beets, cabbage, and other vegetables such as onions and carrots. The soup gets its red color from the beets. People also make a traditional drink called kvass. Kvass is a sour drink that is made from stale bread. Some people make a soup called okroshka with kvass.

Though cowboys became famous for their bravery, the need for cattle drives didn’t last long. The railroad expanded rapidly. Eventually, the trains came to Texas, Colorado, and other ranch states. Ranchers no longer needed to drive their cattle hundreds of miles to distant stations. After the invention of barbed wire, ranchers also began fencing in their land. Rounding up cows was no longer necessary. Even if the cowboys wanted to continue the cattle drives, the fences would block their way.
But the cowboy life was far from over. Just as real cowboys were finding themselves out of work, Buffalo Bill Cody began his Wild West show. Cowboys were hired to show their riding and roping skills to crowds across the United States and in Europe. Annie Oakley, one of the most famous cowgirls, was a star of the Wild West show. It was this show that really created the legend of the American cowboy. The show included plays and acts that portrayed cowboys as rough-and-tough gunslingers, even though few had carried guns in real life. They made cowboy fashion, including jeans, vests, hats, and boots, popular with people throughout the world.
Long after the American West became settled, Western movies exploded in popularity. During the 1950s and 1960s, cowboy movies, television shows, toys, and games were everywhere. The Lone Ranger and Bonanza became popular TV shows. Children played “Cowboys and Indians” in schoolyards, even though in the real West, Native Americans often were cowboys. Today, you can see cowboy boots and hats in Tokyo and Paris as well as Texas. The cowboy has become little more than an image used to sell jeans, trucks, and cigarettes. But that image wouldn’t exist without the hard work and bravery of the real cowboys of the North American West.",983.0
" By the fall of 1849, the trail was lined with possessions people had thrown away, dead oxen, and graves.
For those who made it to California, life did not get easier. The prospectors lived in mining camps made of tents and rough shelters. They ate poorly. They worked twelve hours a day shoveling gravel or breaking rocks with picks. Many fell ill, often due to poor sanitary conditions and diet, but they kept working. The next pan of gravel might be worth a fortune!
According to the Sacramento Bee, one in every five miners who came to California in 1849 was dead within six months. Even those who found gold often lost it to robbers, gambling, or paying high prices for everyday goods. Some early prospectors were successful. Once the placer gold was gone, though, most of the riches from gold went to large companies. They were able to mine with high-pressure jets of water or dig deep mines.
Entrepreneurs made a fortune by selling to the miners. Sam Brannan became one of the first millionaires in America. Levi Strauss made his fortune selling pants tough enough to handle the work—blue jeans. Women, especially, had many more opportunities in the West. They started businesses cooking, running boarding houses, and washing clothes for the prospectors.
The biggest winner was the United States. The gold rush brought about three hundred thousand people to California. The West was populated in a few years instead of decades. In 1850, California became a state. By 1863, the country began building the transcontinental railway, which would link East and West. Today, California has more people than any of the other forty-nine states. It has a huge economy—larger than that of most countries. Nearly two centuries after the gold rush, California still lives up to its nickname: the Golden State.",937.0

Over time, other companies began to use the Fabergé name to sell products such as perfume. In 2007, a company bought the name. They hired Carl Fabergé’s great-granddaughter Tatiana Fabergé to research the history of Fabergé. Another great-granddaughter, Sarah Fabergé, creates new egg designs.

" The trip is difficult and dangerous; about 250,000 wildebeests don’t survive. Along the way, lions, leopards, cheetahs, hyenas, and wild dogs follow the herds, hunting for easy prey. One of the most dangerous parts of the migration is crossing the Mara River. Rivers such as the Mara are also home to hippopotamuses. These animals may look harmless, but they actually cause more human deaths in Africa than lions do. They are aggressive, territorial animals whose huge teeth make them deadly.
Hippos stay in the water most of the time, but at night they emerge to feed on grass and other plants. Sometimes they eat crops, which causes conflict between the hippos and people. On Lake Nakuru in the Great Rift Valley, pink flamingos gather by the millions. These wading birds stick their heads into the water to feed on small plants and animals. Scientists are not sure why they often stand on one leg. Two of the most dangerous animals in Kenya are very small. The tsetse (TSEE-tsee) fly and the mosquito infest about one-third of the country.

" Not only does Earth’s atmosphere protect the planet, but the pull of the Moon’s gravity steers some meteoroids away from us.
Scientists say, however, that some 65 million years ago, one very large meteorite got through. At the time, Earth was home to many kinds of dinosaurs. After the large meteorite struck Earth, the dinosaurs vanished. Earth turned into a wasteland. Although scientists aren’t completely sure, they believe a massive meteorite or asteroid strike blasted the dinosaurs into extinction. Scientists say the impact threw huge amounts of dust, gas, and rock into the air. The blast changed Earth’s climate, killing almost everything.
Why do scientists say a meteorite was the cause? One possible answer comes from scientists who study layers of rock on Earth’s surface. They noticed that at the same time the dinosaurs disappeared, the amount of iridium (ih-RIH-dee- um) on the planet went up dramatically. Iridium is a metal that is rare on Earth but is common elsewhere in our solar system. The sudden increase of iridium in Earth’s rock layers made scientists suspect that a large meteorite slammed into Earth, bringing a huge amount of iridium with it.
Target Earth?
The chances of another giant meteorite coming our way are slim. In 1908, a meteorite blew apart over the Tunguska River in Siberia. The blast leveled 400 square miles (1,000 sq km) of forest. Had the meteorite struck a city, the destruction would have been massive. However, we shouldn’t worry too much. Scientists say chances are that a large meteorite will hit a major city only about once every 10,000 years.

Once again, Grandma showed me her wisdom, and the anger and anxiety were safe inside my journal and almost entirely out of my head. All I wanted to do next was make up with Grandma for my horrible behavior. After serious brainstorming, I decided my apology would be a celebration of her, as well as her love of quotes. I went online using my newly hooked-up computer and a search engine to find quotes featuring grandmothers, and then I made a collage using different-colored paper, paints, stickers, and glitter. Before she looked at my handmade card, Grandma whirled around her room, showing me her furniture arrangement and the bird’s nest outside her window in the longleaf pine.

Ares (AIR-eez), the god of war, was a son of Zeus and Hera. He was a fierce, strong warrior who wielded a gigantic spear. Ares loved the destruction and smells of war. Sometimes other gods and goddesses chose one side to support in battle, but not Ares. He didn’t care who was right or wrong; sometimes he even switched sides mid-battle! Ares loved fighting for its own sake.
Ares did not get along well with many of the other Olympians, most of whom hated his attitude and violence. He was often found with his sister Eris, the goddess of discord, who had the power to stir up war. He was also in love with Aphrodite, who loved the handsome god of war more than she loved her husband, Hephaestus.
Of all Zeus’ children, the goddess of wisdom had the strangest birth. Athena sprang from Zeus’ head, fully grown and dressed in golden armor! Athena became Zeus’ favorite child, the only one allowed to use all his weapons—even his thunderbolts and lightning.

Others protested when American Secretary of State Henry Kissinger was awarded the prize in 1973. Kissinger worked to end the war in Vietnam. However, he had also been involved in deadly attacks on Vietnam and nearby countries.
Even President Barack Obama’s Peace Prize in 2009 caused controversy. The election of an African American president filled many people in the world with hope. Yet in 2009, he hadn’t done much more than get elected. The announcement of Obama’s award surprised many, including the president himself.
The Nobel Foundation awards cash, a diploma, and a gold medal to all prizewinners. The amount of the prize depends on whether it is given to an individual or a group. In 2015, the amount of an individual prize was eight million Swedish kronor (just under one million U.S. dollars). If the prize is shared among two or more people, the award of eight million kronor is divided equally.
Then the guests are taken to the Nobel Banquet at the Stockholm City Hall. A big party with speeches, dancing, a concert, and a fancy dinner takes place there.
The Nobel Prize has had a major influence on the entire world. The awards show the work and dreams of great thinkers from around the globe. The fame and cash prizes allow these brilliant individuals to keep working. The prizes honor freedom, peace, and the commitment to improving humankind.",956.0
" The glaciers help provide freshwater for 1.5 billion people living in India, Pakistan, and six other Asian countries. In the past, the melting glaciers slowly released water into the rivers below. Now the glaciers are melting rapidly, and the long-term water supply is shrinking. At the same time, the increased melting has caused severe flooding along these rivers.
As climate change worsens, less water is available for ranching, growing crops, and producing energy. Nature and wildlife suffer. Arguments break out between cities, states, and even countries over who has a better right to the same source of water. For instance, Pakistan and India are in a race to build dams on the headwaters of the same river. Tensions between the two countries run high, and the growing water crisis hasn’t helped.
So what can we do?
Each person’s efforts to conserve water can help. States can conserve, too. In 2013, faced with California’s driest year on record, the governor called for people to use 20 percent less water.
Countries need to find solutions, too. Workers in Saudi Arabia are converting salt water to freshwater in a process called desalination. The process is expensive, though, and many countries cannot afford to build desalination plants.
The island of Singapore has experimented with cleaning wastewater that comes from washing dishes, flushing toilets, and taking baths and showers. Some other countries do this, too, but Singapore obtains one-third of its water this way.
While cities are growing rapidly, agriculture uses about 70 percent of the world’s water. Some farmers and ranchers are trying to use water in more efficient ways. The water saved could go to cities instead.
Solving the planet’s water problem is hard. Still, we all need to find ways to conserve this valuable resource, not just for our generation, but for the ones yet to come.",992.0
" Her papa loved it, and she loved it because he did. Her dear mama, who had died when she was born, had been French. She would be glad to learn anything monsieur would teach her, but what she had tried to explain to madame was that she already knew the words in this book—and she held out the little book of phrases. When she began to speak Miss Minchin started quite violently and sat staring at her over her eyeglasses, almost indignantly, until she had finished. Monsieur Dufarge began to smile, and his smile was one of great pleasure. To hear this pretty childish voice speaking his own language so simply and charmingly made him feel almost as if he were in his native land—which in dark, foggy days in London sometimes seemed worlds away. When she had finished, he took the phrase book from her, with a look almost affectionate. But he spoke to Miss Minchin.
“Ah, madame,” he said, “there is not much I can teach her. She has not learned French; she is French. Her accent is exquisite.” “You ought to have told me,” exclaimed Miss Minchin, much mortified, turning to Sara. “I—I tried,” said Sara. “I—I suppose I did not begin right.” Miss Minchin knew she had tried, and that it had not been her fault that she was not allowed to explain. And when she saw that the pupils had been listening and that Lavinia and Jessie were giggling behind their French grammars, she felt infuriated. “Silence, young ladies!” she said severely, rapping upon the desk. “Silence at once!” And she began from that minute to feel rather a grudge against her show pupil.",972.0
" She was, indeed, greatly embarrassed. “I—I scarcely ever see him,” she stammered. “He is always in the library—reading things.” “I love mine more than all the world ten times over,” Sara said. “That is what my pain is. He has gone away.” She put her head quietly down on her little, huddled-up knees, and sat very still for a few minutes. “She’s going to cry out loud,” thought Ermengarde, fearfully. But she did not. Her short, black locks tumbled about her ears, and she sat still. Then she spoke without lifting her head.
“I promised him I would bear it,” she said. “And I will. You have to bear things. Think what soldiers bear! Papa is a soldier. If there was a war he would have to bear marching and thirstiness and, perhaps, deep wounds. And he would never say a word—not one word.” Ermengarde could only gaze at her. Sara was so wonderful and different from anyone else. Presently, Sara lifted her face and shook back her black locks, with a queer little smile. “If I go on talking and talking,” she said, “and telling you things about pretending, I shall bear it better. You don’t forget, but you bear it better.” Ermengarde did not know why a lump came into her throat and her eyes felt as if tears were in them. “Lavinia and Jessie are ‘best friends,’” she said rather huskily. “I wish we could be ‘best friends.’ Would you have me for yours? You’re clever, and I’m the stupidest child in the school, but I—oh, I do so like you!” “I’m glad of that,” said Sara. “Yes. We will be friends. And I’ll tell you what”—a sudden gleam lighting her face—“I can help you with your French lessons.”",571.0
" “Sara,” she said, “do you think you can bear living here?” Sara looked round also. “If I pretend it’s quite different, I can,” she answered; “or if I pretend it is a place in a story.” She spoke slowly. Her imagination was beginning to work for her. It had not worked for her at all since her troubles had come upon her. She had felt as if it had been stunned. “Other people have lived in worse places. Think of the Count of Monte Cristo in the dungeons of the Chateau d’If. And think of the people in the Bastille!”
“The Bastille,” half whispered Ermengarde, watching her. She remembered stories of the French Revolution which Sara had been able to fix in her mind by her dramatic relation of them. No one but Sara could have done it. A well-known glow came into Sara’s eyes. “Yes,” she said, hugging her knees, “that will be a good place to pretend about. I am a prisoner in the Bastille. I have been here for years and years; and everybody has forgotten about me. Miss Minchin is the jailer—and Becky”—a sudden light adding itself to the glow in her eyes—“Becky is the prisoner in the next cell.” She turned to Ermengarde, looking quite like the old Sara. “I shall pretend that,” she said; “and it will be a great comfort.” Ermengarde was at once enraptured and awed. “And will you tell me all about it?” she said. “May I creep up here at night and hear the things you have made up in the day? It will seem as if we were more ‘best friends’ than ever.” “Yes,” answered Sara, nodding. “Adversity tries people, and mine has tried you and proved how nice you are.”",647.0
" Alexander was now considered king of Persia. Far from his home in Macedonia, Alexander started transforming his lifestyle to include Persian customs. He married two local princesses and began to expect Macedonians to honor him with low bows, as Persians did. Many Macedonians did not like Alexander’s new behavior.
His army was exhausted, but Alexander managed to convince them to move farther east to what he knew as India (Pakistan and Afghanistan today). In 326, Alexander fought Porus, a leader who resisted him. Alexander met Porus’s troops at the Hydaspes (hy-DAS-peez) River. Soldiers of this area used elephants in battle. Porus’s elephants, having done some damage to the Greeks, eventually panicked due to the intensity of the fight and retreated. Porus surrendered to Alexander. It was Alexander’s last big battle. There was great unrest among his soldiers. Unable to convince them to go any farther, he agreed to turn back. He made it to Babylon, where he came down with a fever in the spring of 323. He died there in June of that year.
Alexander was undoubtedly a powerful man and an exceptional leader. His empire included parts of Europe, Asia, and Africa. By today’s thinking, Alexander was brutal. The number of people killed under his rule was close to 750,000. However, Alexander’s conquests were not just about controlling people and land. He explored the history and customs of all the places he traveled. Alexander became a model for generations of leaders who followed. He opened doors of knowledge about the places he traveled and learned about new religions and governments. He also opened the eyes of the people he met to Greek ways and created a world that was more open to trading new materials and new ideas.",913.0
" Bennett worked to change farming methods in order to help stop blowing dirt in its tracks. He worked to convince Congress to pass the Soil Conservation Act of 1935.
Roosevelt also provided other programs to help the weary farmer. Some of these programs were:
The act set aside $200 million to help farmers who could not make payments on their farms to refinance their bank loans.
The government bought cattle from farmers to prevent farmers from becoming bankrupt. The government paid them more than they could have received from selling on the regular market.
This service developed programs to stop soil erosion and paid farmers to use soil-conserving methods to farm.
This project paid farmers to plant trees all across the Great Plains. Trees planted along fencerows would stop wind from carrying away soil.
In addition to these programs, the New Deal offered many programs aimed at creating jobs for all those who were out of work. The largest of these programs was known as the Works Progress Administration (WPA). The WPA employed millions after it was created in 1935.
As the Dirty Thirties drew to a close, rain clouds began to replace dust clouds. The drought was finally over for much of the Great Plains and the Canadian Prairie in the early 1940s. Farmers went back to planting wheat. Familiar golden fields waved across the plains once again; however, farming methods had changed and thousands of acres of grasslands had been set aside by governments to try to prevent another Dust Bowl. By 1939, World War II had started in Europe, and by 1941, North America was in the war. With the coming of the war, much of the world pulled out of the Great Depression. The two clouds of the Dirty Thirties had lifted.",1037.0
" Below the spongy bone and also within it is the bone marrow. Bone marrow is important because it is the place where the body makes blood cells. The bone marrow in a typical adult produces over 50 billion red blood cells every day!
Even though bones are very strong, they can break if they are struck with enough force. Healing a broken bone requires a little help from a doctor and a great deal of help from bone cells. For a bone to heal properly, the bone must be put back together exactly the way it was before the break. Depending on the severity of the break, doctors may need to move around the broken bones to put them back in position. Then they place a cast around the body part where the bone was broken. The cast prevents the body part from moving so the bone has time to heal. As soon as a bone breaks, bone cells immediately begin repairing it. Holding the broken bone in place with a cast allows the bone cells to do their job.
Bones need to stay healthy to remain strong. Exercising regularly is the best way to keep your bones in good working order. Eating a well-balanced diet helps the bone marrow to produce healthy blood cells. Legumes (such as pinto beans or peas), other vegetables, and fruits are good for your bones. Foods rich in calcium, such as dairy products and fortified soy milk, rice milk, and orange juice, can also help bones to grow. Your bones give your body its shape, and they also give you much more. They give you the ability to move, sit, stand, and write. You wouldn’t be you without your bones!",946.0
" They especially honor the memory of Genghis Khan, who is a national hero. Most other people in the world look back with horror on the period of the Mongol invasions. It was a time of unbelievable bloodshed and destruction. Historians estimate the number of people killed by the Mongols ranges from 60 million to 150 million. Some historians claim that such numbers are ridiculous. They say the Mongols couldn’t possibly have killed that many people, and perhaps they’re right. Even World War II, the largest war ever fought, didn’t cause that many deaths. We will never know what the true number was as detailed records were not kept, but the number was well into the millions.
During the 2000s, archaeologists have been searching for the burial place of Genghis Khan. In 2001 and 2004, groups of archaeologists announced that they had made important finds of Mongolian ruins and tombs. As of yet, the remains of Genghis Khan had still not been located. Some historians also argue that the Mongol Empire brought benefits to the world. They point out that the empire, once established, brought peace across Asia and the Middle East. Indeed, this period in history is called the Mongol Peace. The Mongol Peace made it possible for travelers to cross all of Asia and the Middle East in safety. The Mongols encouraged trade, helping people not only in Europe, but also in isolated areas to learn more about one another. According to at least one historian, the Mongol Peace actually set the stage for the Renaissance, the rebirth of culture and learning that began in Italy in the 1300s. So, should the world be thankful for the Mongol invasions? One can guess what the victims of Genghis Khan’s Mongols would have thought about that question.",1032.0
" After a few minutes, he stops short in front of a door that looks completely out of place. It is white, with four panels and a knob—the kind of door you’d see in any modern house. “In there,” Thomas says, almost fearfully. Uncle Jasper hesitantly reaches for the knob, holding me back with his other hand. A gust of fresh air hits us as we look inside to see a room about the size of my bedroom at home. A crib sits in one corner and a bed in the other. The place looks neglected: cracked walls with peeling wallpaper that once held bright balloons, tattered bedding, and a worn floor with piles of sand in the corner. In the center of the room, a woman sits in a creaking rocking chair, holding a bundle of blankets. The woman coos and sings a sweet song. She pulls her black hair streaked with gray away from her face, and Uncle Jasper gasps, “Anna.” “She can’t hear you,” Thomas explains. “She’s so lost in the illusion that it’s become her reality. We’re like ghosts to her.”“She looks so happy,” Uncle Jasper says. “She would. To her, everything here seems perfect and wonderful.”
“What’s she holding?” I ask. “In her mind, it’s baby Sarah in all her wiggling pink cuteness,” Thomas says. “Why don’t we see a baby?” “Because she’s so far into the illusion that Mother only has to keep a modicum of maintenance to satisfy her. Often, people see what they want to see to keep from facing the truth. It’s easier to stay in a world of fantasy than deal with the pain of reality.” “What do we do now?” I ask. “How do we snap her out of it?” “I know a way,” Uncle Jasper says.",720.0
" In the distance, he could see the large oval of the Olympic stadium, and even farther away, the glistening sea. As the Sun turned orange and began to drop below the horizon, Brady’s thoughts wandered back over all he’d seen. “You know, Dimitri,” Brady said, while focusing on the brilliant sunset spilling out before him, “you’re right, I need to pay more attention to the details of life. I would’ve missed so many of these amazing sights if I were here by myself. Thank you for opening my eyes about these places. Now will you please tell me how my father saved your life?” “You don’t need to thank me, my friend,” Dimitri answered, putting a hand on Brady’s shoulder and joining him in admiring the sunset. “Nothing in life pleases me more than seeing friends truly appreciate the wonders of life.” Dimitri stood silently for an extended moment before continuing:
“Now I’ll explain how your father’s a hero.” “My father was a hero?” asked Brady, shocked. “Your father and I were traveling in Spain when we decided to take part in the Running of the Bulls, a Spanish tradition in which regular people carouse with hundreds of wild bulls. What an exciting time! But while running, I took my eyes off the bulls and would have been stampeded to death except that your father pushed me out of the way at the last instant. That’s why I said it’s important to see things from a certain viewpoint, and that’s also why your father and I say it’s important to keep your eyes open.” “Wow, I never knew my father had that in him,” Brady replied. In the fading light, Brady thought about how he’d leave Greece a different person than when he arrived.",1071.0
" Elizabeth’s troops had triumphed, and she had survived another challenge to her crown.
Elizabeth had developed a strong government and a powerful navy. Wanting to bring expansion and wealth to her beloved country, she encouraged exploration of new places and trade with foreign countries. Trade of such goods as silk, food, and spices, greatly helped England’s economy. Elizabeth believed strongly in supporting the arts. During her reign, she encouraged growth in the areas of music, art, and literature. Musicians, poets, writers, and other artists were always welcome in her court. By 1590, the arts in England were flourishing. William Shakespeare, arguably the greatest playwright of all time, became very popular during Elizabeth’s reign and often brought his troupe of actors to perform in her court. England was set to become a global empire and the Elizabethan Age came to be known as the “Golden Age” in English history. As a result, England became one of the most important countries in the world.
During her rule, Elizabeth eased the religious arguments that had torn apart her country. Protestantism was quietly established as the official religion of England. Great strides were made in education and the arts, which she firmly supported. Additionally, more people than ever before learned to read and write. When Elizabeth died in 1603, she had reigned for forty-four years. She had named James VI, the son of Mary, Queen of Scots as her successor—bringing together England and Scotland. Elizabeth was highly educated and a keen observer of human nature. During her reign, she proved to her allies and enemies alike that a woman could be an effective and successful monarch and ruler. As a result, the English loved and respected her. They would forever remember their queen.",990.0
" This is the origin of volcanoes. Maui’s brothers, left behind in their canoe, decided that they wanted to take some of the marvelous island Maui had pulled out of the sea away with them to show their families. So they carved out huge chunks of the island and loaded them into the canoe. The gouges they made in the island remain, even now. This is the reason for the mountains and valleys we see today on Aotearoa, the islands of New Zealand. That is how the hero Maui lifted the Pacific Islands out of the sea.
Maui gave humankind many gifts, but there was one boon he was not able to grant humankind: the gift of immortality. Maui believed that it was not right that the people of Polynesia should die. He wished for humanity to live forever, as the gods did. He decided to attempt to steal the secret of immortality from Hine (HEE-nay). She was a goddess who kept the secret to immortal life in her heart. Maui knew that the only way to steal the secret was to steal Hine’s heart. Gathering his courage, Maui approached Hine stealthily while she was sleeping. He dived into her open mouth with his spear in his hand. He found Hine’s heart and nearly escaped with it—but Hine woke just as he was trying to come out of her mouth again. Realizing something was amiss, she caught Maui between her teeth and killed him. Maui was not successful in giving humanity the gift of eternal life, but humanity remembers him and honors him for the attempt. The stories of Maui’s exploits are among the best-loved legends of Polynesia. In this way, the hero Maui survives as the stories about him are passed down from generation to generation.",993.0
" But the Rat kindly looked in another direction, and presently the Mole’s spirits revived again, and he was even able to give some straight backtalk to a couple of moorhens who were sniggering to each other about his bedraggled appearance. When they got home, the Rat made a bright fire in the parlour and planted the Mole in an armchair in front of it, having fetched down a dressing gown and slippers for him, and told him river stories till suppertime. Very thrilling stories they were, too, to an earth-dwelling animal like Mole. Stories about weirs, and sudden floods, and leaping pike, and steamers that flung hard bottles—at least bottles were certainly flung, and from steamers, so presumably by them; and about herons, and how particular they were whom they spoke to; and about adventures down drains, and night fishings with Otter, or excursions far afield with Badger. Supper was a most cheerful meal; but very shortly afterwards a terribly sleepy Mole had to be escorted upstairs by his considerate host to the best bedroom, where he soon laid his head on his pillow in great peace and contentment, knowing that his newfound friend the River was lapping the sill of his window.
This day was only the first of many similar ones for the emancipated Mole, each of them longer and full of interest as the ripening summer moved onward. He learnt to swim and to row, and entered into the joy of running water; and with his ear to the reed-stems he caught, at intervals, something of what the wind went whispering so constantly among them.",1603.0
" He could hear them close behind him now. Ceasing to heed where he was going, he struggled on blindly and wildly, looking back over his shoulder at the now triumphant enemy, when suddenly the earth failed under his feet, he grasped at the air, and, splash! he found himself head over ears in deep water, rapid water, water that bore him along with a force he could not contend with; and he knew that in his blind panic he had run straight into the river! He rose to the surface and tried to grasp the reeds and the rushes that grew along the water’s edge close under the bank, but the stream was so strong that it tore them out of his hands. “O my!” gasped poor Toad, “if ever I steal a motorcar again! If ever I sing another conceited song” —then down he went, and came up breathless and spluttering. Presently he saw that he was approaching a big, dark hole in the bank, just above his head, and as the stream bore him past, he reached up with a paw and caught hold of the edge and held on. Then slowly and with difficulty he drew himself up out of the water, till at last he was able to rest his elbows on the edge of the hole. There he remained for some minutes, puffing and panting, for he was quite exhausted.
As he sighed and blew and stared before him into the dark hole, some bright small thing shone and twinkled in its depths, moving towards him. As it approached, a face grew up gradually around it, and it was a familiar face! Brown and small, with whiskers. Grave and round, with neat ears and silky hair. It was the Water Rat!",1073.0
" As long as the team gains at least 10 yards within those four downs, it keeps the ball. Then it earns the chance to gain another 10 yards. But let’s say the offensive team can’t move the ball 10 yards within the four downs. Then the other team gets the ball.
Teams have many special plays, or plans of action, for moving the ball down the field. The quarterback tells his or her teammates which play to use each time the teams line up.The defensive team has several ways to try to stop the offensive team from scoring. Defensive players try to knock down the ball carrier, which is called tackling. They can also get the carrier to drop the ball, or they can catch a ball meant for a player on the other team.
Two of the greatest players in American football history were Jerry Rice and Joe Montana. They played for the San Francisco 49ers in the 1980s. Rice was the best wide receiver in football history. Montana was probably the best quarterback ever. Together they led the 49ers to three Super Bowl wins.
Tackle football is still very popular among players of all ages. However, some forms of the game are just as fun and not as hard on the body as tackle football. In touch football, players only need to touch the ball carrier to stop him or her. They may or may not follow the main rules of tackle (NFL) football. Flag football is another form of the game. Players stop a ball carrier by grabbing a piece of cloth attached to his or her waist. Whatever form of football fans play or watch, they are sure to have a great time with this amazing sport.",808.0
" Closed landfills can be turned into parks, playgrounds, or open areas. Even after they’re capped, though, landfills cannot be forgotten. A 2008 study found that 82 percent of the landfills studied were leaking. “No liner can keep all liquids out of the ground for all time. Eventually liners will either degrade, tear, or crack,” reports the Environmental Protection Agency. When that happens, toxic liquids will escape and pollute the soil and groundwater.
The United States may have a lot of land, but that doesn’t mean it’s easy to find space to build new landfills. People often don’t want one in their neighborhood because they worry about the noise, pests, and pollution. Some states actually ship their trash across state lines to get rid of it. The number of U.S. landfills is dropping. The country had 6,300 open landfills in 1990. By 2011, it had only 2,300 open landfills. The new landfills are bigger and better, but the trash has to travel farther to reach them. The United States burns more fossil fuels each year in order to lay the trash to rest.
We don’t know how long it will take our trash to break down or how long the landfill liners will last. What we do know is that each of us has a choice about what we do with our garbage. About half the things we throw away could be recycled and kept out of landfills. We can also reduce the amount of garbage we’re creating each day by buying less in the first place. We may not throw trash on our floors anymore, but that doesn’t mean the things we throw away go away. What will people in the future say about the trash we leave behind?",848.0
" At the time, Petra was a trade center. Because it was built in a desert, it had a complex system for moving water that used pipes, reservoirs, and waterways.
Archaeologists think an earthquake destroyed the water system, forcing people to leave. The discovery of new trade routes away from Petra may also have contributed to people leaving the city. Petra was known to the local people but wasn’t visited by people from outside until 1812. Only a small part of the city has been uncovered. Most of Petra is still hidden underground.
The Iliad, an ancient Greek poem written by Homer, tells the story of the Trojan War. In the poem, the great city of Troy was under siege by the Greeks for ten years. People had searched for the city for hundreds of years but never found it. Scholars thought Troy only existed in stories. Then, in 1871, an excavation in Turkey found the remains of a city matching the description of Troy. As archaeologists dug deeper, they found nine cities built one on top of another.
The first city of Troy was built around 3000. Modern excavations have found huge walls like those described in the Iliad. Most archaeologists agree that this is ancient Troy. However, they still debate which layer is the city described in the ancient poem.
Archaeologists and others have found many lost cities over the years, but others may remain hidden. Many countries around the world have their own stories about cities that have disappeared for one reason or another. The most famous of all, however, is still Atlantis. The search for the legendary city continues. It very well could be a story invented by a poet, but who knows? That’s what they said about Troy . . .",915.0

The 9th and 10th Cavalries were ordered to stop Apache attacks. The 10th Cavalry remained in the Southwest for years, trying to bring the Apaches under control. By contrast, the 9th Cavalry was sent north to Indian Territory. There they fought outlaws and settlers who were trying to take land set aside for Native Americans. For more than twenty years, the 9th and 10th served on the frontier from Texas to Montana. The Buffalo Soldiers earned fourteen Medals of Honor between 1870 and 1890. The Medal of Honor is the highest award a U.S. soldier can earn.
In 1898, the Buffalo Soldiers fought in the Spanish-American War. They took part in many battles and earned five Medals of Honor. Even so, some leaders in the U.S. Army still thought black soldiers were unable to perform as well as white soldiers.
Between 1899 and 1904, the Buffalo Soldiers worked as park rangers in several California national parks. They built roads and trails, fought forest fires, and stopped people from hunting animals and stealing timber. During World Wars I and II, new black regiments formed. They were still called the Buffalo Soldiers and were still led by white officers. They were kept separate from white soldiers until the Korean War (1950–1953), when they were mixed in with other units.
History remembers the Buffalo Soldiers as tough men who took on tough jobs. Although they were often treated poorly and often faced discrimination, they fought to prove they were good at their jobs. Their bravery and service are an important part of America’s story.",928.0

Scientists got involved, despite all the hoaxes. They wanted to learn whether Nessie was real and put an end to the mystery. There was enough consistent evidence that people couldn’t explain. For example, sonar picked up a long object moving 480 feet deep in the loch. That is too deep for most fish. They decided to map the entire loch. In 1987, scientists launched “Operation Deep Scan.” They used 24 boats to map the bottom and sides of the loch with sonar equipment. Sonar uses sound to identify the shapes of objects. A sound is sent out from a sonar machine. When the sound hits an object, the sound bounces back as an echo Scientists measure the time it takes for the sound to bounce back, which helps them create a picture. A sonar machine used in the loch shows objects that can’t be seen under the murky water. Some sounds from “Operation Deep Scan” were echoes from the loch’s steep sides. But they could not explain at least one echo from a “large and moving” object 200 feet down. No one knows for sure what the object was. Was it Nessie?
Studying the loch has turned up other findings. In 1981, the Loch Ness Project found fish called red-bellied Arctic (ARK-tick) char. They had been living at a depth of 700 feet (213 meters) for over 12,000 years—since the last ice age. Experts had thought the waters were too cold for life below a few hundred feet. The discovery of red-bellied Arctic char surprised them.
Maybe the Loch Ness Monster will one day lose its legendary status It might someday be identified as a new species.(SPEE-sheez) of fish. But for now, Nessie remains a mystery. That mystery might be its greatest appeal. The legend continues to capture people’s imaginations.",865.0
" Some young animals, especially orphans, are released slowly. Rehabbers put a pen in a safe place in the wild with the door left open so that the animal can return to it. Rehabbers provide food for the animal until it is clear that the animal can find food for itself. Wild animals rescued as adults are released much faster than young animals that never had to live on their own in nature. If possible, animals are released near where they were found.
About half the animals at rehabilitation centers are too sick or too badly injured to ever go back into the wild. Many animals have lost limbs, beaks, wings, or eyesight. A bird with a wing that did not heal well, or with only one eye, would not be able to fly or hunt in the wild. When it is clear that an animal will never survive in the wild or at a center, rehabbers have to make a hard decision. If the animal is in pain, a quick, painless killing is sometimes the best way to end that animal’s suffering.
Rehabbers often use animals that cannot go back to the wild to help teach people to respect wildlife. Children and adults learn about wildlife that live in their area. They also learn about respecting the land so that wild animals can continue to find food and shelter. Wildlife rehabbers do important work in caring for injured wild animals and returning many of them to the wild.

" Soon enough, you’ll get a whiff of its enticing aroma. Isn’t it great? Every once in a while, gently stir the pot with the large wooden spoon. That stirring ensures that all the ingredients and flavors blend to create a delectable whole. It’ll also prevent any vegetables from burning onto the bottom of the pot.
Let’s Eat!
After about thirty minutes, use your wooden spoon to fish out a piece of vegetable, such as a chunk of carrot. Blow on it a few times so it’s cool enough to taste and then take a bite to test the texture. If the carrot is tender, or nice and soft, then you’re finished. If it’s still hard and crunchy, let the soup simmer for several more minutes. Taste another vegetable every few minutes until you’re satisfied with the tenderness. But don’t overcook your soup—you don’t want your vegetables to be mushy. Once you’re happy with the soup, turn off the heat and serve your delicious creation with a ladle.
What do you think—not too shabby, right? You can serve your soup with a grilled cheese sandwich, some bread and butter, or all by itself. You can also store the leftovers in the refrigerator and reheat them on the stove or in the microwave. You probably have enough for warm, healthful lunches all week. And if you enjoyed this vegetable soup, you can follow the recipe steps using different types of vegetables. Try cooking soup with zucchini, broccoli, mushrooms, or red peppers. Almost any vegetable tastes fantastic in soup!
Now you can enjoy a hot, delicious homemade meal and feel proud of what you’ve accomplished. Not only are you eating vegetables full of essential vitamins and nutrients, but you also made this delicious soup like a professional chef.",923.0

Next, apply an even coating of grout to the surface. Then, press it into the cracks with a spatula or rubber float. Once all the cracks are filled with grout, you can begin to remove the rest from the surface. Start by thoroughly wiping the entire mosaic with a lightly dampened sponge. Have a bucket of clean water nearby. Use it to clean the sponge, wring it out, and then wipe the surface again. Repeat this until the surface is fairly clean and smooth.
Make sure all the pieces of tesserae are visible. Sometimes the thinner pieces get buried by the grout. There may still be a haze left on the surface of the mosaic, too. This can be wiped off with a clean, soft cloth in about an hour, as the grout hardens. When cleaning up, do not dump the water used to rinse the sponge down the drain. The grout can settle and harden in a drainpipe and cause future clogs. Also, when cleaning up after working with cement products such as grout, it is helpful to rinse your hands in vinegar before washing them. This will help restore the pH balance of your skin. After three days, the grout will harden completely and can be sealed. Sealing is not necessary, but if the mosaic will be outdoors or will often come into contact with moisture, good idea. This will also help seal out any stains.
Although the finished product looks very sophisticated and complex, making a mosaic is quite simple and requires only a few of materials and supplies. Beginners and professionals alike can create beautiful, lasting designs with broken tiles, pieces of broken dishes, and other unique objects. With these and a few other common tools, you can create your own mosaic in no time.",976.0
" Mauna Loa on Hawaii is the tallest volcano in the world, rising 9,170 meters (30,080 ft) from its base on the seafloor. That’s taller than Mount Everest! The largest known volcano in the solar system is Olympus Mons on Mars. This Martian shield volcano rises an amazing 27 kilometers (17 mi) in height.
Some volcanoes don’t form large mountains. Instead, they just spray small amounts of lava into the air. The small lava chunks and bits of ash harden into light rocks called cinders. The cinders pile up around the vent into a hill with a bowl-shaped crater at the top. These hills are called cinder cones. New volcanoes often produce cinder cones. Other cinder cones form inside the craters or calderas of larger, older volcanoes. Most cinder cones erupt only once. Because cinder cones are made of loose rocks, they are quickly worn away by wind and rain.
Small, quick eruptions sometimes form lava domes. Lava domes are created when thick lava oozes from a vent and quickly hardens. Sometimes more lava pushes through the dome, causing its sides to crack. Lava domes often form in areas with other volcanic activity. They can often be found in the craters of large volcanoes. Like composite volcanoes, lava domes often explode violently.
Volcanoes are impressive examples of how our planet is always changing. Many good things come from volcanoes. Lava creates new rock and new land. Volcanic ash makes rich soil for farming. And volcanic mountains, including Mount Fuji in Japan, Mount Rainier in Washington, and Mauna Loa in Hawaii, are some of the most beautiful mountains in the world. It is no wonder that people often choose to live near volcanoes. But everyone should always remember that volcanoes are dangerous. Volcanoes set free some of Earth’s most powerful forces.",966.0

By the time the United States entered World War II in 1941, doughnuts had become a part of American life. Women working for the American Red Cross took a page from the Doughnut Girls of World War I and brought soldiers on the front lines hot coffee and doughnuts. Soldiers soon began calling the women Doughnut Dollies.
When World War II ended in 1945, the doughnut was at the height of its popularity. More and more restaurants and chains began to appear. In 1948, Verne Winchell had intended to open a hamburger drive-thru in Temple City, California, but someone across the street beat him to it. So he changed course and decided to open a coffee and doughnut shop instead. William Rosenberg had a food truck business. He parked his truck in front of a factory, and the workers would buy sandwiches, coffee, and baked goods on their breaks. He noticed that he sold more coffee and doughnuts than anything else. Since those items were the least expensive to make, he decided to open a doughnut shop. In 1950, Dunkin’ Donuts opened its doors in Quincy, Massachusetts.
Doughnuts contain large amounts of fat and sugar, so they are not considered a healthy food. As a result, the popularity of the pastry has declined in recent years. Despite this decline, over ten billion doughnuts are still being made in the United States each year. Doughnuts are now a multibillion-dollar industry, making them highly profitable since the basic doughnut is made with inexpensive ingredients. Doughnuts have been around for many years, and it’s safe to assume that Americans will be eating them far into the future. No doubt the humble doughnut is here to stay.",1062.0
" The Puritans, for example, discouraged people from celebrating it. The holiday became much more popular when huge numbers of Irish immigrants came to the United States in the 1800s. They brought their Halloween traditions with them, including jack-o’-lanterns and mumming. Gradually, more and more Americans celebrated Halloween. Unfortunately, though, as Halloween celebrations became more popular, pranks became common on Halloween night. By the 1930s, the pranks had become a major problem. Some city governments tried to remake Halloween into a family holiday with trick-or-treating events for children. Trick-or-treaters in the 1930s and 1940s received cookies, fruit, toys, and pocket change.
Candy became a popular treat as trick-or-treating gained steam in the 1950s. However, the little Halloween candy bars common today didn’t appear until the 1970s. Although the treats have changed over the years, kids’ enthusiasm hasn’t. In the United States alone, more than 41 million children went trick-or-treating in 2014.
Halloween’s popularity is growing. Especially in the United States and Canada, more people celebrate Halloween every year. Some cities hold community trick-or-treating events at malls, churches, and community centers. These events help keep trick-or-treaters safe from street traffic. The crowds aren’t made up of kids alone, though. Adults are celebrating Halloween in increasing numbers. In 2015, people planned to spend more on costumes for adults than on costumes for children. Many adults also host or go to Halloween parties as well as dress in costume. Halloween is fun for kids—but adults definitely don’t want to be left out.
Halloween today looks quite different from the celebrations of the 1950s, the 1800s, and the Samhain festival of the ancient Celts. Its traditions are still changing, mixing the old with the new. Today, Halloween is rich with traditions from several different cultures that people of all ages can enjoy.",998.0
" Muir helped found the Sierra Club in 1892 and became its first president. The Sierra Club has since become a leading conservation organization. In 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt asked to meet with Muir. He wanted to better understand the needs of wilderness areas in the West. Honored, Muir took him on a camping trip into Yosemite. During the trip, Muir urged the president to set aside wilderness areas as protected parks. As a result, more areas of Yosemite became part of the national park. Roosevelt also set aside many other wilderness areas for protection.
In his later years, Muir spent more time writing about his travels. He was awarded honorary degrees from four universities. Muir also led a twelve-year fight to protect Yosemite’s Hetch Hetchy Valley from being flooded by a proposed dam. Despite efforts to stop the project, including a letter Muir wrote to Congress, it was approved in 1913. However, the fight raised awareness about the protection of wild places. It also contributed to the 1916 creation of the National Park Service (NPS). The NPS established stronger protections for all U.S. national parks. John Muir died on December 24, 1914. Although he did not live to see the founding of the National Park Service, his efforts helped make it a reality.
John Muir was one of the first people to call for practical action to preserve wild places. As a founding father of the conservation movement, he devoted much of his life to protecting nature for future generations. John Muir struggled for years to find his true path in life. Yet the natural world always called to him, inviting him to witness more of its wonders. As he did, his purpose became clear. Muir’s contributions to environmental conservation have earned him a place of honor in American history.",970.0
" It is over 2,000 meters (7,000 ft) deep, and spelunkers aren’t done exploring! One of the most world-famous caves is the Chauvet (shaw-VAY) Cave in France. Discovered in 1994, it contains over 300 of the world’s oldest paintings. Dated as approximately 30,000 years old, the paintings include horses, lions, and bears.
Why do spelunkers go into caves? Some do it for the thrill of physically challenging themselves by climbing down ropes, crawling through tiny tunnels, or scuba diving in underground caverns. Scientists enter caves to learn more about Earth. Experienced cave explorers equip themselves with helmets, flashlights, warm clothing, rope, and kneepads. As the spelunkers go deeper, they may have to wriggle through tiny tunnels. They may wade through underground pools or rivers. In the cave, they hear water drip-drip-dripping, but no other sound. The only light is the glow of their flashlights.
A cave is exciting, but it can definitely be dangerous. It is easy to get lost in the twisting, pitch-black tunnels or trapped in a narrow space. Cave floors can be steep and rocky, or slick with mud. It takes the skills of a hardy rock climber to explore many caves. Cave formations can be extremely delicate. Thoughtless cave visitors have broken off stalactite tips as souvenirs, destroying in a second something that may have taken 40,000 years to form. If you ever plan to visit a cave, take a guided tour. The guide can explain the many wonders of the cave and keep both you and the formations safe.
The world of caves is fascinating. Where else on Earth can you find unexplored land, discover otherworldly formations, and see artwork from thousands of years ago? As long as we treat them respectfully, we can continue to experience the wonder of caves indefinitely.",1006.0

Pope Leo I met with Attila at the Huns’ camp. What the two men said to each other was not recorded. But Attila agreed to stop his attacks. This victory greatly increased the prestige of the pope. However, some historians believe that Attila was in a weaker position than many people realized. They believe his army had not fully recovered from the Battle of Chalons, and many of his men were dying of a plague. In addition, he was running short of food and other supplies. Whatever Attila’s reasons were, he left Italy, never to return.
Attila stopped pretending to need Honoria as a bride. In fact, he already had a number of wives. In 453 he took a new bride, a beautiful young woman named Ildico. After a day of feasting, Attila and Ildico went to bed. The next morning, Attila failed to emerge from his bedroom. Worried servants entered his room and found Ildico trembling with fear. On the bed lay Attila. He was dead. During the night, the king had suffered a burst blood vessel in his nose or throat. He drowned to death on his own blood.
After the death of Attila, the Huns’ empire did not last. His numerous sons split the empire among themselves. Under Attila, the Huns had been united, but now they became divided. Their lack of unity caused them to grow weak. Germanic tribes that had been ruled by Attila saw that the Huns were weakening. In 454, they revolted. Within a few years, they had overthrown the Huns. With their empire shattered, the Huns fled. In the words of one historian, they were “scattered to the winds.” Once the terror of humanity, the Huns made no more lasting marks on history.",756.0
" Within an hour after the attack, the South Tower began to fall in on itself and crumble to the ground. The North Tower followed thirty minutes later. New Yorkers watched in stunned disbelief as these enormous structures were reduced to heaps of burning rubble. Nearly three thousand people died as a result of the attack.
The World Trade Center tragedy devastated New York and the rest of the country. New Yorkers mourned the loss of their neighbors and their landmark. At the same time, they vowed to rebuild at the World Trade Center site.
Excavating the ruins of the old towers took time. Plans for the site took years to develop; there were many opinions on what should be done, and many designs were submitted with considerable controversy. Finally, the Port Authority unveiled the design for the new World Trade Center complex. One area was set aside as a memorial park for those who lost their lives that day. The sites where the original buildings stood are now reflecting pools with cascading waterfalls. A memorial museum contains items from the old towers.
Nearby, a new 104-story tower has been constructed. Nicknamed the Freedom Tower, the structure rises an astonishing 1,776 feet (541 m). The building’s height symbolizes the year of the United States’ independence. The glass-paneled tower has a twisted octagon shape, and its huge reflective surface mirrors the changes in light all around it. At the top is a spire equipped with a light beam that is visible for miles.
Several other high-rises are being constructed at the site as well. By the year 2020, the new World Trade Center complex should be complete. New York’s ever-changing skyline will reflect the spirit of a city that continues to adapt and grow.",943.0
" Some people thought his efforts showed that he was losing touch. Einstein didn’t pay much attention to this criticism. He believed that he could develop a new theory that would unify his original ideas with the latest theories. He remained dedicated to his work and ideas, yet he never achieved the sort of breakthroughs he’d had during the “miracle year” or with his General Theory of Relativity. Always in demand, he continued to give speeches, write articles, and meet regularly with fellow scientists.
Einstein was not an inventor. Yet his curiosity led to the creation of many useful products. For example, Einstein’s ideas about the nature and behavior of light led scientists to develop new ways to control light. These technologies eventually led to television cameras, remote controls for home electronics, and flat-screen computers. Einstein was also the first person to think of laser light. This technology is now used in compact discs (CDs), digital video discs (DVDs), and supermarket checkout equipment. His proof of the existence of atoms and molecules led to the creation or improvement of a wide range of everyday products. Those products include shaving cream, toothpaste, personal computers, and portable phones.
Einstein’s scientific ideas continue to influence new theories. Current ideas about the origins of the universe, the nature of space, and strange objects called black holes all owe a large debt to Einstein’s work.
Einstein once said, “The most beautiful experience we can have is the mysterious . . . . It is enough to try to understand a little of this mystery every day .”
Until his death on April 18, 1955, Einstein’s curiosity led him to work to understand nature’s greatest mysteries . In doing so, he changed the way people think about time, space, energy, and matter—the foundations of the universe .",1090.0

After a brief rest, the remaining three ships left Guam and sailed west. They landed on the island of Cebu in the Philippines in April 1521. Magellan began acting strangely. He mistakenly believed he had reached the Spice Islands and declared that he was now the sole European allowed to trade with the native people. Later, he became involved in a dispute between tribal chiefs. He brought some of his men to another island to show a band of native warriors that they were no match for European weapons. Instead, the outnumbered Spanish were quickly defeated. Magellan, the expedition’s fearless leader, was killed in the battle, along with a dozen members of his crew.
After the defeat, the Concepción was burned since it was in no condition to sail. The Trinidad and Victoria traveled west to the Spice Islands. The ships picked up a small cargo of spices and continued west along the Portuguese trade route, but the Trinidad began to leak and stayed behind. The Victoria, commanded by a Basque sailor, took on some of the Trinidad’s crew and sailed across the Indian Ocean and around the southern tip of Africa. In September 1522, the ship limped into port with just eighteen crew members, the sole survivors of the grueling two-year voyage around the world.
Ferdinand Magellan’s mission was to establish a flourishing Spanish trade route to Asia. In that sense, the mission was a failure. It was, however, an incredible navigational success. It showed that it was possible to reach Asia by sailing west rather than east. The Victoria circumnavigated the globe and confirmed the true size and scope of Earth and its vast oceans. Magellan may not have completed the voyage, but his leadership and courage helped expand knowledge of the world and clear the decks for future exploration.",1027.0

Do You Know?
The Egyptians stopped making mummies around ad 400. By this time, most Egyptians had converted to Christianity. They no longer believed that the dead person needed to be mummified in order to experience eternal life.
The ancient Egyptians mummified animals as well as people. Cats were especially sacred to the Egyptians. They represented Bast, the cat-headed goddess of happiness. Cats were kept as pets, and when one died, the whole family shaved their heads and eyebrows in mourning. Cat mummies were buried with their owners or at the temples of Bast.
Ancient Egyptians also mummified other animals sacred to the gods, such as crocodiles, ibises, and falcons. These animals were sent to the afterlife as offerings to the gods.
Natural mummies have been found around the world. They can be found in the cold, acidic water of a marsh in Denmark, in the frozen depths of an Alpine glacier, or in the hot sands of a desert.
The dead have been preserved as mummies by many different cultures, from Buddhist monks in Japan to tribesmen in Papua New Guinea. The Incas in Peru, half a world away from the ancient Egyptians, mummified their ancestors in much the same way as the Egyptians. While artificial and natural mummification vary in some ways, they are alike in one important way. All mummification results in the arrest of cell decay, which preserves the body for hundreds, if not thousands, of years.",1013.0
" The late summer and early fall months are storm season in the Caribbean. Over the years, Puerto Rico has been battered by the fierce winds and heavy rains of hurricanes.
One of the worst storms was Hurricane Maria in 2017. It was the tenth-strongest Atlantic hurricane ever recorded. Maria was a Category 4 storm when it hit the island on September 20. Winds of 249 kilometers per hour (155 mph) tore buildings to shreds. Flooding decimated coastal villages. Hundreds of Puerto Ricans lost their lives or were reported missing. What was once an island paradise became a major disaster zone.
Getting help to surviving residents was difficult. Airports and roadways were covered with debris and were heavily damaged. Power lines had been destroyed, making communication almost impossible. A lack of fresh water caused health concerns. People were upset with the local and federal governments for not being prepared and for not responding quickly.
National and international agencies assembled to help the people of Puerto Rico. Military helicopters carried victims to hospital ships anchored offshore. Helicopters also dropped supplies to locations that could not be reached by road. Utility crews from the U.S. mainland were flown in to help repair power lines and restore electricity.
Help came from other sources as well. Celebrities and athletes with ties to the island raised funds to help victims of the hurricane. Still, the recovery process was slow. Months after Maria hit, half the island was still without electricity.
Puerto Ricans know how to deal with hardships. The island is a land rich in resources. The most valuable resource, though, is its people. Over time, the spirit and love Puerto Ricans feel for their homeland will help them rebuild their island. Puerto Rico will once again be the welcoming paradise it has always been.",869.0
" Cook observed the stars as he sailed, and whenever he came to a new land, he learned about its plants and animals. His work broadened the European understanding of the world.
Cook was a great sailor and an intelligent explorer. He also kept his crew healthy by making them eat foods such as limes and cabbages. Until Cook’s time, up to one-half of the crew on a long voyage would die of scurvy or other diseases. Cook knew his success as an explorer depended on keeping his crew in good health. Soon, all British sailors knew that they needed to eat vitamin C to survive. Sadly, although Cook tried to remain friendly everywhere he went, he was killed in a fight in Hawaii in 1779.
By the middle of the 1800s, sailors had explored and mapped most of the world’s coastlines. As people settled farther from their homelands, larger ships were needed to move people and supplies over great distances. Very fast ships called clipper ships carried people across oceans in a matter of days. Some of these ships had as many as thirty-five sails and could travel even in very light winds.
By the 1870s, however, the steam engine largely replaced wind power. The industrial revolution swung into full gear, and machines became more significant to everyone. Bigger and faster ships than had ever been imagined suddenly became possible. Today, steam is outdated and ships run on different types of fuel. Some submarines and aircraft carriers even run on nuclear power! Giant cruise ships carry thousands of people at a time like floating cities. When we look at some of the ships used by early explorers to sail across oceans, we have to admire their courage. Explorers and their ships of discovery helped create the world we live in.",999.0

Finally they could hear something splashing up through the waves behind the canoe. One of Maui’s brothers glanced back to see what they had caught—and then he screamed, horrified. He saw an enormous island surfacing behind them, caught fast on Maui’s magic fishing hook. It looked like a monstrous fish about to devour them all.
Maui gave one final, enormous heave and cast the line free, settling the island into place. Suddenly, the brothers found that they were paddling in shallow water next to a beach. Exhausted, they rested on their oars and looked up in wonder at the island that Maui had raised out of the ocean.
That is how the hero Maui lifted the Pacific Islands out of the sea.
Maui gave humankind many gifts, including the gift of summer, the gift of the islands, and the gift of the sky. But there was one boon he was not able to grant humankind: the gift of immortality.
Maui believed that it was not right that people should die. He decided to attempt to steal the secret of immortality from Hine (HEE-nay), the goddess who kept the secret to immortal life in her heart. Maui knew that the only way to steal the secret was to steal Hine’s heart.
Gathering his courage, Maui approached Hine while she was sleeping and dived into her open mouth. He found Hine’s heart and nearly escaped with it—but Hine woke just as he was trying to come out of her mouth again. She caught Maui in her teeth and killed him.
Maui was not successful in giving humanity the gift of immortality, but humanity remembers him and honors him for the attempt. In this way, the hero Maui survives as the stories about him are passed down from generation to generation.",982.0

I feel as if I might wish for anything—diamonds or bags of gold—and they would appear! That wouldn’t be any stranger than this. Is this my garret? Am I the same cold, ragged, damp Sara?

" Napoleon wanted to conquer lands in Europe, including Great Britain. England had to defend itself. The Napoleonic Wars ended in 1815 with Great Britain and its allies again defeating Britain’s old rival.
In 1809, Great Britain celebrated George III’s fiftieth year on the throne. Despite his reign’s rough beginnings, the king had reached new heights of popularity, and most subjects believed that George III had led his country well for half a century. Thousands of his subjects cheered him. The following year, the king suffered a terrible tragedy. His youngest daughter died suddenly of tuberculosis at the age of twenty-seven. The king was shocked and heartbroken. Soon the symptoms of his earlier illness returned. He went into a steep physical and mental decline. In 1811, it became clear that the king could no longer perform his duties. The British Parliament named his eldest son, George, as regent, or temporary ruler. When George III finally passed away in January 1820, young George ascended to the throne just as his father had done decades earlier.
King George’s legacy offers a picture of a complicated yet strong leader. Some people think of George III as the king who let the American colonies win their independence. Others think of him as the ruler who went insane. Many historians, however, have begun to rethink their opinions of him. Some historians believe symptoms of his mental illness are linked to physical disease. As a leader, George III always put his country first. He rallied and led his nation to victories in the Seven Years’ War and the Napoleonic Wars. He also fought hard to keep the British colonies in America. The king’s personal life has also been given more consideration, and history has shown that George was a hard worker, a loyal husband, and a loving father.",968.0
" Scribes wrote text used in religious ceremonies. Sadly, most Mayan books were destroyed during the Spanish conquest of the region in the sixteenth century. Mayan writing was often used to record a king’s victories in battle. Monuments and temples had glyphs carved into their stone walls and obelisks. The messages were a kind of propaganda written to boast about a ruler’s achievements. The displays were a way for rulers to show authority and assert their power.
It was up to the scribes to post these messages in public. This was easy and safe for scribes of a victorious king. It was not as easy, however, for scribes who were on the losing side of a battle. Conquerors believed that the best way to win the war of words was to deny their enemy the chance to use them. Captured scribes from the losing side often had their hands hurt to keep them from ever writing again. Amazing examples of Mayan glyphs can be seen at sites throughout the Yucatan Peninsula. Ruins at Palenque, Teotihuacan, and Tikal bear the beautiful and ornate stone markings of ancient scribes.
The beautiful picture languages of the ancient Maya and the Egyptians are no longer used. Many other ancient picture languages, however, are still used today. Asian languages, such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, feature thousands of pictographic symbols. Modern picture languages exist as well. Simple block glyphs appear on signs for international travel. These symbols direct travelers from all parts of the world where to get their bags or catch a bus. It’s much easier to use glyphs than to make signs in many languages. Now, as in the past, a single picture sometimes works just as well as a dozen words!",984.0
" During the rest of that day there was no other adventure to mar the peace of their journey. Once, indeed, the Tin Woodman stepped upon a beetle that was crawling along the road, and killed the poor little thing. This made the Tin Woodman very unhappy, for he was always careful not to hurt any living creature; and as he walked along he wept several tears of sorrow and regret. These tears ran slowly down his face and over the hinges of his jaw, and there they rusted.
When Dorothy presently asked him a question the Tin Woodman could not open his mouth, for his jaws were tightly rusted together. He became greatly frightened at this and made many motions to Dorothy to relieve him, but she could not understand. The Lion was also puzzled to know what was wrong. But the Scarecrow seized the oil-can from Dorothy’s basket and oiled the Woodman’s jaws, so that after a few moments he could talk as well as before. “This will serve me a lesson,” said he, “to look where I step. For if I should kill another bug or beetle I should surely cry again, and crying rusts my jaws so that I cannot speak.” Thereafter he walked very carefully, with his eyes on the road, and when he saw a tiny ant toiling by he would step over it, so as not to harm it. The Tin Woodman knew very well he had no heart, and therefore he took great care never to be cruel or unkind to anything. “You people with hearts,” he said, “have something to guide you, and need never do wrong; but I have no heart, and so I must be very careful.

Even those who live in the City must wear spectacles night and day. They are all locked on, for Oz so ordered it when the City was first built, and I have the only key that will unlock them.”
He opened the big box, and Dorothy saw that it was filled with spectacles of every size and shape. All of them had green glasses in them. The Guardian of the Gates found a pair that would just fit Dorothy and put them over her eyes. There were two golden bands fastened to them that passed around the back of her head, where they were locked together by a little key that was at the end of a chain the Guardian of the Gates wore around his neck. When they were on, Dorothy could not take them off had she wished, but of course she did not wish to be blinded by the glare of the Emerald City, so she said nothing. Then the green man fitted spectacles for the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman and the Lion, and even on little Toto; and all were locked fast with the key. Then the Guardian of the Gates put on his own glasses and told them he was ready to show them to the Palace.

Do come back again, and we won’t talk about cats or dogs either, if you don’t like them!” When the Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low trembling voice, “Let us get to the shore, and then I’ll tell you my history, and you’ll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.” It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice led the way, and the whole party swam to the shore.",975.0
" Families generally have fewer children if they believe the children they have will survive. Second, governments can provide help for elderly and sick people so that parents will know someone will take care of them when they are old. Third, educate women. When women are educated and given control over deciding the size of their family, they tend to have fewer children.
Consider the United States. Because it has gone past its carrying capacity, Americans must bring in resources from other countries to keep up their standard of living. With seven billion people on Earth, we’d need three or four more planets for everyone to live like most people in the United States. Everyone in the world can have enough to eat, however, if people in rich countries eat smarter and waste less. For example, grain is the world’s most important source of food. Yet as meat production has boomed for rich and developing countries, a third of the grain grown worldwide is used to feed livestock. It takes between 11 pounds (4.99 kg) and 16 pounds (7.25 kg) of grain to create 1 pound (0.45 kg) of meat. Eating less meat means more grain for people in poor countries and protection of valuable grasslands. Average Americans use 3 times the food and 250 times the fresh water needed to survive. They are the world’s biggest consumers. They could instead be the world’s most efficient consumers if they make intelligent choices about how to live.
The Rapanui left records on carved tablets, but no one can translate the ancient language today. Even so, we can still learn from the Rapanui. Hopefully, the tale of their little island can teach us to protect our limited resources on Earth, our own little island in space.",1108.0
" Europe was left a very different world after this health catastrophe. One result was a huge shortage of workers. The lack of skilled craftspeople and laborers caused a crisis in manufacturing. Workers were able to demand better pay and treatment.
Fields were left unplanted or unharvested without peasants to work them. Livestock died without tending. As a result, many areas in Europe suffered food shortages and starvation. Survivors’ views about society and the meaning of life changed, too. Many questioned their belief in the church, and some challenged their rulers. The authority of powerful individuals had proven useless in protecting the people they controlled. There were many examples of significant progress. Farmers experimented with better practices and equipment to grow more food with fewer hands. Public health and medicine also saw positive changes. More communities recognized the importance of sanitation and cleanliness. They put in place better ways to handle disease outbreaks.
Modern medicine has made another outbreak of the Black Death all but impossible. Plague bacteria are still out there, living in the fleas of some rodent colonies. However, modern medicines can quickly stop most outbreaks. Public sanitation and health programs also help control the spread of most forms of disease.
In the mid-1300s, the mystery and horror of the Black Death terrorized Europe. Many people there believed it was the end of the world. In terms of death rates, it remains the most destructive event in European history.At the same time, some historians link the disaster to many changes for the better that followed. From the late 1300s until the 1600s was a period in Europe known as the Renaissance. It inspired great advancements in medicine, science, and art. Renaissance means “rebirth” in French. After the Black Death, a period of rebirth was precisely what Europe needed.",933.0
" Thus I made a cave, just behind my tent, which served me like a cellar to my house. Having now fixed my shelter, I found it absolutely necessary to provide a place to make a fire in, and fuel to burn. What I did for that, and how I enlarged my cave, I shall tell in its place. But I must now give some mention of myself, and of my thoughts about living.
I was cast away upon that island after having been driven by a violent storm. We were quite out of the course of our intended voyage, and some hundreds of leagues out of ordinary trade routes. I had great reason to consider it my fate that in this desolate place, and in this desolate manner, I should end my life. The tears would run plentifully down my face when I had these thoughts. Sometimes I would ask myself why I was so absolutely miserable, so without help, abandoned, so entirely depressed. It could hardly be reasonable to be thankful for such a life.
But something always turned around inside me and stopped these thoughts. Particularly one day, walking by the seaside, I was very sorrowful about my present condition. But I thought to myself, “Well, you are in a desolate condition, it is true. But, pray remember, where is the rest of your crew? Did not eleven of you come in the boat? Where are the other ten? Why were they not saved, and you lost? Why were you singled out? Is it better to be here or there?” and then I pointed to the sea. All evils are to be compared with the good that is in them, and with what worse might have been.",917.0

“Your sister asked for it, I suppose?” “No, I never heard of her using it. We used always to get what we wanted for ourselves.” “Indeed, it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bell-pull there. You will excuse me for a few minutes while I satisfy myself as to this floor.” He threw himself down upon his face with his lens in his hand and crawled swiftly backward and forward, examining minutely the cracks between the boards. Then he did the same with the wood-work with which the chamber was panelled. Finally he walked over to the bed and spent some time in staring at it and in running his eye up and down the wall. Finally he took the bell-rope in his hand and gave it a brisk tug. “Why, it’s a dummy,” said he. “Won’t it ring?” “No, it is not even attached to a wire. This is very interesting. You can see now that it is fastened to a hook just above where the little opening for the ventilator is.” “How very absurd! I never noticed that before.”
“Very strange!” muttered Holmes, pulling at the rope. “There are one or two very singular points about this room. For example, what a fool a builder must be to open a ventilator into another room, when, with the same trouble, he might have communicated with the outside air!” “That is also quite modern,” said the lady. “Done about the same time as the bell-rope?” remarked Holmes. “Yes, there were several little changes carried out about that time.” “They seem to have been of a most interesting character—dummy bell-ropes, and ventilators which do not ventilate. With your permission, Miss Stoner, we shall now carry our researches into the inner apartment.”",760.0
" He doubled it. And to cap it all, when Mercedes, with tears in her pretty eyes and a quaver in her throat, could not cajole him into giving the dogs still more, she stole from the fish-sacks and fed them slyly. But it was not food that Buck and the huskies needed, but rest. And though they were making poor time, the heavy load they dragged sapped their strength severely. Then came the underfeeding. Hal awoke one day to the fact that his dog-food was half gone and the distance only quarter covered; further, that for love or money no additional dog-food was to be obtained. So he cut down even the orthodox ration and tried to increase the day’s travel.
His sister and brother-in-law seconded him; but they were frustrated by their heavy outfit and their own incompetence. It was a simple matter to give the dogs less food; but it was impossible to make the dogs travel faster, while their own inability to get under way earlier in the morning prevented them from travelling longer hours. Not only did they not know how to work dogs, but they did not know how to work themselves. The first to go was Dub. His wrenched shoulder-blade, untreated and unrested, went from bad to worse, till finally Hal shot him with the big Colt’s revolver. It is a saying of the country that an Outside dog starves to death on the ration of the husky, so the six Outside dogs under Buck could do no less than die on half the ration of the husky.

The very cold Deep Ocean Zone has more than one million hot volcanoes in it. The water temperature at a volcano can be 400ºC (752ºF), which is hot enough to melt lead. Species such as eyeless shrimp, white crabs, giant tube worms, and many bacteria live in this very hot water. These animals use sulfur rather than sunlight to live.
Huge groups of Arctic and Antarctic animals were also found living in water that is close to or below freezing. Giant squid, Antarctic cod, and the lion’s mane jellyfish are some species that live under solid ice that is 700 meters (2,296 ft) thick. Many of these species slow down their movements to save energy so they don’t freeze.
What Did We Learn?
Scientists learned that life is even more adaptable than they originally thought. Animals living in the deep ocean have found ways to survive in harsh environments that would be impossible for most other species to live in. The marine census counted more than 230,000 species in more than 30 million records. More than 6,000 new species had never been seen before! Some animals were see-through, or translucent. Some had warning lights that turn on and off so that they can see in the darkness. Others had long feelers instead of eyes to attract prey and learn what was around them. Some had teeth so long that they overlapped their jaws. Others made their own antifreeze to stay warm.
What else lives in the deep ocean? Scientists keep discovering new species and new facts. The more they look, the more they find. They think that only one quarter of all marine life has been counted. Not all the animals that have been discovered have been documented and described. There are many more surprises to come!",912.0
" The animal can’t stop moving, so the eel senses where it is. Then the electric eel sends out its attack shock, which stuns or kills the prey. The electric eel quickly sucks the prey through its mouth into its stomach before its meal swims away. Electric eels mostly eat small fish, crustaceans, and amphibians, but young eels also eat worms and insect larvae.
Don’t Swim There!
Electric eels are top predators in the slow-moving rivers where they often live. Scientists have found them in the Amazon and Orinoco Rivers in South America and in nearby freshwater swamps, creeks, ponds, and lakes. Because they breathe air, electric eels can live in water that might kill other fish. They can also live out of water for hours if their skin stays wet.
Electric eels mostly mate in small ponds. Male eels build nests by making bubbles with their saliva. Female eels lay eggs in the bubbles. Males guard the nests and the baby eels until they are about 10 centimeters (4 in.) long. Then the babies have to live on their own. Because of their weaker shocks, young electric eels are more likely than adults to be prey for other animals, such as crocodiles.
Scientists now know more about electric eels than Humboldt did, but they are not done learning. Scientists at Yale University want to use electrocytes as a model to create cells that act like batteries. Some medical devices—such as pacemakers, which keep hearts beating—contain batteries that could harm a person if they break. Scientists want to create batteries that won’t be harmful and won’t run out of power. Humboldt wrote more than two hundred years ago, “We are, doubtless, very far from having discovered all the secrets of the electrical action of fishes.” What will electric eels help scientists understand next?",978.0
" A pregnant female that died had more than three hundred babies, or pups, growing inside her. The growing sharks were 16 to 24 inches (42–63 cm) long. Some were more developed than others, so they would have been born sooner.
Except for their smaller size, pups look like adult whale sharks. Not much is known about whale shark births because no one has ever observed one. Scientists think that whale sharks give birth in the open ocean rather than near shore. Young whale sharks become adults at around thirty years of age. No one knows how long they live, but sharks as a group have long lives. Because of their large size, scientists think that whale sharks could live for one hundred years.
Care for a Swim?
Swimming with whale sharks is popular in the places where these huge creatures gather. More than twelve thousand people swim or dive with whale sharks each year. Tour companies have rules for keeping both the whale sharks and the people safe. One woman who swam with whale sharks said that her first sight of them took her breath away. She described swimming with these giants as an experience of a lifetime. She said, “There is no reason to fear these gentle creatures and every reason to see them up close!”
Gentle Giants You might expect the biggest fish on the planet—a shark—to be a frightening creature, but the whale shark is nothing of the sort. This huge animal is peaceful and slow moving. It’s a symbol of good luck in parts of Asia. On an island off the coast of Africa, its name means “many stars.” In Vietnam, it’s called “Sir Fish” and is believed to offer protection. People who study or swim with whale sharks confirm that these enormous fish truly are gentle giants.",974.0
" If someone tried to pay attention to her, Kobuk would grab the attention for himself. He also insisted on going out the door first for daily walks. If Tika was in the way, he’d often knock her down.
One day, Anne discovered a tumor on Tika’s leg that turned out to be malignant. Somehow Kobuk knew, and his behavior toward Tika immediately changed. He insisted on staying by her side day and night, and frequently groomed her face and ears. After Tika’s leg was amputated to remove the cancer, Kobuk watched over her attentively. Anne could tell Kobuk was terribly worried to see Tika suffer.
One night Kobuk woke up Anne with great urgency. He ran over to Tika, and Anne took them both outside. Anne discovered that Tika’s belly was swollen and huge. Tika’s stomach had filled with air, a condition that can be life-threatening. A visit to an emergency veterinary clinic saved Tika’s life, but only because of Kobuk’s alert warning. Tika recovered from her surgeries and learned to walk on three legs. Kobuk went back to being his rambunctious self—but only after he had proven his devotion to his beloved mate.
This book contains just a few of the many inspiring stories of animal love and devotion. These kinds of interactions take place all the time in the animal kingdom when people aren’t watching. Each interaction provides evidence that animals can and do feel love. The next time you see animals interacting, consider the fact that they are family to each other. Just because they can’t speak the words I love you, as humans do, doesn’t mean they don’t feel the emotion behind the words. Their loyalty, devotion, and compassion for each other leave no doubt that animals are capable of love.",871.0
" Often you don’t feel their bite, but over the next few hours a blister forms at the site. Eventually the blister breaks open, a scab forms, and tissue dies. This can cover a large area, and it can last for weeks or months.
Brown recluse spider bites usually aren’t part of a diagnosis in the emergency room because the symptoms take time to develop. Aside from a black widow or a brown recluse spider, other spider bites won’t cause any serious problems unless the bite gets infected.
Interviewer: And what about other snakes?
Jude: There are many more nonvenomous than venomous snakes. A lot of snakes we call nonvenomous actually have venom, but a bite isn’t a serious health risk. It can make us feel sore, and once in a while blisters and swelling develop at the site, but nothing serious. It’s estimated that in the United States there are over 35,000 snakebites each year, and 6,000 to 8,000 of them are venomous.
Interviewer: Do you have any advice for readers?
Jude: Besides rattlesnakes, almost all bites and stings we deal with happen in and around people’s homes. Spiders and scorpions are active at night; they seek a dark crack or crevice during the day. You’re more likely to come across them at night when they’re active, so turning on lights at night will reduce your risk.
If you see something dangerous and take one step back, you usually remove yourself from the range of danger. And if you leave the animal alone, you lower your risk. More than half the people we treat for a rattlesnake bite saw the snake, recognized the danger, and put themselves at greater risk. If you make smart choices, you’re much more likely to stay safe.",887.0

The act also said that workers had to be paid extra when they work longer hours than usual, or overtime. Workers earn one-and-a-half times their usual hourly rate for each hour of overtime they work. (Overtime is each hour over forty worked in a workweek.) Overtime pay was meant to keep employers from forcing people to work too many hours. It was also meant to encourage employers to hire more workers. The act also set safety rules in the workplace and banned many kinds of child labor. It set the minimum age for workers at sixteen during school hours. Fourteen-year-olds could work at certain after-school jobs, but workers had to be eighteen for dangerous jobs.
Labor Day was first celebrated in New York City in 1882. In 1887, Oregon became the first state to pass a law making Labor Day an official holiday. Thirty more states passed similar laws before the U.S. government made Labor Day a federal holiday in 1894.
Canada also celebrates Labor Day on the first Monday in September. More than sixty other countries around the world instead celebrate International Workers’ Day on May 1. Famous people, including the president, give speeches on Labor Day. Parades have been common since the holiday began. Many communities also have festivals featuring music, crafts, fall foods, or special events.
The labor movement improved the way workers are treated and paid. It set limits for workdays and workweeks, introduced safety regulations, brought an end to child labor, and more. Labor Day honors these accomplishments as well as the efforts of all American workers to build and help their country. So enjoy a day off on Labor Day and be sure to have some fun. Just remember to also honor the people who labored to improve the lives of every American worker.",1045.0

A female ostrich lays six or more eggs in a shallow depression in the sand. All females in the herd place their eggs in the main hen’s nest. The main hen sits on them during the day, and the dominant male takes night duty. The eggs hatch after about forty days. Few animals mess with adult ostriches, but their eggs can be stolen by predators such as vultures, jackals, and hyenas, which may also take young ostriches. Ostrich chicks are the size of full-grown chickens when they hatch. Males and females work together to care for the chicks. The dominant male protects them by distracting predators and also teaches the chicks what to eat. They grow about 1 foot (30 cm) each month. By the age of six months, they’re close to adult size. Ostriches can live to age fifty or older.
Ostrich numbers dropped sharply in the 1700s and 1800s because they were hunted for their feathers, which were used in women’s fashion long ago. They were also hunted for food and leather as well as for making feather dusters. When ostrich farming began in 1838, some wild herds recovered. Wild ostriches are not at risk of becoming endangered. Ostriches are now farmed around the world for meat, leather, feathers, and eggs.
Unlike most other birds, ostriches are not timid, delicate, or easily startled. These bold, sturdy creatures hold their ground when challenged. They’re agile runners and masterful fighters with a host of fascinating adaptations. Simply put, ostriches are the biggest, baddest birds in the world.",882.0
" Until then, scientists didn’t even know Uranus had a magnetic field!
When the Uranus flyby went well, NASA sent Voyager 2 to Neptune as well. It reached the planet in August of 1989. There, it discovered five new moons. The largest moon, Triton, had geyser-like eruptions of dust and gas. Then, like Voyager 1, Voyager 2 began its journey toward interstellar space.
Gathering information is only part of the Voyagers’ mission. They are also carrying information out of the solar system—a message to non-Earth life forms, or aliens. The message is on a twelve-inch “Golden Record” on the side of each spacecraft. The record includes music, art, and spoken greetings from around the world. It also includes sounds from nature. The outside of the record has a map showing Earth’s location in the universe. Aliens could use it to find Earth, but that probably won’t happen anytime soon. Voyager 1 won’t come close to another star for at least forty thousand years. Neither spacecraft will come close to another planet for millions of years.
Now that the Voyagers have finished exploring planets, they have a new job: the Interstellar Mission. They are the first probes to explore space beyond our solar system. In August 2012, Voyager 1 left our solar system and began this new journey.
“The Voyager mission has opened up our solar system in a way not possible before the Space Age,” says Voyager project scientist Dr. Edward Stone. The two spacecraft ended up exploring all of the solar system’s giant outer planets and forty-eight of their moons. Now the Voyagers are giving us a glimpse of interstellar space.

"91 m) tall! Some women had model ships built into their hairstyles. These styles were so hard to create that women would leave them in for months without combing or washing their hair.
The lard used to set these hairstyles would spoil over time. Cockroaches, mice, and even rats would build nests in the hair. Women carried a long stick with a claw on the end. The stick allowed them to scratch inside their hair without ruining their wig. By the eighteenth century, wigs in Western Europe were used by doctors, lawyers, judges and members of the church. Today, judges and lawyers in the United Kingdom courts still wear wigs as part of their uniforms.
Toupees came into fashion then, too. While still ornate and powdered, they had major advantages—they were much cooler and lighter than full wigs. By the 1850s in Europe, many people had stopped wearing wigs. Many of the common people saw them as a luxury only the rich could afford.
Hair Today, Gone Tomorrow?
As technology improved in the twentieth century, people began to create wigs out of nylon threads. Nylon looked like human hair but cost a lot less. It also allowed for more colors, giving people more choices for looks and locks. Today, people continue to wear wigs for many different reasons. They wear them to appear fashionable and stylish or simply to change their appearance. People who are bald or losing their hair may wear wigs to feel better about themselves. Clowns or actors might wear wigs as part of their costumes. Styles have changed, depending on the fashion of the time. Even so, whether they are long or short, fancy or plain, wigs have played an important role in human history. Who knows what the next great fashionable hairstyle will be?",978.0
" Some parts of the Great Plains are flat, and others are hillier.
We stop overnight in western Minnesota and drive into South Dakota the next morning. It’s pretty flat until we get near Badlands National Park. We hike in the park and see some amazing rock formations. After an overnight stay, we drive through a corner of Wyoming and pass the Bighorn Mountains on our left. Some of the mountains have snow, but Mom says even bigger mountains are still to come.
After we cross into Montana and pass Billings, Dad says, “Get ready to be impressed!” Not too long after, I let out a whoop as I see a row of high, snowy peaks—the Rocky Mountains. The Rockies are one of the main mountain ranges in the West. They formed when two small tectonic plates beneath the Pacific Ocean slid under the North American Plate.
After driving across Montana, Idaho, and Washington, I’m excited to see water again. But I’m more excited to see Mount Rainier (ray-NEER), a huge volcano.

" Horseshoe crabs may look odd, but they have adapted to their changing environment and survived for 350 million years—since dinosaurs roamed the Earth.
I immediately assigned myself the role of Chief Rescuer of Valuable Arthropods. Every morning became a rescue mission. I turned over stranded crabs or tossed them back into the waves, if seagulls hadn’t reached them first to eat their tender parts. Sometimes I tossed them from the end of the rock jetty, waved, and wished them “good luck” as they swam away. Many times they’d float back in and become stuck on the shore again, but I soon learned when the waves would take them farther out into the water. I also tried to chase birds away when I saw them eating the eggs. But Gram told me I should leave the birds alone because for many years this had been their way of getting the food they needed on their flight back north.
Early one morning, I walked out to discover everything had changed again. There was not a single horseshoe crab in sight! I ran back to the house to ask what had happened to them. “It’s all right,” Gram said. “The crabs are done laying their eggs. They’ll be back next year.” I was disappointed, but I hoped that I could come back to Gram’s big ocean house again next summer. I walked back to the beach and plopped down onto the warm sand, watching the seagulls circling overhead. My crab rescue campaign had been an exciting new adventure. And, thanks to Gram, I had learned about the ocean environment, helped nature a little, and had seen a whole different way of living.

" The layer of skin also distorts the color of blood and blood vessels.
Bruises also appear purple in color. A bruise occurs when a blood vessel breaks beneath your skin, but your skin doesn’t break. The blood collects under the unbroken skin, giving your skin a purplish hue. White blood cells swarm in to eat the pooling blood and over time, the blood breaks down into smaller and smaller pieces, until eventually the blood under the skin is gone. The bruise, or “black-and-blue mark,” has disappeared.
Not all blood is the same. Blood can be categorized and sorted into four types. A substance called an antigen determines your blood type. Antigens cause your blood to make infection-fighting chemicals. There are two kinds of antigens—A and B. If your blood has the A antigen, you have Type A blood. If your blood has the B antigen, you have Type B blood. If you have both antigens, your blood is Type AB; and if you have neither antigen, your blood is Type O. It is important to know your blood type. If you are ever in an accident and lose a lot of blood you will need a transfusion to replace your lost blood. You can only accept blood from someone who has your blood type or Type O blood. People with Type O blood are called universal donors since anyone can accept their blood.
Have you ever heard the expression that your body is like a well-oiled machine? Well, if that’s true, then your blood is the oil that makes your body run.

All together, your heart, your blood vessels, and your blood make up your body’s circulatory system.",875.0
" New meters monitor moisture in the soil and turn the irrigation on and off automatically, wasting less water. Many fruit and nut orchards now bury irrigation pipes. Buried pipes deliver water closer to the tree roots and waste less water.
Planting different crops can also help conserve groundwater. In states such as Kansas and Iowa, some farms are switching from corn to other crops because corn requires a lot of water. However, corn crops earn more money, so many farmers don’t want to change. Farmers need new ways to farm. If they do not conserve water voluntarily, empty aquifers will one day force them to.
Record drought forced California to conserve water. At one point, cities there could fine people five hundred dollars a day if they failed to follow restrictions on washing cars or watering lawns. As a result, water use there dropped. In just six months, people in California went from using as much as 140 gallons (530 L) per person to just 67 gallons (254 L) a day, on average.
Nationwide, 57 percent of American households rely on groundwater. In rural areas, that figure is more than 90 percent. Fortunately, small changes in plumbing and water use can save hundreds of gallons in the average American home each week. By installing low-flush toilets and taking shorter showers, we can use less groundwater. In addition, property owners can save water by replacing thirsty grass lawns with yards that need less water. The motto in California for letting lawns die is pretty catchy: “Brown is the New Green.” Saving our groundwater isn’t easy. People need to drink. Farmers need to irrigate crops to grow our food. Still, we can be smarter about how we use this resource, both now and far into the future.",986.0
" However, Anthony and her fellow suffragists would all pass away without seeing women’s suffrage come to the United States.
The movement continued with the next generation of suffragists, some of whom believed in big, bold actions to bring attention to their cause. In 1913, suffragist Alice Paul, one of the leaders of NAWSA, helped organize a women’s suffrage parade that took place in Washington, D.C., the day before Woodrow Wilson took the oath of office to become president.
Thousands of women marched in the streets. Many men in the crowd, including some police, tripped, grabbed, shoved, and insulted the women. More than two hundred of those who marched were hurt. Afterward, the newspapers and many in the public criticized the treatment of the women. In 1917, Paul organized a protest in front of the White House. Suffragists, called “silent sentinels,” picketed twenty-four hours a day, six days a week, and carried signs demanding the right to vote. Nearly five hundred silent sentinels, including Alice Paul, were arrested. Some of the women were treated badly in prison. They decided to go on a hunger strike as a way to protest and bring public attention to their treatment. The women gained public sympathy and were released. Support for women’s suffrage was at an all-time high.
In 1918, President Wilson agreed to support a constitutional amendment that granted voting rights to all female citizens. This became the Nineteenth Amendment. Congress passed it in 1919, and it became law on August 26, 1920. On Election Day in 1920, for the first time in U.S. history, women across the country legally voted for president.

In 1993, Mandela shared the Nobel Peace Prize with de Klerk, but his work was not done. Now he worked to bring about free elections.
The country’s first free elections took place in 1994. Thousands of people stood in lines for up to five hours to vote for the first time. Nelson Mandela was elected president of South Africa.
Mandela did not want his country filled with hate and fear over things that had happened in the past, so he helped start the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC). A person could come before the TRC and confess to things he or she had done during apartheid and not be charged with a crime.
Some considered the TRC process unfair; however, it helped bring to light the truth about crimes that happened under apartheid. Those who had suffered under the old laws sometimes discovered what had happened to friends or relatives who had disappeared.
Mandela retired after his first term as president. He finally moved back to his childhood village, but he did not retire from helping his people. He met with world leaders to advance his country and peace around the world, and he started the Nelson Mandela Children’s Fund to help children. After a long illness, he died in 2013.
Mandela’s belief in talking with everyone, rather than just one side, helped to establish a country where all people are treated equally under the law. Today, Nelson Mandela remains a lasting symbol of freedom for all.",1019.0
" “What pains she has taken! I like it so, it—it makes me feel sorrowful.” But the next moment she was mystified. On the underside of the pincushion was secured a card, bearing in neat letters the name “Miss Amelia Minchin.” Sara turned it over and over. “Miss Amelia!” she said to herself. “How can it be!” And just at that very moment she heard the door being cautiously pushed open and saw Becky peeping round it. There was an affectionate, happy grin on her face, and she shuffled forward and stood nervously pulling at her fingers.
“Do yer like it, Miss Sara?” she said. “Do yer?” “Like it?” cried Sara. “You darling Becky, you made it all yourself.” Becky gave a hysteric but joyful sniff, and her eyes looked quite moist with delight. “It ain’t nothin’ but flannin, an’ the flannin ain’t new; but I wanted to give yer somethin’ an’ I made it of nights. I knew yer could pretend it was satin with diamond pins in. I tried to when I was makin’ it. The card, miss,” she went on rather doubtfully; “’t warn’t wrong of me to pick it up out o’ the dustbin, was it? Miss ’Meliar had throwed it away. I hadn’t no card o’ my own, an’ I knowed it wouldn’t be a proper presink if I didn’t pin a card on—so I pinned Miss ’Meliar’s.” Sara flew at her and hugged her. She could not have told herself or anyone else why there was a lump in her throat. “Oh, Becky!” she cried out, with a queer little laugh, “I love you, Becky—I do, I do!” “Oh, miss!” breathed Becky. “Thank yer, miss, kindly; it ain’t good enough for that.

" People around the world held candlelight gatherings to show their support. After she was far along in her recovery, Malala started attending school in Birmingham in March 2013. She and her family are staying in Birmingham, where they hope to be safe from the Taliban. Malala is not happy to be away from the Swat Valley or her friends. However, she can’t go back, at least for now. The area is still too dangerous, and the Taliban are still targeting her.
In July 2013, Malala gave a speech at the United Nations, less than one year after the attack. She called for children around the world to be permitted to get an education. Later that year, Malala received Europe’s top human rights award for her dedication to freedom of thought and human rights. She has met with President Obama, the Queen of England, and other world figures.
In October 2014, Malala was chosen to receive the Nobel Peace Prize. At age seventeen, she was the youngest person ever given that honor. Malala said the award made her feel “more powerful and courageous.” She dedicated her award to “all those children who are voiceless,” saying, “My message to children around the world is: stand up for your rights.” The Taliban tried to silence Malala, but instead they made her voice carry even more loudly. She continues to support every child’s right to an education and refuses to be silenced by fear. Malala’s goal is to someday become Pakistan’s prime minister. Her father is now a Special Advisor on Global Education for the United Nations. Malala and her father continue to work together, guided by their vision of a peaceful world and an education for every child.",968.0
" He made fun of how she looked and how she dressed. He insisted that she never understood DNA because she disagreed with him. In reality, she never said anything until she was absolutely sure it was true. Jim was the opposite; he loved to talk about his ideas, even if he couldn’t prove them.
Before he published his book, Jim Watson showed it to other people. Maurice Wilkins, Francis Crick, and Linus Pauling all urged him not to write about Rosalind the way he had because it was mean and untrue. Jim didn’t want to change his story, so he added one paragraph at the end, saying that he didn’t believe those terrible things anymore. He admitted that he and Francis wouldn’t have understood DNA without Rosalind and that she had to work twice as hard just because she was a woman. Most people who knew Rosalind did not think this one paragraph did her justice. Partly because of the awful things Jim Watson wrote, Rosalind got more famous. Today, more people honor Rosalind and her work. In 1984, Cambridge opened the Rosalind Franklin Design, Technology, and Engineering Workshop. In 2000, King’s College named a new lab the Franklin-Wilkins Building after her and Maurice. Books and movies have also been made about her life.
Rosalind never set out to prove that women made great scientists—she just knew that she loved her work. Sometimes she resented people standing in her way, and sometimes she argued when it might have been better to compromise, but nothing ever kept her from doing her job. Even when she was sick, she kept working until the end of her life. Her determination to do her work well, even in the face of discrimination, led to one of the most important discoveries in the history of science.",1017.0
" The light comes from a special process called bioluminescence. This is the same process that makes light in fireflies. Jellyfish, squid, fish, and even bacteria are bioluminescent in this zone. Since there is no sunlight, this light makes it possible for animals to see and communicate with each other. The light also helps them find mates and food.
Some oceanographers divide the midnight zone into two more zones: the abyssal zone and ocean trenches. The abyssal zone is totally dark. It covers much of the ocean floor, including vast plains, mountains, valleys, and canyons. Ocean trenches are found along faults where large plates of the Earth’s crust come together. The colliding plates create canyons and cracks of up to 10,000 meters (32,808 ft) deep. You would think that nothing could survive in the darkness, cold, and extreme pressure at the bottom of a trench. Openings at the bottom of the trenches spew hot water and minerals from deep within the Earth. Animals living in this zone rely on the warmth and nutrients. Special kinds of bacteria can use these nutrients in the same way that phytoplankton use sunlight. Tube worms, shrimp, and giant clams can all be found feeding on these bacteria around the openings, or chimneys. These chimneys were only recently discovered. Only a few submarines have been built strong enough to withstand the enormous pressure at the bottom of a trench.
So you see, even though phytoplankton are only at the top of the ocean, we’re at the center of the food web, supporting all other life in the sea. Whether you enjoy the ocean for the beauty of coral reefs, the mystery of the abyssal zone, or some tasty fish and chips, you have us phytoplankton to thank.",1001.0
" He also changed construction plans. The original plan called for workers to dig the canal at sea level. To do that, they would have to dig through the mountains, which would add years to the project. A river that ran high along the mountains was also an obstacle. To solve these problems, Stevens proposed building a series of locks—each more than three football fields long—over the mountains. Stevens also decided to dam the river and create a huge lake. He said the locks would allow ships to sail to the top of the mountain and on to the new lake. Another series of locks would lower ships down the mountain range to the ocean below. Stevens directed the workers to dig from both ends and meet in the middle. Building these monster locks took four years. Each lock was 70 feet (21.3 m) deep and 110 feet (33.5 m) wide.
When workers finished the canal in 1914, the locks worked better than anyone had dreamed. The United States controlled the canal until the end of 1999, when Panama took it over as part of a treaty agreement. By the early twenty-first century, the canal was showing its age. It badly needed a makeover to allow it to handle larger ships and resolve the problem of traffic jams. In 2006, the people of Panama voted to build two new sets of locks and two new navigation lanes to connect those locks to the existing channels. In 2016, forty-thousand workers completed the $5.4 billion, ten-year construction project. The new locks allow much larger ships to pass through the canal, effectively doubling the amount of cargo it can handle each day. The expansion is yet another marvel of engineering in the canal’s long history.",976.0
" “We will do that gladly,” returned the tiger; and all the other beasts roared with a mighty roar: “We will!”
“Where is this great spider of yours now?” asked the Lion. “Yonder, among the oak trees,” said the tiger, pointing with his forefoot. “Take good care of these friends of mine,” said the Lion, “and I will go at once to fight the monster.” He bade his comrades good-bye and marched proudly away to do battle with the enemy. The great spider was lying asleep when the Lion found him, and it looked so ugly that its foe turned up his nose in disgust. Its legs were quite as long as the tiger had said, and its body covered with coarse black hair. It had a great mouth, with a row of sharp teeth a foot long; but its head was joined to the pudgy body by a neck as slender as a wasp’s waist. This gave the Lion a hint of the best way to attack the creature, and as he knew it was easier to fight it asleep than awake, he gave a great spring and landed directly upon the monster’s back. Then, with one blow of his heavy paw, all armed with sharp claws, he knocked the spider’s head from its body. Jumping down, he watched it until the long legs stopped wiggling, when he knew it was quite dead.
The Lion went back to the opening where the beasts of the forest were waiting for him and said proudly: “You need fear your enemy no longer.” Then the beasts bowed down to the Lion as their King, and he promised to come back and rule over them as soon as Dorothy was safely on her way to Kansas.",828.0
" When the ghost ship was found the next day, the second crew had disappeared as well. The USS Cyclops disappeared in 1918. This is one of the earliest incidents linked to the Bermuda Triangle. In 1966, Captain Donald Henry’s tug, the Good News, was towing a cargo barge from Puerto Rico to Florida. When a dense fog suddenly swirled around the barge, the Good News lost the use of all of its instruments and partially lost power. For five minutes, the ship struggled in a tug-of-war with the fog bank; it finally managed to pull itself and the barge free. People claim that a mysterious power causes the many losses of ships and crews in the Bermuda Triangle. Some people think that UFOs capture humans and take them away. Others say the unexplained losses are a result of the severe weather common in the area. Any vessel that is destroyed would sink without a trace. After being rescued, some of the missing crews tell stories of being forced to leave their storm-damaged ships. Some insist that nothing unusual is going on in the area. They suggest that some of the losses blamed on the Bermuda Triangle actually happened several hundred miles away. Sometimes vessels that have been reported lost appeared later. Do you think the Bermuda Triangle is real or a hoax?

" This stone often has pretty spots and streaks running through it. Much of the world’s turquoise is set in silver, as the Navajo Native Americans traditionally wore it. The Navajo believed turquoise to be pieces of the sky that had fallen to Earth. Natural pearls are strangely shaped and extremely rare. It takes an oyster many years to create a pearl from a tiny bit of sand. Almost all of the beautiful round pearls in jewelry stores are cultured, or made by people. Pearl farmers insert a round shell bead into an oyster’s shell. The oyster covers the bead with nacre, creating a perfectly round pearl. Cultured pearls come in every color of the rainbow, from creamy white to pink to yellow to green and even black. Gemologists are scientists who study the chemical composition of gemstones. Sometimes gemologists are experts in a particular gemstone, such as diamonds or rubies. Gemologists who work in the laboratory can often identify which area of the world a particular gem came from by studying its chemical composition. They can also tell the difference between natural and synthetic gems by studying clues inside the gems themselves that give information about how the gem was formed.
Beautiful gems can be found around the world. Many gems symbolize power and wealth. For centuries, people have killed and died for them. In some places, such as West Africa and Colombia, the gem trade is still filled with blood and violence. Mining gems with dynamite and strip mines is often dangerous, damaging both humans and the Earth. Scientists can grow gems in the lab that are identical to the finest natural gems but cost a thousand times less. In the future, created gems might help fill our desire for gemstones’ beauty while preserving Earth and its people.",1012.0
" If you did the math, you’d understand that.” “If you’re such a hot-shot, Math-head, then throw the next one over the plate.” “Okay,” said Miltie. The minus side of playing for dibs in our special, secret baseball league is that if you talk about what happens, then adults and other people will end up knowing about it. Then there would be trophies and names in newspapers, and marching at the head of the parade wouldn’t mean that much. So we never talk about what happens, and that’s too bad, especially when what happens is the stuff of legends. So, even if you live near Cobb County, you probably won’t hear how Miltie, being a straight- up guy, did exactly what he told 618 he’d do. He fired a strike right over the plate. He just didn’t throw the type of strike 618 was expecting. You see, Miltie threw his fastball. I still think Jimmy could have run from the mound to the plate faster than the pitch, yet compared to the bloopers Miltie had been throwing, his fastball actually seemed fast. The 618 Express, laying back for the blooper with his bat held low, simply couldn’t adjust his swing in time to catch up with Miltie’s fastball.

We were going to lead the Founder’s Day parade all because of Miltie Math-head. “Miltie, Miltie, Miltie,” the team shouted, as we carried him around the bases in a victory lap. “Thanks, but I couldn’t have done it without all of you,” said Miltie, his ego looking just about the right size again. “And, of course, math,” I added. “Actually, Dan, this time I used psychology—there’s a lot more to pitching than just throwing strikes.”",915.0
" Leave the firefighting to the firefighters. • Before evacuating, close all your windows and ask an adult to turn off any gas lines. • Make sure there are no flammable materials such as piles of brush, leaves, or garbage near your home. Store firewood away from your home. • Ask your parents to make sure your roof and gutters are kept clean and free of debris.
• Ask your parents if they can get a fire-retardant layer built onto the roof. Often, wildfires throw large sparks into the air, and the falling sparks can set fire to roofs miles away from the fire. • During extremely dry periods when fire danger is high, have your parents consider removing brush and trees that grow close to your home. These plants are much easier to replace than your home. If you visit wilderness areas, be sure you follow these steps for preventing wildfires. • Always follow posted rules for building campfires. If fires are not allowed, do not build one, even if you think it’s safe. • Always have a grownup build and watch your campfire. Never leave a campfire unattended. • Build a safe fire. Clear any debris away from the fire pit or fireplace. Make sure the outside of the fire is lined with at least two layers of rocks. Keep your extra firewood away from the fire. • Always keep a large bucket of water and a shovel near a campfire. Put out stray sparks with water or a shovelful of moist dirt. • Put your fire out with plenty of water. Make sure you stir the ashes so the water can get to every burning bit. Carefully feel over the ground to make sure there’s no heat left.",930.0
" They invited Philip’s son, Prince Louis of France, to join the fight. They intended to put Louis on the English throne once they were victorious. Louis raised an army and invaded England. In late 1216, there was a completely unexpected development: both Pope Innocent and King John died. John’s nine-year-old son, Henry III, then became king. Marshal, now aged seventy, became the administrator of the government because Henry was still too young to rule on his own. Marshal advised Henry to reissue the charter to show the barons that he would be a law-abiding king.
Marshal once again proved his worth to the English throne. In 1217, he defeated the rebel barons and sent Prince Louis back to France. Henry reissued the Great Charter, satisfying the barons who worried that his reign would not be much different from John’s. Henry turned eighteen in 1225. That year, he again reissued the Great Charter, thereby reinforcing his promise to be a good ruler. Henry accepted the idea that even the king of England must obey the law. The charter was reissued one more time, in 1297, during the reign of Henry’s son, King Edward I.
The Great Charter became a powerful symbol of freedom and the idea that no one is above the law. It served as the foundation for English Common Law, England’s legal system. According to the charter, people charged with a crime must be treated as innocent until proven guilty in a trial by jury. Many of the ideas presented in the charter deeply influenced political thinking in Europe. They also influenced the American colonies in the 1700s, when they broke away from British rule to create the United States. Many of those same ideas found new expression in the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights.",1050.0

" With seven billion people on Earth, we’d need three or four more planets for everyone to live like most people in the United States. Rich countries can share Earth’s resources more fairly, though, in order to lower the global birthrate.
Everyone in the world can have enough to eat if people in rich countries eat smarter and waste less. For example, grain is the world’s most important source of food. Yet as meat production has boomed for rich and developing countries, a third of the grain grown worldwide is used to feed livestock. It takes between 11 pounds (4.99 kg) and 16 pounds (7.25 kg) of grain to create 1 pound (0.45 kg) of meat. Eating less meat means more grain for people in poor countries and protection of valuable grasslands. Average Americans use 3 times the food and 250 times the fresh water needed to survive. They can reduce their ecological footprint by eating smarter, recycling, and using less energy. Americans are the world’s biggest consumers. They could instead be the world’s most efficient consumers if they make intelligent choices about how to live.
The Rapanui left records on carved tablets, but no one can translate the ancient language today.

Yet gradually he mustered force to put the sin at a distance. And at last his eyes seemed to open to some new ways. He found that he could look back upon the brass and bombast of his earlier gospels and see them truly. He was gleeful when he discovered that he now despised them. With this conviction came a store of assurance. He felt a quiet manhood, nonassertive but of sturdy and strong blood. He knew that he would no more quail before his guides wherever they should point. He had been to touch the great death, and found that, after all, it was but the great death. He was a man. So it came to pass that as he trudged from the place of blood and wrath his soul changed. He came from hot plowshares to prospects of clover tranquilly, and it was as if hot plowshares were not. Scars faded as flowers. It rained. The procession of weary soldiers became a bedraggled train, despondent and muttering, marching with churning effort in a trough of liquid brown mud under a low, wretched sky.
Yet the youth smiled, for he saw that the world was a world for him, though many discovered it to be made of oaths and walking sticks. He had rid himself of the red sickness of battle.

" A young panda’s biggest dangers are leopards and wild dogs.
A panda is an adult by the age of three, and it can fend for itself without its mother. It settles in an area called a home range, where it feeds alone. Each panda gives other pandas signs to keep away from its home range. One sign is a smelly liquid that the panda releases from its body and rubs on tree trunks. A panda also marks the edges of its home range by scratching the bark of tree trunks.
Female pandas usually remain solitary in their home range. Males roam more widely and are more aware of their neighbors. When it is time to mate, males know where to find females and where to find their male rivals. Males fight for the right to mate with a female by pushing and bumping each other in a sort of panda sumo-wrestling match.
Giant pandas are in great danger of becoming extinct. No one is sure how many are left because they are hard to locate and study, but scientists believe that only about 1,000 giant pandas are still alive in the wild. The biggest threat to pandas is the destruction of their forest homes. China’s population is growing fast, and bamboo forests are being cleared for wood and farmland. Pandas are also in danger from hunters who want to sell their coats. Pandas are easy targets because they move slowly. The Chinese government now has strict laws to protect pandas, and it has created thirty- four preserves to protect their habitat.
Many zoos now have panda breeding programs in which scientists are studying how to help pandas survive in the wild. Concerned people around the world are working hard to keep giant pandas alive.",940.0

In 1965, a group of Filipino farm workers went on strike against the grape growers in Delano, California. They were asking for a pay raise from $.90 an hour to $1.40 an hour. Chavez knew he had to support the Filipino strikers. His organization voted to join the strike. Soon, more than 2,000 migrants stopped working. Strikers and their families went to cities all across North America, telling people about the working conditions of the grape pickers and asking them to boycott grapes. More than 14 million Americans did just that.
Angry grape growers made threats on Chavez’s life. Support for the boycott continued, though, and after five long years, the grape growers agreed to the union’s demands.
Other strikes and boycotts followed, not just in California but also in Texas. New unions formed in the Midwest. In 1975, California finally passed a law that protected farm workers from being fired when they tried to unite. Against all odds, Chavez’s efforts had succeeded. At its height, his organization, the United Farm Workers, included 50,000 farm workers. “We shall be heard,” Chavez said, and they were.
Cesar Chavez died in his sleep on April 23, 1993. He was 66 years old. Thousands of farm workers and supporters came to his funeral. It was the largest funeral for any labor leader in the history of the United States. He was a humble and courageous man who spent his life helping others. For all his work to improve wages and working conditions for farm workers, Chavez himself never earned more than $6,000 per year. Still, as he said, “The rich may have money, but the poor have time.” His fight for the dignity of all people inspired millions of Americans to work for social justice around the world.",939.0
" “Not yet,” my mother replied. I got out of the car and stood by it for a second. “Come on, Mary,” Mom said, motioning me forward. I went onto the porch and shook Harry’s hand, not wanting to admit to myself that he sort of had a nice smile. “Nice to finally meet you, Mary,” he said. “Are you ready for your surprise?” I waited for a moment, not reacting until I could figure out what was going on.
“Emily!” he called into the house. No one had told me about meeting anyone else. I looked to my mom, who smiled nervously. I thought maybe Emily was a new puppy Harry had bought to make me like him, but then a girl stepped from behind the door. She was about my height, with brown hair and the same neat little nose as Harry. There was a tense moment when we all stood still, Mom and Harry waiting while Emily stood with both arms behind her back, holding one elbow with the opposite hand. From the look on Emily’s face, I knew that Harry had given her exactly the same speech that my mother had given me. He hoped she would be nice and get along so the two of them could continue being happy together. I wasn’t sure about the idea of Mom and Harry getting married, but Emily and I were in the same boat—there was no reason for us not to be friends.

" A female whale gives birth every two or three years. Baby blue whales, called calves, weigh more than 5,000 pounds (2,268 kg) when they are born. Within minutes of birth, a calf swims to the surface with its mother for air. The calf and its mother have a strong bond. They remain together for many months while the calf drinks milk and gains over 200 pounds (90.7 kg) a day. After about a year, it leaves its mother and becomes independent.
Blue whales are not only the largest animals in the world, they are also the loudest. These whales can produce sounds louder than a jet engine! Whale “songs” can travel for miles through the water. Even though whale sounds are loud, they are impossible for people to hear without special equipment. Some scientists think whales use sonar to help them find their way through dark ocean waters, much the way bats navigate. Other scientists think whales sing to communicate with each other. Scientists do know that only male whales sing. They have also discovered that whales in different parts of the world sing slightly different songs.
Whale songs are just one of the behaviors of blue whales that scientists hope to better understand. Much is still unknown about the habits of these enormous creatures. In the early to mid-twentieth century, so many blue whales were hunted that they were nearly driven to extinction. Their numbers have only slightly recovered since then. As an endangered species, blue whales are protected by the International Whaling Commission. Despite these efforts, it is estimated that only ten to twenty-five thousand of these magnificent creatures survive today. Scientists continue their research, hoping to acquire new knowledge about these gentle giants to help ensure their survival for many generations to come.",971.0

If you visit Central and South America, you’ll get a real taste of Latino culture. Latin cooking can be spicy because people often use many kinds of chili peppers to flavor it. Recipes feature roasted meats, local seafood, beans, rice, tomatoes, and potatoes. Quick meals can be wrapped up in a tortilla, a thin, flat, fried made with flour or ground cornmeal.
And do you know what treat was discovered in Mexico? Chocolate! Chocolate comes from the beans of the cacao tree. The Aztecs, the native people of Mexico, crushed cacao beans to make a rich, bitter chocolate drink. Mexico spent several centuries under foreign rule by Spain and France. These rulers brought royal cooks, and their recipes, with them to Mexico. The rulers left, but the recipes stayed. Today, in larger Mexican cities, you can still find elegant restaurants that serve formal, French-style cuisine.
You can get almost any type of food you want in the United States—Mexican, Chinese, Japanese, Italian, African, or anything else. Just as in other countries we’ve visited, each region in the United States has its own favorite dishes. Coastal areas may feature seafood, such as a fish stew called cioppino (cha-PEE-no), created in San Francisco. Mountainous regions may offer wild game recipes. Barbecued ribs and corn on the cob are favorites nearly everywhere, and almost everyone loves apple pie and ice cream!
Discovering new foods is like going to another country for a few hours. Learning about the country’s foods is part of learning about its culture. So visit the library or explore online to learn more. Try new restaurants or foods with your family. Learning about new foods and flavors from other places can be fun. Who knows, you might decide to become a world-famous cook!",954.0
"” “No,” José said out loud, lowering his rifle. The deer surely heard him, for it swiveled its ears around until all of its senses focused on the tree stand, alert and confused, before it jogged away. “Are you angry with me?” José asked his “No, José, I’m not,” he replied. “In fact, I did the very same thing the first time I went out hunting with my father.” José felt relieved. “Really?” he said.
“I have a lot of time to think when I’m out here alone in the tree stand, and I’ve decided something about hunting. When we buy meat at the supermarket, we never see the animal it comes from,” his father explained.
“But when we hunt, we see the animal, and we shoot the animal, and we take it home and eat its meat. It’s more than just eating—it’s an interaction between one person and one animal,” his father continued. “And sometimes the animal looks at you, and you know you shouldn’t shoot it. Sometimes I feel proud to get a buck, like I’ve won a race or I’m a cougar that caught its prey. But sometimes I feel like you just felt, and I’m glad you have that sense, too. If you shoot even when your heart tells you not to, that means you’re killing without caring, without paying attention to the interaction between you and the animal. Some people never shoot, and some people don’t think hunting is right at all, and that’s okay, too.” José inhaled deeply and relaxed for the first time all morning. His father took out the Thermos again, popped the cup off the top, filled it, and handed it to José. “You want me to drink coffee?” José asked. “It’s hot cocoa,” his father answered. “I brought it for you.”",828.0

For the 2006 Little League World Series, teams from as far away as Saudi Arabia and Russia made it to Williamsport in late August. Kawaguchi City, Japan, won the International Championship over Matamoros, Mexico, by a score of 3–0. Japan’s star player, Go Matsumoto, hit a home run and was brought in as a relief pitcher to get his team out of a bases-loaded, no- outs bind. In the U.S. Championship game, the team from Columbus, Georgia, defeated the Beaverton, Oregon, team 7–3. It was up to Georgia to carry the banner of the United States against Japan in the World Series Championship game. And carry it, they did.
Georgia’s pitching phenom Kyle Carter struck out eleven batters and gave up only three hits. Matsumoto’s pitching kept the game close, but the Georgia team won to take the series for the United States for the second year in a row. It was quite a feat as the Kawaguchi City team had been undefeated.
The Little League World Series continues to grow and change. More than 300,000 people attended tournament games in 2006, and the games were televised around the United States. When second baseman Josh Lester of Columbus, Georgia, fielded the last out of the championship game, the crowd broke into cheers and chanted, “USA! USA!”
In true Little League spirit, the Georgia team members asked the Kawaguchi City players to join them in a victory lap around the field. This proves that Little League’s goal remains the same after decades of growth: to provide a game that teaches players the principles they should use as good citizens of the world. “Ladies and Gentlemen, boys and girls, we’ll see you next year for another exciting Little League World Series!”",1142.0
" But people have never lost interest in lighter-than-air flight. Probably the most famous airships of all are the Goodyear blimps. In the 1930s, Goodyear teamed up with the Zeppelin Company to build zeppelins and blimps for the U.S. Navy. Goodyear also made some blimps to use for advertising its products and hasn’t stopped since. Goodyear blimps are seen by millions of people every year. Other companies, such as Fuji Film and Metropolitan Life, also use blimps to promote their products.
In Germany, where the zeppelin was invented, interest in new airships is very strong. The Zeppelin Company is once again building airships. Their new ship is the Zeppelin NT (New Technology). It is designed for many different uses, including patrol, exploration, advertising, and passenger travel. For the first time in almost 70 years, you can buy a ticket for an airship flight. The company that once flew the Graf Zeppelin now offers sightseeing trips over Germany.
Other companies have started to build airships, as well. Lockheed Martin, for example, has the Hybrid Airship. This ship can be used to carry very heavy and bulky cargo. It will be able to pick up its load at the factory and drop it right where it’s needed, especially places that do not have decent roads.
Once people realized that air could be made lighter by heating it and that there were gases lighter than air, they looked for ways to float objects in the air. First it was hot air balloons. Then came dirigibles that could be steered. These airships got bigger and better. They became dependable, safe means to travel through the air. Dirigibles still fascinate and excite people 150 years after they were invented.",975.0
" Compound microscopes also allowed scientists to discover that salt, sugar, and some other things in nature form crystal structures. Salt is made up of only two types of regularly spaced particles. As a result, it forms crystals shaped like little cubes. Table sugar is made up of two different, simpler types of sugar. It forms crystals that are slanted at each end and longer than salt crystals.
Seeing the world’s tiny details can help people understand how things work. For example, a man named George de Mestral became curious about the cockleburs that stuck to his clothing and his dog’s fur. He took a closer look at the burrs under a microscope. He saw that they had tiny hooks that latched onto loops in the fabric of his pants. De Mestral worked to recreate the design using fabric. Years later, the result was Velcro. Velcro is made up of two pieces of fabric, one covered in thousands of tiny hooks and the other covered in thousands of tiny loops. The hooks and loops let the two pieces of fabric “zip” together.
Magnified One Million Times (1,000,000x)
Because of the way light works, there is a limit to how much a compound microscope can magnify things. During the past century, scientists developed microscopes that use different ways to create images. One such microscope uses energy called electrons. Electron microscopes provide the greatest magnification of any existing type of microscope, magnifying samples up to one million times (1,000,000x)!
With each new power of magnification, more detail is revealed about the smallest structures of plants, animals, and materials. As a result, microscopes have allowed countless discoveries in nearly every field of science. Microscopes make the invisible visible, allowing us to explore the world in an entirely new way.",1029.0
" They were passed after the Civil War (1861–1865). The Thirteenth Amendment outlawed slavery in the United States. The Fourteenth Amendment made all former slaves U.S. citizens. Another important amendment was the Nineteenth Amendment. It gave women the right to vote. Women fought for this right for more than seventy years before the amendment passed in 1920. Amendments can only be suggested by Congress or when called for by two-thirds of the states. Once suggested, three-quarters of the states must vote in favor of the amendment for it to become law.
The Bill of Rights and other amendments to the Constitution guarantee the rights of all Americans, but sometimes people have to fight to keep their rights. Alondra Jones was a top student at a public high school, but she struggled to graduate. Her high school didn’t have enough textbooks to go around, and there were no computers for students to use. The buildings were filthy and filled with rats. One day, Alondra visited another school where students had books, computers, and clean, safe buildings. That trip helped Alondra understand that her school was very different from many other schools in her state. Alondra decided to stand up for her rights. She joined almost one hundred other students in a lawsuit that changed the way her state funded its public schools. The court that decided the case said that the state was not giving “equal protection” to its students as required by the Fourteenth Amendment.
The story of individual rights in America continues to change through new laws, new amendments, and the actions of citizens who are willing to stand up for their rights. The Founders of the United States created a system that promised liberty and freedom to its citizens. It is up to all Americans to keep that promise alive.",1020.0
" Sewage piled up all over the city. There were too many people and too much waste! People’s homes had a privy or outhouse, which was sometimes just a hole in the ground. Since there was no way to flush, human waste would pile up in the hole. When the privy was full, a night-soil man came to remove the backed-up waste. He came at night so people would not have to see him hauling buckets to the street and dumping them in his horse-drawn cart to be taken away. When the night-soil man’s cart was full, he would usually dump it in the nearest river. Sometimes the shorelines became so thick with poop that they had to be dug out before ships could dock!
As if dumping poop into local rivers wasn’t bad enough, some of the night-soil men got lazy. They dumped their carts into the streets. Some people would allow their privies to overflow and wash into the streets. There were no storm sewers back then for the waste to wash down, so it would pile up where people walked and children played. The stench was unbearable.
In the mid-1800s, experts began to realize that streets flowing with waste were also flowing with deadly diseases. New York began building sewer systems so the waste would have somewhere to go. By 1914, New York City had nearly 850 miles (1,368 km) of sewers. These laid the foundation for our modern sewage treatment systems. Today in the United States, most people take the sewerage system for granted. Waste disappears down toilets and sinks as if by magic, but now you know how it really works. So, the next time you flush, take a moment to appreciate the wonders of the modern sewerage system!",960.0
" Lily talked with her mother and also spoke with her school’s counselor. She was uncomfortable asking the counselor to talk with the other girls and didn’t want to be called a tattletale. Still, her teacher and the counselor know about the problem, and Lily says she will go back to them for help if needed. Lily has learned to speak up for herself and isn’t afraid to tell others when their actions hurt her feelings. Gardner has also asked his teachers for help, although each year his different teachers have given different amounts of attention to the problem. On the playground, Gardner tries to ignore or avoid the bullies. He plays on the opposite side of the schoolyard, stays near adult supervisors, and tries to walk away anytime the bullies get too close. After a meeting between teachers, Gardner, and the group of boys who bully him, school leaders divided up the playground in order to keep the boys away from Gardner—and from the other students the boys bully.
Gardner’s grandmother, whom he lives with, talked to the school principal, who responded by keeping the ringleader of the group inside during lunch breaks and recess for a month. That helped, but only temporarily, Gardner says.
Gardner says he tries to focus on himself and his classwork so that he doesn’t give the bullies any attention or power. He’s also taking martial arts classes to develop strength and confidence. “It makes me feel more disciplined and proud of myself,” he says. “I feel like I’m not as weak.” He says he tries to treat everyone the way he wants to be treated—with fairness and kindness. That’s something he learned from his grandmother. “In our family, we talk about treating people with respect,” Gardner says.",1062.0

By the Civil War, Douglass was the most famous black man in the United States. In 1863, he served as President Lincoln’s advisor on the Emancipation Proclamation, an order that freed the majority of slaves. He repeatedly urged Lincoln to make emancipation a stated goal of the war. Some historians think Douglass helped inspire the famous Gettysburg Address. Douglass also convinced Lincoln to allow black soldiers to fight for the North. When they did, two of Douglass’s sons were among them.
Douglass’s writing and speaking helped end slavery with the Thirteenth Amendment, passed after the Civil War ended in 1865. Three years later, the Fourteenth Amendment granted citizenship to former slaves. Shortly after that, in 1870, the Fifteenth Amendment gave every male citizen, including former slaves, the right to vote. Douglass didn’t live to see universal suffrage—the right of every adult to vote—but he fought for it until he died. In 1920, the states ratified the Nineteenth Amendment, granting women the right to vote.
Douglass wanted the United States to reach its potential as a “land of the free” for blacks, women, Native Americans, and immigrants, too. “I would unite with anybody to do right and with nobody to do wrong,” Douglass said. He continued to fight for equality for the rest of his life. Douglass died on February 20, 1895. Today, Douglass is often called the father of the civil rights movement. He changed the way Americans thought about slavery and race. He left behind words to continue to inspire Americans, including this motto: “Right is of no sex, truth is of no color.”",984.0
" Even more deadly were new illnesses brought by Europeans for which Polynesians had no resistance or cure. Native Hawaiians were nearly wiped out by disease starting in the late 1700s. Their islands, though, remained under their own control until 1893. Their queen, Liliuokalani, was then overthrown by the United States. Hawaii remained a U.S. territory until 1959, when it became the country’s fiftieth state. Today, native Hawaiians make up about 10 percent of the state’s population.
All around the Pacific, Polynesians became second-class citizens on their own islands. Outsiders took their lands and pushed aside their traditions. In some instances, language, traditional religion, and other cultural practices were banned. Since the 1960s, however, respect for Polynesian culture has grown. Many Polynesian islands have become popular with tourists because of their natural beauty and cultural traditions. From wood carving to dancing to surfing to fashion, Polynesian culture is now recognized and celebrated around the world. People with Polynesian ancestry have also made their mark on the world. Examples include Hawaii’s Daniel Akaka, the first U.S. senator of native Hawaiian ancestry. There are also wrestler and actor Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson (Samoan) and football star Mike Iupati (Samoan). Actress Auli’i Cravalho (Hawaiian) voices the title character in the movie Moana.
Today, Polynesian peoples are proudly taking back their heritage. Their young people are again learning old traditions, arts, and other parts of their culture.

" Scientists are even planning a solar furnace that will float in space and send focused solar energy back to Earth.
Passive solar homes have special features to collect energy from the Sun. These homes have large windows that face the south in the parts of the world north of the equator. They face north in areas south of the equator. During the colder winter months when the Sun is lower in the sky, sunlight passes through the windows and changes to heat when it is absorbed by walls inside the house.
As important as the Sun is to our survival, it also poses dangers to humans. We are learning more and more about how solar energy damages our skin. A skin cancer, called melanoma, is caused by overexposure to the Sun’s harmful ultraviolet rays. Years of exposure and severe sunburns can damage skin cells. It is important to wear sunscreen and clothing that covers your skin when you are out in the Sun, especially for long periods of time.
Each day fusion changes more and more of the Sun’s hydrogen fuel into helium. Scientists estimate that the Sun has about five billion years of fuel left before it will begin to cool down and eventually die.
We depend on the Sun for our survival. It is the source of most of the energy we use every day. Scientists are working hard to better understand the Sun and its energy. Satellites orbiting Earth collect data from the Sun. Better solar telescopes being developed on Earth are aimed at the Sun to collect data. As we understand the Sun better and find new ways to use its energy, we will grow even more dependent on the power of the Sun.",999.0
" The girl rises like a human kite, 61 meters (200 ft) into the sky.
The boat moving forward provides thrust, the power to take off. The air rushing into the parachute provides lift. As long as the towrope stays tight, the flyer sits back and enjoys the ride —and the admiration of all those watching from the ground.
When towing a parasailor, the speedboat cruises between 24 and 48 kph (15–30 mph). It needs to go fast enough to create lift but not so fast that a wave will make it lose control. When turning, or if a strong gust of wind blows from behind, the boat needs to speed up. Slack in the towrope will cause the parasail to fall. Parasailing is not recommended when the wind is blowing stronger than 24 kph (15 mph).
The height a flyer reaches depends on the speed of the boat and length of the towrope. On average, recreational parasailors reach the height of a 20-story building; maximum height is 183 meters (600 ft) over oceans and 91 meters (300 ft) over large lakes and bays. Some special-attraction parasail rides can go as high as 305 meters (1,000 ft).
Unlike hang gliding and skydiving, para-sailing has no minimum age requirement. There is no special training for the parasailor, though the boat driver needs to have experience. There are many ways to parasail. Strap on a harness or sit in a specially designed chair. Ride alone or with a friend. Parasailing is usually done on oceans, lakes, and bays. Flyers take off from the shore from a barge in the water or from a boat equipped with a winch. Rides from parasailing companies typically last around 10 minutes and can cost $50 or more. A basic parasail, plus accessories, can cost $1,000 and up.",938.0
" One night when I was camping alone on a treeless mountaintop, strong winds and heavy rain caused my tent to collapse. I became frustrated and afraid. At 3:00 a.m., I gave up trying to sleep and decided to pack my belongings, eat breakfast, and start hiking. What followed was the most amazing sunrise I had ever seen, all alone on a mountaintop. I had faced a challenge that at first seemed impossible but over time became something incredible. Many people have asked me, “How did you do it?” I tell them that I hiked the entire Appalachian Trail the same way you do anything else: one step at a time. People have also asked me, “Why did you do it?”
Looking back, the reasons I kept going were different from my reasons when I began. I felt so surrounded by love and support from those around me and at home that I never really wanted to stop. I’m writing this book several months after finishing my thru-hike. My knees still hurt from those five million steps, and I’m not sure how long the pain will continue. I was away from people I love for six months. So you might be wondering, was it worth it? I followed a dream, one step after another, for five million steps. No one can ever take that accomplishment away from me. I left my comfort zone and healed the heaviness in my heart. I planned and saved money and learned to live on a tight budget. I also learned to value every item I carried because my life depended on it. Despite all the challenges, in the end, not only was thru-hiking worth it, it was an invaluable experience.",938.0

What Does “Endangered” Get You?
Meanwhile, scientists have known for decades that the Pacific Northwest’s salmon are in trouble. Every type left in the Columbia River Basin is listed for protection under the Endangered Species Act and has been for years. One of the most important ways the Act can protect species is by protecting their habitat, since a species cannot survive without a home. But the habitat of Columbia River salmon underwent huge changes before the fish were ever listed for protection. So while some argue about how to protect the salmon’s habitat, others insist that the real question ought to be how to restore it.
According to scientists, the best course of action to save the salmon is to take out some dams. According to the Endangered Species Act, if the best science says dams should come down, then dams should come down. But when money and politics are involved, science sometimes gets pushed aside. When that happens, species like the salmon get pushed aside, too.
Some people say it’s a waste of time to talk about whether to pull down the dams. They say most people don’t care enough about the fish to tear them down. So far, this seems to be the case. And so far, a few salmon still make it back to the bend in the river where they were born. They lay their eggs before they die so their whole amazing story can begin again. So far, salmon remain a living legend. If people care enough, salmon can stay that way, instead of becoming the sort of legend that starts, “Once upon a time.”",951.0
" After five months in England, Pocahontas and her family were ready to sail home, but they were delayed by stormy weather. Two months past their planned departure date, they began their trip by sailing down the Thames River. They hadn’t traveled far when Pocahontas became ill.
Pocahontas was taken ashore at Gravesend. She was only around twenty-one years old, but she did not recover. Before she died, she tried to comfort her husband by saying “. . . all must die. ’Tis enough that the child liveth.” No one knows what illness ended Pocahontas’s life. Some experts believe she suffered from a lung disease. Others believe she had dysentery, a contagious infection of the intestines. Pocahontas was buried on March 21, 1617, at St. George’s Church in Gravesend. John Rolfe left England and sailed back to Virginia. He left his son, who was also ill, behind with relatives. Within a year of his daughter’s death, Powhatan also died. With Pocahontas and Chief Powhatan gone, everything changed. It was the end of the peace between the Algonquian tribes and English settlers.
Pocahontas is one of the most famous women of early American history yet we know little about her life. We do know that Pocahontas helped the Jamestown settlers survive. She brought them food when they were starving. She may also have saved the lives of some colonists by warning them of Chief Powhatan’s ambush plans. She cultivated peace between the English newcomers and the Native Americans through both her early friendship with John Smith and her marriage to an English man. Pocahontas continues to fascinate many people. Books, plays, poems, paintings, and movies have featured her. While many stories of Pocahontas contradict one another, most people agree that she played an important role in early American history.",888.0
" They commanded Loki to bring Idun back to Asgard, threatening to kill him if he failed. Loki knew that Thiassi’s lair was located deep in the mountains. Loki couldn’t reach it on foot, so he borrowed a magical cloak of hawk feathers from Freyja—the queen of the goddesses—transformed into a hawk, and flew to the mountains. He found Idun alone in the giant’s house. Thinking quickly, he turned Idun into a nut and flew away, clutching her in his talons. When the giant returned home, he was enraged to discover Idun gone; immediately, he transformed back into an eagle and pursued Loki in his flight. As Loki drew near Asgard, the other gods saw him flying desperately, with the eagle close behind. They stacked up logs and kindling around the outer walls. As Loki flew, exhausted, into the palace, the gods lit the fire. The eagle, who could not stop himself, flew directly into the wall of flames and was killed. So the gods of Asgard regained their youth and defeated the giant.
The Nordic peoples told many stories that illustrated the wisdom of Odin, the trickery of Loki, and the might of Thor. Many legends from Norse mythology, like those told here, are tales of conflict between the gods and the giants. The giants represented the forces of darkness and winter; the gods battled them constantly to restore light, warmth, and growth. Eventually, this conflict culminated in a great battle. At its end, the gods were defeated and the cosmos (including the giants) was destroyed. However, it was reborn thereafter. Some of the gods survived and returned to remake the human race. Norse mythology emphasizes life as a cycle: death and destruction are opportunities to begin anew.",1013.0
" We use numerical base systems when we count certain objects. For example, when counting dozens of eggs, we use base twelve: twelve eggs equal one dozen. When we count time, we use a system devised by the ancient Mesopotamians—base sixty. There are sixty seconds in one minute and sixty minutes in one hour.
Around 3500 BCE, the Sumerians began using a round flat mechanical device to make clay bowls. The potter’s wheel sat horizontally on an axis and, when spun, allowed the potter to make a bowl with even edges and surfaces. It took a while for the Sumerians to realize they could use it as a way to easily move objects and transport people. After much experimenting, the Sumerians tried attaching one wheel to each side of a single axle. The result was a device that made it easy to carry loads. The cart rolled across the ground with minimal effort. Other civilizations copied the invention, and wheels were soon used across the world.
The Akkadian Empire ended in about 2150 BCE after many internal uprisings and an invasion by the Gutians (GOO-tee-uhnz). The Gutians were nomads from the mountains to the north. Gutian war parties held regular raids on the outer reaches of the kingdom. As a result, trade slowed and fields lay untended. Eventually, the Gutian nomads took over Akkad, and the Akkadian Empire collapsed. The Gutians had little understanding of how a civilized society worked. They let the canal network fall apart and brought on a terrible famine. Their 125-year rule of Sumer led to what came to be known as the Dark Age of Mesopotamia. It was not until the seventeenth century BCE under the reign of King Hammurabi that Mesopotamia would return as a thriving empire called Babylonia.",977.0
" However, it can have a steam explosion if the core (the area containing the uranium) gets too hot. This would spew out a lot of dangerous radiation. A second danger is the waste material nuclear power plants produce. Even when uranium is no longer useful for generating electricity, it is still highly radioactive. It remains dangerous for thousands of years.
In years to come, we will have to find substitutes for oil. Hydroelectric power may also be replaced, too. Many people are concerned about the environmental effects of dams and would like to see many dams torn down. The use of solar energy will probably continue to grow. Energy experts also say that more nuclear power plants will have to be built to meet growing energy needs.
Scientists are also researching other ways to generate energy, such as using wind turbines or geothermal energy. Wind turbines generate electricity when their blades turn in the wind. The turbines require no fuel and don’t create pollution, but they are huge and can kill local birds. Geothermal energy comes from deep underground where the Earth is very hot. Water can be circulated down into the ground in pipes to absorb that heat. The hot water can then be used to heat homes and buildings. However, in many areas, the underground heat can be difficult and expensive to reach.
Two things are certain. We need energy, and the fossil fuels that supply most of our energy will not last forever. Finding renewable alternatives is key to the world’s energy future. Scientists will continue to do research. Each new source of energy will have its pros and cons. Governments, businesses, and environmentalists will continue to debate which energy sources are best while our need for energy continues to grow.",965.0

If rains don’t increase soon, odds are good that desert residents will have to start rationing water. More than 30 million people depend on the Colorado River. It now trickles to an end before it can reach the sea.
Scientists say climate change is also responsible for the melting of glaciers high in the Himalayan Mountains. The glaciers help provide freshwater for 1.5 billion people living in India, Pakistan, and six other Asian countries. In the past, the melting glaciers slowly released water into the tributaries of the Indus, Ganges, and Brahmaputra Rivers. Now the rapid melting of the glaciers is depleting the water supply. At the same time, the increased glacial melt has caused severe flooding along each of the three As climate change worsens, less water is available for producing energy, raising livestock, and growing crops. Wildlife and natural ecosystems suffer. Arguments break out between cities, states, and even countries over who has the best claim to water.

However, on November 1 the girls were separated from their mother. The Nazis sent Margot and Anne to Bergen-Belsen, a different concentration camp in Germany.
Germany surrendered in May 1945, ending World War II in Europe. Allied soldiers who liberated the concentration camps were horrified by what they found. They saw many signs of the systematic murders that had been carried out there. Most of the survivors were sick, starving, and close to death.
Otto Frank survived. He returned to Amsterdam, already knowing his wife had starved to death at Auschwitz. However, he held out hope that Margot and Anne still lived. Soon, though, he received the heartbreaking news from a friend who had known the girls at Bergen-Belsen. They had become sick and died within a week of each other in February 1945, just weeks before British forces liberated the camp. Anne was just fifteen years old. Miep Gies gave Otto Frank the five notebooks, along with more than two hundred loose sheets of his daughter’s writings. He was immediately struck by Anne’s talent. Instead of a little girl’s stories, he found a moving memoir of her experiences. “I had no idea of the depth of her thoughts and feelings,” he later said.

This was to be a poignant retaliation upon the officer who had said “mule drivers,” and later “mud diggers,” for in all the wild graspings of his mind for a unit responsible for his sufferings and commotions he always seized upon the man who had dubbed him wrongly. And it was his idea, vaguely formulated, that his corpse would be for those eyes a great and salt reproach. The regiment bled extravagantly. Grunting bundles of blue began to drop. The orderly sergeant of the youth’s company was shot through the cheeks. Its supports being injured, his jaw hung afar down, yet in spite of this he made attempts to cry out. In his endeavor there was a dreadful earnestness, as if he conceived that one great shriek would make him well. The youth saw him presently go rearward. His strength seemed in nowise impaired. He ran swiftly, casting wild glances for succor. Others fell down about the feet of their companions. Some of the wounded crawled out and away, but many lay still, their bodies twisted into impossible shapes.
The youth looked once for his friend. He saw a vehement young man, powder-smeared and frowzled, whom he knew to be him. The lieutenant, also, was unscathed in his position at the rear. He had continued to curse, but it was now with the air of a man who was using his last box of oaths. For the fire of the regiment had begun to wane and drip.

" When people heard the score, many thought it was a joke and did not believe it. In another famous game, the United States defeated Colombia in 1994 when a Colombian player accidentally knocked the ball into his own goal.
Three of the biggest soccer legends are Pele (PAY-lay), Ronaldo, and Zinedine Zidane (zee-nuh-DEEN zih-DAHN). Most people consider Pele to be the greatest soccer player of all time. This Brazilian is the only man to have played on three winning World Cup teams. Pele scored twelve World Cup goals during his career.
The World Cup’s greatest goal scorer is another Brazilian, named Ronaldo. He scored fifteen goals during his World Cup career. He was the leading scorer in the 2002 World Cup with eight goals. That year, he helped Brazil win the title.
Zinedine Zidane, also known as “Zizou” (ZEE-zoo), helped France win the 1998 title. He scored two goals to help France beat Brazil 3-0. He also scored for France in the 2006 final. Many people think of him as one of the sport’s greatest players.
What’s Your Number?
There are eleven players on a soccer team, and you can often tell what a player’s job is by looking at his uniform number. The player who wears number 10 is often the player who scores and helps others to score. Pele and Zidane both wore number 10. Watch for that number whenever you’re at a game. The goalkeeper often wears number 1.
It’s easy to see why the World Cup is so successful. At each World Cup, fans from many nations visit the host country. They sing, chant, and cheer their teams at the stadium. Each host country adds new traditions and new memories to one of the world’s greatest sporting events.",732.0
" With a little practice, almost anyone can assemble a kite and learn to fly it. One day, you may want to test your new kite-handling skills with multiple-stringed stunt kites. Or you may want to participate in an extreme kite sport, such as kitesurfing —where a big power kite pulls your surfboard!
Step 1: Form a cross shape with the sticks. Wrap tape around the sticks where they meet.
Step 2: Cut off a 4-foot (120 cm) piece of string. Tape each end of the string to each end of the long stick. This string is called the bridle. Tie one end of the rest of string to the middle of the bridle.
Step 3: Lay the cross on the open plastic bag. Cut a diamond shape around it. Make sure to cut the diamond shape wider than the ends of the sticks.
Step 4: Fold the corners of the diamond over the ends of the sticks. Tape the corners tightly to the sticks.
Step 5: For a tail, tape the strip of cloth or plastic to the bottom of the kite.
When it’s time to test your first kite, pick a breezy day and take it to a flat, open area, even a beach, if one is nearby. Look around you to be sure that there are no power lines or big trees to tangle your kite. Make sure that there is nothing on the ground that you could trip over. Ready to start? Hold your kite up by the bridle and run into the wind. When you feel it tug, let go of the kite! Let out a little string, slowly, until you feel the wind pulling your kite. Keep letting out more string until your kite is flying high!",628.0
" TEDs have saved the lives of many turtles. However, some shrimp fishermen do not follow the law. Shrimp nets without TEDs continue to be a danger to sea turtles.
Sea turtles are also hunted for their shells, which are used to make combs, eyeglass frames, and souvenirs. Another danger to sea turtles is the illegal collection of their eggs for food. Green turtles and other sea turtles are also hunted illegally for their meat. All eight species of sea turtles are threatened or endangered in the United States. It is illegal to harm or interfere with a sea turtle or its eggs. An international treaty protects all species of sea turtles, and over 100 countries have banned the import or export of sea turtle products. Still, many people break laws or are careless. Sea turtle protection must be improved considerably if they are to survive into the future.
Many people in many countries are working to keep sea turtle numbers from dwindling. Volunteers in many nesting areas put screens over the nests to keep out predators, and post warning signs to alert beachcombers to the presence of nests. Eggs laid too close to the water are often moved to higher ground. People are also working to protect important nesting sites by making them wildlife refuges. Also, many clinics help to rescue and give medical attention to injured sea turtles.
Some zoos and aquariums have captive sea turtles. Sea turtles are much happier in the wild. But it is also good for people to learn about sea turtles and watch them up close. People can also learn about the many hazards to sea turtle survival caused by humans. Hopefully, enough people will care about sea turtles to preserve their habitats and help them to survive.",979.0
" It makes bus routes larger and more complex. One school bus route in rural Texas took some students roughly 100 miles (160 km) each way in the mid-1990s. These students spent more time on the bus than they did in school!
School buses are forty times safer than private cars. Bus drivers receive strict safety training. What’s more, school buses have emergency exits and reinforced roofs. They have seats that help keep students safe in the event of a crash. The seats are spaced closely together, and seat backs are made to absorb an impact. Buses may also include flashing stop signs, which alert drivers that students are getting off or on the bus. Some buses have cameras that help drivers see what’s happening inside the bus and outside.
Yellow Buses Go “Green”
Some school districts are also beginning to make changes to buses that help the environment. For instance, one school bus in New York has an electric engine that doesn’t pollute the air. The bus can travel for about 120 miles (190 km) before it needs to be recharged. Another “green” trend in school buses is the use of propane fuel. Propane is much less expensive than normal bus fuel and less polluting.
School buses can also cut down pollution by replacing private vehicles. The average school bus can drive fifty-four students, which keeps about thirty-six private vehicles off the road. This fact, along with newer, greener technology, can help keep the air cleaner.
The school bus slows to a stop. Sarah gathers her things and follows the other students off the bus. The bus pulls away from the curb, its job done for now. At the end of the day, it’ll be waiting for them, ready to start the whole journey again in reverse.",942.0
" Sloth bears live in the forests and grasslands of India and the neighboring island of Sri Lanka. Their favorite food is termites. A sloth bear has a long snout that it uses to suck out these insects from their nests. These bears also eat fruit, berries, and honey. When feeding, they make a loud sucking noise that can be heard from far away.
The sun bear is the smallest member of the bear family. Mostly black, it gets its name from the light-colored patch of fur on its chest that is shaped like a rising sun. Sun bears live in lowland tropical rainforests in Southeast Asia. They feed on both plants and animals. They have unusually long tongues to help them remove insects from hard-to-reach places. Sun bears are sometimes called honey bears because of their fondness for honey. Sun bears like honey so much that they will brave angry bees to get it—and eat the bees, too!
Stories about bears attacking people are frightening, but bears are in greater danger from people than people are from bears. Because of human activity, bear populations are shrinking. Over half of all bear habitats worldwide have been destroyed by humans for farming, mining, and forestry. Five kinds of bears are endangered, and the other three are decreasing in numbers. Another threat to bears is hunters, who kill bears for meat, sport, or the use of body parts for medicinal purposes. Other people hunt bears because they consider them to be pests that threaten crops or livestock. Conservationists and wildlife biologists are working to save bears from extinction. Many people are trying to protect bear habitats and stop hunting so that bears can continue to survive in the wild.",908.0
" Test matches are long, multiday matches that decide international championships.
Cricket was featured in the 1900 Olympic Games. Since then, cricket’s popularity around the world has grown. Now, international teams play against nations that ruled cricket during its Golden Age. They bring new things to the sport, like the fast bowling style created by West Indian players.
Today, the best teams in the world play cricket on a professional international level in Test matches, with ten national teams currently competing at this level. Outside the Test level, there are numerous levels of play. Women’s teams play at the national and international levels. There are also leagues and special matches that follow special rules.
Over the centuries, there have been many outstanding cricket players. W. G. Grace (1848–1915) changed the way the sport was played by creating a smart, complicated batting style that could handle a variety of bowling styles. He’s widely considered one of the most important cricket players ever. Kumar Shri Ranjitsinhji (koo-MAR SHREE rahn-JEET-seeng-jee), known as “Ranji” (1872–1933), was a royal leader in his home country of India. He was introduced to cricket in England and became one of the sport’s best batters. The Ranji Trophy, the Indian national championship, is named after him. Since 1889, each year five players are chosen as cricket’s Players of the Year. In 2009, Claire Taylor (1975–) became the first woman to win the honor.

I know it wasn’t the way you wanted it.” Morty turned to see his sisters’ ears perked up—they had been listening. “I am sorry to both of you, too,” he added quietly. Morty’s aunt seemed to glow as she broke into a big smile. “Well, it worked out just fine,” she said, hugging Morty again. “I am the only bride I know that had a flower boy along with two flower girls.” One of Morty’s little sisters spoke up, “It was kind of nice to have him up there. It was a long time to stand, and it helped to have Morty to hold onto.”
Father had joined the conversation and was the last to speak. Putting a paw on his son’s head, he said, “Morty, I have never seen you stand so still and be so quiet for so long.” Perhaps enduring that very uncomfortable situation was enough of a punishment.” Morty sighed with relief.
Then his father added, “I never, ever want you putting gel on the bottom of shoes ever again.” Morty nodded and realized that he would never experience the thrill of mock ice- skating with Ben and Fred on Mother’s shiny kitchen floor.

Cathy’s dream of going to the Olympic Games came true in 1996 in Atlanta, Georgia. She ran the 400-meter dash in her best time ever. It made her the sixth fastest woman in history, but she lost the gold medal to an even faster runner. She did win the silver, and with it, the respect and admiration of the Australian people.
The following year, she won a major international track title at a World Championship event in Athens, Greece. As she circled the stadium in the victory lap, she again carried both the Australian and Aboriginal flags, and no one objected. Soon after, she was named Australian of the Year. This took her another step toward being an important role model for Aborigines. In doing so, she was helping all Australians come together as one people.
The Olympic Games of the Year 2000 were held in Sydney, Australia. Cathy Freeman was a leading contender for a gold medal. She was honored by being chosen to light the Olympic torch. Then, in a stunning 400-meter run, Cathy won Australia’s 100th gold medal in a stadium in her own country. All Australians cheered wildly as they watched her carry both flags in her victory lap. Together they sang the national anthem and proudly spoke about “Our Cathy.” Cathy presented her bouquet of Australian flowers to her mother, Cecelia, whose teary face was filled with pride and joy.
Cathy Freeman is a real world champion, both on the running track and in life. She has become a role model for all Australians.

Humans have hunted puffins for hundreds of years for their meat, eggs, and feathers. In some places, these seabirds are still hunted. Humans also catch too many of the particular types of fish that puffins eat. The fish get caught far faster than they can reproduce. Warmer sea temperatures due to climate change are also resulting in fewer fish for puffins. Some types of fish that are now plentiful are too big for chicks to eat, and others are less nutritious. Puffins also get caught in fishing nets, and they are harmed by pollution. Humans have disturbed many of their nesting areas. Another serious threat is other predators, including gulls, eagles, rats, and foxes. In places where puffins live, people are working to solve the problems so these amazing seabirds can continue to live. They are unique members of Earth’s natural community. They are also important signs of the health of our oceans. When the oceans are healthy, puffins are healthy.
To see puffins in the wild, remember that they’re out at sea for many months each year. They’re only on land during the breeding season. They’ll mainly be found on cliffs and islands that are difficult to reach, but it’s worth the effort if you can get there. Choose a place that allows wildlife viewing. Be careful not to disturb nesting birds. People may hike many miles to see puffins and only catch a glimpse of one or two. You may have an easier time seeing them on a boat tour. You’ll probably be able to see them from a closer distance. Tour companies know the prime areas for puffins, and they’ll share interesting information about these birds. Wherever you travel to see puffins, take binoculars and a camera. These little clowns are sure to amuse and fascinate you.",906.0

Legend has it that they catch bad dreams, which get burned up by the Sun the next day. Good dreams pass through dreamcatchers and allow for peaceful sleep.
Wrap a wire or wooden hoop with yarn to use as the foundation of your dreamcatcher. Handle your creation gently as you work on it to avoid distorting the shape of the hoop.
Using yarn and the finger-weaving technique on page 10, create as many woven strips as you want. Attach them to your dreamcatcher with square knots.
Add other pieces of yarn as desired, using a combination of knotting and braiding. Use your imagination to create designs and different ways of attaching yarn. You can create symmetrical patterns, spider webs using half knots, freeform patterns, and more.
Attach beads, feathers, and other decorative items directly to the hoop or to fringe you tie to the hoop. Use a small drop of white glue if needed to hold things in place.

A terrified Chick-a-Dude sprung into the air as though lifted like a puppet by a string and landed—plonk!—in an empty stew pot on the stovetop.
Christine heard the commotion and raced to the kitchen. “I think we need to get you to a safer place,” she told Chick-a-Dude, “and give you your territory back,” she told Misty.
“You must be Christine and Chick-a-Dude,” guessed a woman named Kay as they entered the yard gate. “We spoke on the phone. I’m so glad you found us on the Internet.” “My mom drove me right over after we spoke.” “You did the right thing by bringing Chick-a-Dude to the Wildlife Rescue Center,” said Kay. “Hundreds of species of injured or orphaned wildlife—mammals, birds, and reptiles—come through these doors, and our staff is trained to provide the best possible care for all of them.” Kay went on to explain that a veterinarian would examine Chick-a-Dude. Then, because Chick-a-Dude already had his flight feathers, he’d stay in the flight cage where he’d practice flying with other rescued birds. He’d be fed every 30 minutes by hand—food and vitamins.

" An unusual spider with an interesting way of traveling also lives in the Sahara. When it feels danger, it flings itself end over end in a movement called flic-flac. The spider can travel forward or backward, and even uphill using this move, and at an impressive speed: 2 meters (6.6 ft.) per second, twice as fast as it usually travels. However, the flipping requires so much energy that the spider can only do it a couple times each day or it will die.
Morocco is famous around the world for its food, which includes Spanish, French, Berber, and Arab flavors. A tiny round pasta called couscous is popular in Moroccan foods. Vegetables such as tomatoes, onions, peppers, and eggplant are also common, along with many kinds of fruit. The flavors of garlic, olives, lemons, and spices are often present in Moroccan food. Kebobs are popular, as is a lamb stew that people serve for a Muslim holiday called Ramadan. People in Morocco also enjoy eating pigeon meat, especially when baked into a light, sugar-topped pastry called b’stillah (buh-STI-lah). In areas along the coast, people also eat fish often. To wash down their meals, people in Morocco often choose a sweet mint tea or black coffee.

" Foxes, skunks, bush dogs, and many bird species live on the South American pampas. Some larger animals in these regions live in protected areas. However, leopards and zebras survive in the wild in some parts of the South African veldt. Other veldt species include hyenas, badgers, weasels, crocodiles, and pythons.
Native peoples thrived in grasslands for thousands of years. These included Plains Native Americans, Australian Aboriginals, and the Hadza people in the Serengeti region. The arrival of European settlers had a significant impact on these peoples’ traditional lifestyles. Today, much of the land is used for farming and ranching. Grasslands—particularly temperate grasslands, with their rich soils—are ideal for growing crops and grazing livestock. An estimated 20 percent of the world’s grasslands are used to grow wheat and other cereal crops. Over 40 percent are used for grazing livestock. People could not live without grasslands because of the quantity of food they provide. These activities also provide livelihoods for large numbers of residents.
On first look, one might not think that grasslands are very interesting. The flat, grassy land has very little variety compared to some other biomes. However, grasslands are unique and fascinating for other reasons. Take a moment to think about grasses—humble plants that few people would consider extraordinary. They cover vast areas of land, moving gently like a living sea when the wind blows across them. They survive fires, droughts, intense summer heat, and below-freezing temperatures. Grasses provide food for an amazing variety of animals, from insects to bison. They also add nutrients to the soil, so much so that this biome has become the world’s main source of grain. The wonder of grasslands lies in the fact that such humble plants are so important to life’s balance on Earth.",1049.0

" Greenland sharks slowly cruise the Arctic Ocean. One of these giant sharks reached 392 years of age. These animals have adapted to extreme cold by having slower heart rates and metabolism—the chemical reactions within their bodies. Evidence suggests that slowing down these body processes also slows down aging.
A few creatures go beyond the ability to simply lead a long life. They can do truly special things. The African lungfish lives in shallow pools and breathes air at the surface. During a drought, it can postpone death by burrowing into moist mud. It turns around and places both its head and tail just inside the tunnel’s entrance. Then it builds a mucus cocoon around itself, leaving a small hole to breathe through. In this cocoon, the lungfish can survive for months and even years without drinking or eating. When the rains return, it breaks out of its sticky safety net to continue its life in a muddy pool of water. The immortal jellyfish is even more bizarre. If it faces a threat to its well-being, it can change from a mature adult jellyfish back into a group of polyps. The polyps pop off and eventually become individual adult jellyfish. While no single jellyfish of its kind lives forever, this species has found its own kind of immortality.
Scientists still have much to learn about aging and life spans. The animal kingdom holds many fascinating examples of different life spans that show how cells, body size, metabolism, adaptations, and the environment each play a role in an animal’s life span. Studying animal life spans can help us understand the many factors that contribute to aging and may one day allow us to live longer, healthier lives.",1071.0
" This wing construction is the secret—and the science—behind what makes an airplane fly.
The upper surface of an airplane’s wing is curved, and the bottom surface is flat. This means that air flowing across the upper surface has a greater distance to travel than the air moving across the lower surface. In order to keep pace with the air flowing under the wing, the air flowing over the top of the wing must move faster. The faster the air moves, the less pressure it exerts. The slow-moving air beneath the wing exerts greater pressure on the wing’s lower surface than the fast-moving air exerts on the wing’s upper surface. The greater pressure under the wing pushes the wing upward. This upward push of air, called lift, causes a plane to leave the ground and fly.
Because moving air causes these different air pressures, the airplane’s forward momentum is critical for it to fly. The forward motion makes the air flow over the airplane’s wings and creates the differences in pressure—it creates the lift needed for the plane to overcome gravity. As long as the aircraft’s wings keep moving forward fast enough to generate lift, the airplane will remain airborne.
As you imagine yourself sitting inside an airplane and gazing out the window, don’t think about how heavy the airplane is, loaded down with people and cargo. Instead, notice the shape of the wings and consider the air flowing over them. The Wright brothers did! And because of their speculation and experimentation with wing shape and engines, the airplanes of today are able to take us just about anyplace in the world. Where would you like to go?",1004.0
" The wigs were part of a uniform for doctors, lawyers, judges, and members of the church. These wigs were often made from horsehair, which was stiff and thick but was also cheaper than human hair. Even when the large, curled, powdered wigs fell out of fashion, these professionals continued to wear them in public. To this day, judges and lawyers in the United Kingdom court system wear wigs as part of their uniforms.
Toupees came into fashion during the eighteenth century, too. While still curled and powdered, they were much cooler and lighter to wear. Full wigs were extremely hot and also quite By the 1850s, many people in Europe had stopped wearing wigs. Common people often saw them as a luxury only the rich could afford. Some people collected old wigs and sold them in the streets for small sums of money. People bought them to use as floor mops and polishing rags.
Hair Today, Gone Tomorrow?
As technology improved in the twentieth century, people began to create wigs out of nylon threads. Nylon resembled human hair but cost much less. It also allowed for a larger choice of colors, which gave people an even greater variety of looks and locks. Today, people continue to wear wigs for many reasons. They wear them to appear fashionable and stylish or simply to change their appearance. People who are bald or losing their hair wear wigs to boost their self-esteem. Performers such as clowns or actors might wear wigs as part of their costumes.

" One was Granada, a part of Spain still under Muslim control. The other was the Empire of Mali in West Africa. In Granada, Ibn Battuta met with Muslim leaders. He also met a young writer named Ibn Juzayy. They would meet again when Ibn Battuta’s travels were finished.
Ibn Battuta was reluctant to make the long, difficult trip to Mali. However, the sultan of Morocco ordered him to. The sultan wanted to learn more about this fabled land, said to be wealthy beyond imagination. Ibn Battuta spent eight months in Mali as the guest of its ruler, Sultan Mansa Sulayman. He was impressed by the richness of the sultan’s court. Ibn Battuta returned to Morocco in 1354—this time for good. He was now fifty years old.
In Morocco, Ibn Battuta hired Ibn Juzayy to write his memoirs. Ibn Juzayy “improved” the traveler’s straightforward narrative with flowery wording and poetry. The resulting chronicle was called the Rihlah (Journey). The book provides a valuable glimpse into the Islamic realms and rulers of the 1300s. In his final years, Ibn Battuta is thought to have served as an Islamic judge, but little is known of his later life. He died in Morocco in either 1368 or 1369. Some historians have been critical of the Rihlah, saying that parts of it may have been made up. Others argue that the many minor inaccuracies are probably due more to Ibn Battuta’s faulty memory than an intention to deceive.
During his lifetime, Ibn Battuta journeyed 75,000 miles (120,000 km)—more than five times as far as Marco Polo. That’s like going completely around the world three times! He visited and lived in dozens of countries. He was not an explorer. He visited no unknown lands. Nevertheless, he remains one of the greatest travelers in history.",899.0
" She, in turn, handed me a trash bag. She said that my last task was to collect a bag of trash because rangers always leave a place better than they had found it. After a short time, picking up the candy and gum wrappers that tourists sadly leave behind, I returned to the Ranger’s station. She thanked me and then had me recite the Junior Ranger oath.

We were both sad to leave, even Nana, but to cheer me up Nana handed me a long list of national parks where I could earn more Junior Ranger patches.

I asked Nana to help, and she was more than happy to do so. I think she has finally gotten over the fear of the outdoors. John Muir would be proud of both of us.",1032.0
"m. on July 3, 1937, Amelia was never heard from again.
What Happened to Amelia?
This question still haunts people today. The Itasca immediately joined the U.S. Navy in searching for Amelia’s plane. The Navy thought she may have gone down in a storm to the northwest of Howland Island. The search continued for weeks and is to date the most extensive air and sea search in U.S. Naval history. No sign of the plane, Amelia, or Fred was found.
After a year of searching, Amelia’s husband, George Putnam, concluded that she had perished at sea. But is that the full story?
Many people have tried to explain what happened to Amelia. Theories including equipment problems, poor navigation or piloting skills, and imprisonment abound. Some think Amelia and Fred survived an emergency landing and were picked up by a Japanese ship. They were kept as prisoners on a Japanese island and later died of disease. Others think that Amelia and Fred landed the plane at a different island. There, she and Fred were able to live on native foods but eventually died of either disease or old age.
Many think these theories are just made up. No evidence has been found to support either of these ideas, and the most likely answer is that Amelia ditched the plane in the water. It would have quickly broken apart in the fierce waves, over 10 feet (3 m) high. Perhaps before Amelia and Fred could have inflated their life raft, they drowned.
Whatever her fate, there is no doubt that Amelia Earhart is one of the greatest Americans of the 20th century. She died doing what she loved most and showed everyone that women didn’t have to live with limits. She showed people that anyone could fly, and she was a legend who changed the world.",947.0
" Now, though, he began to lose his taste for battle.
Returning to the front in August, Richthofen traded his biplane and its two sets of wings for a new Fokker triplane. The slow but highly maneuverable fighter featured three sets of wings and quickly became the aircraft with which he is most often remembered.
Despite headaches from the incompletely healed wound and his growing distaste for the war, Richthofen continued to be a thorn in the side of the Allies. On April 20, 1918, he scored his eightieth victory. It would be his last.
The next day, while engaged in combat above Allied lines, Richthofen was struck by a single bullet that pierced his heart. He managed to land safely and was pulled from his plane by Australian soldiers. He died moments later.
Allied pilots gave Richthofen a funeral with full military honors at a French cemetery. A wreath placed on his coffin read, “To our gallant and worthy foe.” Richthofen’s body was transferred to Germany after the war.
No one is certain who fired the bullet that struck Richthofen. Canadians thought it was one of their own pilots, Captain Arthur Brown. However, many historians believe the fatal bullet came from an Australian gunner on the ground.
With eighty confirmed victories, Richthofen was the greatest ace of World War I. In later times, people would revere other commanding figures of the air war. The French remembered René Fonck, with seventy-five victories, and Canadians honored Billy Bishop, with seventy-two. Americans had a special place in their hearts for Eddie Rickenbacker, who shot down twenty-six enemy planes in just the final eight months of the war.
Even so, in discussions of World War I fighter pilots, the first name that comes to most people’s minds is Manfred von Richthofen—the legendary Red Baron.",1022.0
" These comics are not to everyone’s liking. Some comics can even become the subjects of “banned book” campaigns, where a library is asked to take a book off the shelves. Spider-Man and Batman comics, for example, have been challenged in some places because of adult themes. Readers, teachers, and librarians often discuss censorship on panels at comic cons.
One result of these talks has been the rise of the labels “graphic novel” and “graphic memoir” to describe comics that are meant for adults. Some comics are still aimed at children, but comics as a whole are no longer “kids only.” Some comics are fictional and some aren’t; some are educational and some are meant for entertainment. Some deal with adult themes, while others provide an escape into fantasy worlds. Since comics are diverse, should all comics be shelved together in libraries and schools? What role do comics have in our society? These questions are frequent topics at comic con panels.
Keeping up with the variety of comic books can be challenging, but overall, it’s an exciting time for comic cons. The huge range of the comics available today has resulted in bigger and wider audiences for comics and conventions. Fans of every age, color, and gender can find themselves represented in a comic somewhere. Heroes might look like Superman, a young girl from Botswana, or a reporter on the ground in Bosnia. There is no limit to what can happen in a comic book or who can be its heroes. In the end, this is what draws people to comic cons. The cons (and the stories that inspire them) create worlds where ordinary people can be transformed into heroes. Many people return to that experience over and over.",1028.0

In Boston, General Thomas Gage, the commander of the British troops, became alarmed when he heard reports of colonists’ weapons stored at Concord, about 20 miles west of Boston. He sent British soldiers to take control of the weapons on the night of April 18, 1775. Gage also planned to arrest the leaders of the rebellion, Samuel Adams and John Hancock, who were in Lexington, a town not far from Concord. A Patriot doctor, Samuel Prescott, found out about Gage’s plans and warned the militia that the British were coming. On the way to Concord, the British soldiers encountered a group of 70 militiamen, waiting for them on the village green in Lexington. The British soldiers tried to walk past the militiamen, but an unordered shot rang out. No one is sure which side fired the first shot, but that shot started the Revolutionary War. It would become known as “the shot heard 'round the world.” In the fighting that followed, eight militiamen died and ten were wounded. The British continued on to Concord.
The British destroyed some supplies in Concord, but the Americans had hidden most of their weapons. Patriot leaders Hancock and Adams escaped arrest. Militiamen arrived at Concord in large numbers. They attacked the exhausted British soldiers at Concord’s North Bridge, and continued the attack the next day as the British soldiers began to march back to Boston. The soldiers were retreating from the fight. The militiamen hid behind trees and stone walls to fire upon the lines of British soldiers. The professional British soldiers were humiliated by their defeat at the hands of a ragtag group of quickly trained colonists. At Lexington and Concord, 273 British soldiers and 93 militiamen died. The Revolutionary War had begun.",1048.0
" Glinda the Good stepped down from her ruby throne to give the little girl a good-bye kiss, and Dorothy thanked her for all the kindness she had shown to her friends and herself. Dorothy now took Toto up solemnly in her arms, and having said one last good-bye she clapped the heels of her shoes together three times, saying: “Take me home to Aunt Em!” Instantly she was whirling through the air, so swiftly that all she could see or feel was the wind whistling past her ears. The Silver Shoes took but three steps, and then she stopped so suddenly that she rolled over upon the grass several times before she knew where she was.
At length, however, she sat up and looked about her. “Good gracious!” she cried. For she was sitting on the broad Kansas prairie, and just before her was the new farmhouse Uncle Henry built after the cyclone had carried away the old one. Uncle Henry was milking the cows in the barnyard, and Toto had jumped out of her arms and was running toward the barn, barking furiously. Dorothy stood up and found she was in her stocking-feet. For the Silver Shoes had fallen off in her flight through the air, and were lost forever in the desert.
Aunt Em had just come out of the house to water the cabbages when she looked up and saw Dorothy running toward her. “My darling child!” she cried, folding the little girl in her arms and covering her face with kisses. “Where in the world did you come from?” “From the Land of Oz,” said Dorothy gravely. “And here is Toto, too.

" The baby was born safely, and the mother and her infant son joined Lewis and Clark’s Corps of Discovery. The winter of 1804 and 1805 was very harsh. Food ran low. By springtime, the Corps of Discovery was eager to be on the move again. The Native Americans told them of a large waterfall not far upstream. Lewis and Clark believed that this waterfall was a signal that they were approaching the Continental Divide, where the rivers begin flowing west, toward the Pacific Ocean. The Corps of Discovery was sure that the Northwest Passage was not far off. On April 7, 1805, the Corps of Discovery headed west once more with hope in their hearts.

" In the event of a refugee crisis, the UNHCR provides food, clean water, shelter, and health care. Its ultimate goal is to help refugees return home safely. When that is impossible, it seeks countries willing to take them in.
The United Nations has programs that touch almost every corner of the globe. However, the UN remains a controversial organization. Some critics complain that it costs too much to run. Others point to the Security Council’s failures to put a stop to war and violence. Another complaint is that the UN plays favorites, ignoring the best interests of some countries in favor of others.At the same time, the UN has done a lot of good in its more than seventy years. It provides food to over ninety million people worldwide who might otherwise starve. It vaccinates more than half the world’s children, helping stop outbreaks of disease around the world. It seeks human rights for all people. It allows leaders to talk through their differences rather than fight about them.
The news people hear about is usually bad news. However, there has been a lot of good news to share since the UN was founded. For the first time ever, less than 10 percent of the world is living in extreme poverty, according to the World Bank. A Human Security Report study shows that deaths from war have fallen steeply since World War II. WHO reports that people’s average life span has increased and that fewer children die before age five. Many factors contribute to these good changes, but the UN has been one of them. The world faces many challenges in the years ahead. How the United Nations will rise to meet these challenges remains a big question.",937.0

" In August, Allied forces freed France from Nazi control. On May 7, 1945, Germany finally surrendered. Speaking to a London crowd, Churchill said, “This is your victory! It is the victory of the cause of freedom in every land.” Sadly, President Roosevelt was not around to enjoy the moment. He had died of a stroke the month before. Four months later, Japan surrendered as well. World War II was finally over. Widespread rejoicing was tempered by reflection on the terrible costs of the conflict. More than 40 million people around the world had died.
The world was now at peace, but political events took an unexpected turn for Churchill in 1945. In July, war-weary Britons rejected Churchill’s Conservative Party and voted the Labor Party into power. No longer prime minister, Churchill fell into a depression. In 1947, Churchill was alarmed by another development when Britain granted India its independence. Churchill had insisted that Britain never give in to India’s desire to leave the British Empire, but that empire was now coming to an end.
In 1953, while serving one last time as prime minister, Churchill was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. He was forced to resign from the government in 1955 because of ill health, but he continued writing. In 1958, he completed one of his most important pieces of writing, A History of the English-Speaking Peoples. In 1963, Churchill became the first person ever to be named an honorary citizen of the United States by an act of Congress. It was one of his final honors. He died on January 24, 1965, at the age of ninety. Honoring Churchill, British Prime Minister Harold Wilson called him “the greatest man any of us have known.”",950.0
" As it turned out, only Lincoln was killed, though Seward received serious knife wounds. Union troops tracked Booth and another man to a farm in Virginia. Booth was shot to death. Others in his group were later tried for their crimes. Four men were found guilty and hanged. Lincoln’s body was sent by a funeral train back to his home state of Illinois. Although gone, Lincoln lived long enough to achieve his main goals: saving the Union and ending slavery.
The end of the Civil War also began the next chapter in the history of the United States. By December 6, 1865, the Thirteenth Amendment had been ratified by enough states to become law. Two more amendments—the Fourteenth and Fifteenth—giving former slaves civil rights and voting rights, were passed within the next five years. After the war, the U.S. government protected the freed slaves under a system called Reconstruction. After Reconstruction ended in 1877, the Southern states found ways to get around the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments. Black people sank back into a condition of domination by white people. In the 1960s, black people finally obtained the rights supposedly guaranteed to them by the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments. The enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 can be considered the final chapter of the Civil War.
Beyond freeing the slaves, the Civil War established the principle that the United States is an indivisible nation. States, whatever their feelings about their country, do not have the right to secede from the Union. In the years since the Civil War, the nation has seen other times of great strain. Americans continue to be divided today on many issues, in many ways. Yet we remain one nation—the United States of America.",1000.0

The United States would not be able to stay out of the war. British and French ships began seizing and searching U.S. ships in order to keep supplies from reaching their enemies. The British also seized the sailors on the captured ships and forced them to serve as British sailors. This made U.S. citizens subject to British tyranny once again. In 1812, President Madison told Britain to stop searching and seizing U.S. ships or there would be war. Not satisfied with the response, Madison declared war on June 18, 1812. The United States did not have the ships to fight the British navy. An invasion to conquer British-controlled Canada failed. For two and a half years, the United States remained at war with Britain. On December 24, 1814, the two countries signed a peace treaty to end the war.
The United States engaged in one more battle against the British after the official end of the war. On January 8, 1815, Americans decisively won the Battle of New Orleans under General Andrew Jackson (who was unaware a peace treaty had been signed). Almost three hundred British soldiers died. The U.S. death toll was less than twenty. The victory at the Battle of New Orleans made it clear that the United States, not Great Britain, truly controlled the western part of the country. It also made U.S. citizens feel as if they had won the war. In truth, neither side was victorious. Maybe the most important outcome was that the late victory made the new United States of America feel truly united as one nation.

" The two men were hailed as heroes. Benjamin Franklin observed the historic flight. Asked by another spectator what this balloon was good for, he reportedly answered, “What good is a newborn baby?” On December 1, just ten days after the Montgolfiers’ triumph, Jacques Charles and Nicolas-Louis Robert made the first human ascent in a hydrogen balloon. Taking off from the Tuileries (TWEE-luh-reez) Garden in Paris, they flew for more than two hours, coming down in a town about 36 kilometers (22 mi.) away. In the following years, the Montgolfiers launched several more balloons. The brothers were honored by the French Academy of Sciences, and their father, Pierre, was made a nobleman by King Louis.
The passion for ballooning soon spread throughout Europe. It was not long, however, before the risks involved became clear. In June 1785, de Rozier and his copilot, Pierre Romain, were killed while attempting to fly across the English Channel in a balloon. Despite the risks, pioneers continued to develop balloon designs long after the balloon craze of the late 1700s had ended. In the 1800s, lighter-than-air vehicles were equipped with rudders and motorized propellers. By the 1930s, huge airships were flying passengers back and forth across the Atlantic Ocean. The golden age of airships ended abruptly in 1937, though, when the German airship Hindenburg caught fire and crashed while landing in New Jersey.  Today, airships are mostly used for advertising and can often be seen flying above open-air stadiums during large sporting events. Gas balloons are mostly used for gathering weather data, while hot-air balloons are mostly used for recreation. Many areas hold festivals each year in which hundreds of colorful hot-air balloons fill the sky. These events can make it appear as though balloon mania never ended.",1105.0
" The Nazis sent Margot and Anne to Bergen-Belsen, a different concentration camp in Germany.
End Germany surrendered in May 1945, ending World War II in Europe. Allied soldiers who liberated the concentration camps were horrified by what they found.
They saw many signs of the systematic murders that had been carried out there. Most of the survivors were sick, starving, and close to death. Otto Frank survived. He returned to Amsterdam already knowing his wife had died of starvation at Auschwitz, but he held out hope that Margot and Anne still lived. Soon, though, he received the heartbreaking news from an acquaintance who had known the girls at Bergen-Belsen. They had become sick with typhus and died within a week of each other in February 1945, just weeks before British forces liberated the camp. Anne was just fifteen years old. Miep Gies gave Otto Frank the five notebooks, along with more than two hundred loose sheets of his daughter’s writings. Otto took the books and began to read them. Instead of a little girl’s musings, he found a moving memoir of her experiences. “I had no idea of the depth of her thoughts and feelings,” he later said.
Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl first appeared in print in the Netherlands two years after the war and eventually became an international phenomenon. It is still read and taught worldwide, a tribute to a young girl’s spirit as well as a moving account of life in a time of terror and war.

" Hal drew his long hunting-knife. Mercedes screamed, cried, laughed, and manifested the chaotic abandonment of hysteria. Thornton rapped Hal’s knuckles with the axe-handle, knocking the knife to the ground. He rapped his knuckles again as he tried to pick it up. Then he stooped, picked it up himself, and with two strokes cut Buck’s traces. Hal had no fight left in him. Besides, his hands were full with his sister, or his arms, rather; while Buck was too near dead to be of further use in hauling the sled. A few minutes later they pulled out from the bank and down the river. Buck heard them go and raised his head to see, Pike was leading, Sol-leks was at the wheel, and between were Joe and Teek. They were limping and staggering. Mercedes was riding the loaded sled. Hal guided at the gee-pole, and Charles stumbled along in the rear.
As Buck watched them, Thornton knelt beside him and with rough, kindly hands searched for broken bones. By the time his search had disclosed nothing more than many bruises and a state of terrible starvation, the sled was a quarter of a mile away. Dog and man watched it crawling along over the ice. Suddenly, they saw its back end drop down, as into a rut, and the gee-pole, with Hal clinging to it, jerk into the air. Mercedes’s scream came to their ears. They saw Charles turn and make one step to run back, and then a whole section of ice give way and dogs and humans disappear. A yawning hole was all that was to be seen.

" The National Weather Service (NWS) has a system to try to help people stay safe during tornadoes. The NWS issues a tornado watch when it’s very possible that a tornado will strike soon. During a tornado watch, people should prepare in case a tornado does actually form. The NWS issues a tornado warning when a tornado has actually been spotted. At this point, it’s time to take action and get to a safe place.
In the event of a tornado warning, go indoors, into a basement if possible. You can also go into a closet or bathroom. Try to stay away from windows because a tornado can easily blast through the glass. Flying debris becomes very dangerous during a tornado, so it is a good idea to have protection against it. Crouch down low to the ground, beneath a heavy table or desk if possible.
Otherwise, cover yourself with a mattress or blankets. You can even crouch down in a bathtub. Always place your hands over your head. If you are in a tall building, go into a stairwell. Do not stay inside a mobile home. If you’re in a car and can’t escape the tornado, park the car, leave your seatbelt on, and lean forward. If you’re stuck outdoors and can’t find shelter, lie down flat on the ground, far away from trees.
Tornadoes are amazing—and scary—examples of the power of nature. Much more work needs to be done before we can fully understand these awesome weather events. Weather scientists are working to invent better ways to tell when a tornado is coming. Many questions remain, however. What are the exact conditions within a supercell that cause a tornado to form? What is the inside of a tornado really like? Perhaps one day we’ll find out.",863.0

Deserts Next to Oceans?
One thing that may seem strange is that both the Namib and the Atacama deserts lie next to oceans. Normally, the waters of the oceans would provide the moisture to create rainfall in the lands next to them. However, in both of these regions, cold currents in the oceans prevent the coastal waters from evaporating and forming rain clouds.

Storm chasers have to be able to interpret radar reports to find tornadoes to study. They look at weather data as storms form to locate a storm that might produce a tornado. Making an educated guess and relying on other storm chasers with more experience can place them five miles away from a tornado when it hits instead of 50 miles away. Being close means they’ll be able to collect the data they need to make better predictions.
A storm chaser’s job can seem like a “hurry up and wait” game. Professional storm chasers spend about 10 days “hunting” storms for every minute they spend actually watching, collecting data, or filming a tornado. Warren Faidley is a well-known storm chaser, photographer, and filmmaker. He says he sometimes has gone an entire year without seeing a tornado. When he does spot one, he wants to get the best possible pictures. But he also needs to stay a safe distance away. Winds that top 322 to 483 kph (200–300 mph) can toss cars around like toys. The trick for a storm chaser is to know when to get out of the area and how to predict a tornado’s path.
Storm chasers take their jobs seriously and believe they have an important mission. They now know that winds close to the earth may have a bigger role in forming a tornado than they previously thought. They know that the smaller the eye, or center, of the tornado, the faster it spins. But there is still so much to learn, and storm chasers work hard to collect more data to help all of us know more about the whirling storms that can destroy lives and rip apart entire towns in just a few minutes.",1166.0

Sareks National Park, Sweden— Sweden was the first country in Europe to create national parks. This one, far north above the Arctic Circle, is Western Europe’s largest area of wilderness. It is filled with majestic mountains and glaciers. It is also home to the Saami, or Lapp people, who herd reindeer.
(tah-SEE-LEE n-AH-jer)—Algeria, in Northern Africa, is situated in the fierce Sahara Desert. The landscape wasn’t always desert, however, and past civilizations left behind more than 15,000 drawings and engravings in caves and on the sides of cliffs. The art documents the history of humans since 6000 BC!
Often, it is difficult for countries to set aside useful land to establish national parks. Even after a national park is established, many threats can face preserved lands. In poor countries, people often use parklands for growing crops, grazing livestock, and gathering firewood to feed hungry people. If there is war or political troubles, people fleeing the violence often damage fragile environments. Some preserved lands hold gold mines of sorts— oil fields, mineral resources, or forests for logging. Many people believe that these resources should be used to create economic growth, and governments occasionally agree.
Even in a well-protected national park, too many visitors can cause plenty of problems, from leaving behind litter to trampling trails to polluting the air with snowmobile exhaust. It also can be difficult to experience the wilderness while surrounded by people. For all of the above reasons, national parks can become spoiled. Yet this reinforces their importance. Most areas of the world already have been changed by human industry and development. National parks are some of the last areas that have not been affected by human development. If future generations are to find their own special natural places, then people around the world must work to preserve these national treasures.",1065.0

The people who don’t believe a monster lives in the loch say: If there is only one large monster, the one St. Columba saw over 1,400 years ago would have died by now.

" However, there are many new tools to help people deal with color blindness. Smartphone apps can perform tasks such as identifying colors and picking colors that go together well. These apps can help people choose matching clothes or tell which fruits are ripe at the grocery store. Researchers have also created high-tech lenses that filter out specific wavelengths of light. Special sunglasses that use these lenses allow people with red-green color blindness to tell the two colors apart and see a full range of colors.
Recently, scientists were able to correct red-green color blindness in squirrel monkeys. The monkeys lacked red cone cells and, as a result, couldn’t tell the difference between red and green. Researchers used a virus to insert the red gene into the monkeys’ retinas. Within about twenty weeks, treated monkeys could tell the difference between red and green dots. This was exciting news because the monkeys had been color-blind since birth. Many doctors and scientists thought that color-blind monkeys’ brains would not have grown in a way that would allow them to see a full range of colors. These parts of the brain usually develop when the animals are young. Now that we know that color blindness can be cured in adult squirrel monkeys, there’s hope for a cure in adult humans, too.
Color Vision for All?
Every year, researchers gain a better understanding of color blindness and its causes. New tools help color-blind people choose ripe fruit and pick out matching clothes. People with red-green color blindness can use special glasses to allow them to tell the difference between shades of red and green. Best of all, a treatment for color blindness may be available in the near future. Who knows? Maybe someday soon, color blindness will become a thing of the past!",1108.0
" Wood found at the site from the far north led some Europeans to think that another civilization, such as people living along the Mediterranean Sea, had constructed it. For decades they tried to prove that idea. They ignored items found at the site that suggested local people had built the city. They even damaged or destroyed parts of the site while they searched for signs of a foreign culture. Finally, in 1905, an archaeologist examined the artifacts found at the site and was able to prove that local Africans built Great Zimbabwe.
A few different tribes claim to be the descendants of the people of ancient Great Zimbabwe. However, most people today believe that the Shona people built the ancient city. The Shona have been living in that area for many centuries. Some of the artifacts, such as tools found in the ruins by archaeologists, are very similar to items that the Shona people were using during the nineteenth century. In addition, many people think that the word Zimbabwe comes from a Shona phrase that means “stone houses.”
The United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) designated the ruins of Great Zimbabwe a World Heritage Site in 1986. This means nearly all the countries in the world recognize the site as worthy of admiration and protection. However, the site has been damaged over time. People from around the world visit the site, adding to the need for repair. Plants threaten to grow over many of the remaining structures. Weather has also taken a toll on the site. More funding and staff are needed to study and preserve the ruins. Great Zimbabwe’s oldest walls have stood for roughly one thousand years. With proper care, they may stand for a thousand more.",979.0
" Never failing to speak her mind, she was also respected for her intelligence and honesty.
In 1965, at age forty-one, Tallchief grew tired of performing and all the travel her career required. Nine years earlier, she had married Henry Paschen, who was from Chicago, Illinois, and they had a daughter together. Tallchief retired from dancing and moved to Chicago to devote time to her family. In 1975, Tallchief became the creative director of the Chicago Lyric Opera Ballet. She founded the Chicago City Ballet in 1980 because she felt that Chicago deserved an important ballet company. She served as its creative director until 1987. Many students whose lives she touched went on to have successful ballet careers.
During her retirement, Tallchief also worked to preserve the work of Balanchine, who died in 1983. She felt strongly that his ballets should be danced the way he originally intended. She and several other Balanchine ballerinas recorded sections of his ballets so future students could learn from them. In 1996, she was inducted into the National Women’s Hall of Fame, which honors extraordinary women’s achievements. The same year, she was given a Kennedy Center award. This award recognizes artists who have made outstanding contributions to American culture. She died at age eighty-eight on April 11, 2013, in Chicago. The world paid tribute to her life and work.
Maria Tallchief was an American trailblazer. As the first prima ballerina from the United States, she helped inspire a new style of ballet. As professional ballet’s first Native American star, she opened its doors to ethnic minorities. Her grace, talent, and achievement helped move the world of ballet forward. A fellow dancer, Jacques d’Amboise (ZHAHK dahm-BWAHZ), once said of Tallchief, “There is one word for her: grand. She was absolutely grand.”",987.0
" Tesla filed a lawsuit but was so strapped for cash after spending his fortune on many failed projects that he could not pursue the case. It wasn’t until 1943 that the U.S. Supreme Court finally credited Tesla with the invention, calling him the “father of radio.”
Still, Tesla worked to develop wireless technology. In 1901, he began building a tower on Long Island that he hoped would be powerful enough to send out electronic telephone calls, pictures, stock market reports, and weather information. “When wireless is fully applied the Earth will be converted into a huge brain, capable of response in every one of its parts,” he said. Tesla ran out of money before the tower was finished. He lost ownership of the property, and the tower was demolished.
In 1943, Tesla died at age eighty-six while living in a hotel room that had been paid for by Westinghouse. Although Tesla spent his riches on failed project after failed project, and while he never received the credit he deserved for his research and inventions, the inventor had a huge effect on technology and the shape of the modern world. His innovations with alternating current powered modern cities and transformed life in rural areas that had been without electricity. His experiments with robots, radio, radar, and X-rays pointed the way to the future. Tesla’s dream of a wireless world eventually came true. His fingerprints are all over things that we today take for granted, such as the Internet and wireless communication. Tesla’s love of creating things made him a giant among modern-day scientists. He once said, “I do not think there is any thrill that can go through the human heart like that felt by the inventor as he sees some creation of the brain unfolding to success.”",1187.0
" Others paint their dugouts, usually white to make them brighter and lighter. There is very little dust inside. Dugouts are soundproof, blocking out traffic and neighbor noise. I think I’m pretty lucky to be living in such a unique home, so full of character.”
Lying below the Worlds of Fun and Oceans of Fun theme parks in Kansas City, Missouri, is a different kind of world known as SubTropolis. SubTropolis calls itself “the world’s largest underground business complex.” Originally a limestone mine, the enormous underground space is now rented out to a variety of businesses for storage, manufacturing, printing, and other purposes. The complex is completely protected from the outdoors, so its tenants never have to worry about rain, snow, ice, wind, or other rough weather conditions. Even though the employees don’t look up and see the sky in SubTropolis, the interior is painted white, which makes it seem light and bright.
Underground temperatures and humidity are constant. As a result, businesses use roughly one-quarter of the electricity that they would aboveground, and there’s no problem with moisture build-up. Because of this minimal use of electricity, one tenant calls SubTropolis truly environmentally friendly. Also, due to the constant climate underground, many treasures are safely stored in SubTropolis. These include millions of U.S. Postal Service collectable stamps and old, original film reels from classic movies and TV shows.
Although many underground shopping areas exist around the world, no new large underground cities are being built today. However, individuals in many countries are building subterranean homes. Underground dwellers say that their homes use less energy, cost less to maintain, and offer more privacy than aboveground homes. Because of skyscrapers, today’s cities seem to be growing up toward the sky. In the future, they may instead grow down.",1096.0
" Ethanol is also made from potatoes and sugar cane. But it can also be made from ground-up wood and other plant and animal materials. So, if we want to produce more ethanol, we just have to plant more crops like corn and sugar cane. In a matter of months, the crop has grown, can be harvested, and then used to make ethanol.
To make ethanol from biomass means changing the plant matter into sugar. The sugar is then changed to alcohol in a process called fermentation. The diagram below shows the steps of one way of making ethanol from corn.
Pure ethanol can be burned in vehicles with special engines designed to burn it, or it can be mixed with gasoline and then burned in a regular engine. When ethanol is mixed with gasoline, it reduces the consumption of fossil fuels and reduces pollution.
What’s in the Future?
One thing you will have concluded by now is that the supply of oil to make gasoline won’t last forever. We can look at ways to make the current oil supply last longer by conserving gasoline. This can be done by driving cars with greater fuel efficiency, car-pooling, or simply driving less. Whatever we do to conserve, we still have to plan for the day when there will be no oil for making gasoline. Scientists are hard at work seeking alternative means for powering our cars and trucks. Will the popular choice be ethanol, hydrogen, solar energy, or chemical batteries? The alternative that wins out likely will depend on economic factors. Two important economic factors will be the cost to produce the alternative power supply and the eventual cost of the alternative fuel to the driver. What do you think you will be using to power your car when you are 70 years old?",1015.0

Sometimes we find the bones of exotic animals in an archaeological site. Exotic animals are those that come from a different place. An elephant is an exotic animal in North America, but normal in parts of Africa. Exotic animals are evidence of trade. For an elephant to come to a zoo in North America, it needs to be traded from a faraway place. Archaeological sites in the Southwest, such as Arizona, sometimes have bones from parrots. Parrots are exotic animals because they ordinarily only live in Central or South America. Archaeologists think these birds were valued for their colorful feathers. The remains of birds, such as parrots, being found thousands of miles north of where they usually live is evidence of long-distance trade.
In prehistoric North America, some people traveled thousands of miles to trade. Many times, traders used boats to travel along rivers or on the coast. For example, the Mississippi River was an important trade route that connected much of North America. Other times, people had to walk. Crossing mountain ranges, such as the Rocky or Appalachian Mountains, could take weeks of difficult walking. Today, it is easier to transport heavy trade goods long distances. Ships, trucks, trains, and planes are all used to carry trade goods among the countries of the world.
Trade doesn’t require a truck full of valuable objects such as televisions. Trade can occur when one person gives another person something in exchange for something else. Remember how William got his Japanese trading cards? Next time you take a trip, think about all the things you take with you. Afterward, think about the things you left behind. Did you exchange gifts with someone? Did you buy something you couldn’t get at home? That’s just what the prehistoric people of the world did.",933.0
" So many people worked under harsh conditions to build the Great Wall that a myth arose about the mortar containing the ground-up bones of dead workers. However, historians recently discovered the secret ingredient: sticky rice.
Visitors who are fortunate enough to tour the Great Wall will need to decide which sections to see. Badaling is the most commonly visited because it’s close to Beijing and is the safest section to walk. It also offers the Great Wall Museum, with nine exhibition halls on topics related to history, construction, art, and culture. However, Badaling can be crowded, and it’s full of souvenir shops. Most of the other sections have fewer tourists but are also much steeper, so be prepared for a challenging climb. Besides walking, climbing, and taking pictures, visitors can take a guided tour to learn about the wall’s history and construction. Cable car rides are available at some sections, and Mutianyu offers a toboggan ride.
The Great Wall of China is a remarkable landmark that continues to inspire and fascinate people around the world. The 2008 Summer Olympic Games, in Beijing, featured the wall since the Games always honor the history and culture of the host country. A representation of the wall was a highlight of the Opening Ceremony, and one of the cycling courses included loops between Badaling and Juyong (JOO-yoong) Passes. Swiss cyclist Fabian Cancellara, who won gold and silver medals, later said that he drew inspiration and strength from the effort it took to build the wall. The Great Wall has witnessed an enormous span of human history, from early farmers, warring states, and powerful empires to modern-day China. Many people are working to preserve the wall so it can continue to tell a part of Earth’s story for generations to come.",1179.0
" During this festival, they put new plaster on the mosque’s outside walls, which have cracked because of the changing weather. In the days before the festival, citizens collect fine clay soil from the Niger and Bani Rivers that they use to form a mud plaster. The women of Djenné normally supply water for the mixture, while young boys take up the task of mixing the plaster in special pits.
At the start of the festival, a race is held to see who will be the first to deliver plaster from the pits to the mosque walls. Then the work can begin. The men climb ladders using the mosque’s toron as ready-made scaffolding, and they apply the mixture to the cracking walls.Along with work, the lively festival includes music and food. Musicians entertain the workers to keep their spirits up and make the labor go more quickly. The town’s elders sit in a place of honor and watch the work progress, offering advice when needed. Young children sing, run, and play during the festival.
Today, many ancient mosques have been updated with modern features, such as electrical wiring and indoor plumbing. Although the Great Mosque of Djenné has been equipped with a loudspeaker system, locals have opposed additional updates in favor of preserving the building, which is an important part of their culture and religion. When Djenné was made a World Heritage Site by the United Nations in 1988, it gained protections to help preserve the city’s history. The Great Mosque, as well as other buildings in the historical zone, may not be updated with modern materials or technology. For the time being, Djenné’s people will continue to hold onto their cultural heritage and their annual festival.",1143.0
"” It was a tough fight that Ali described as “the closest I’ve come to death.” Frazier said, “I hit him with punches that would have knocked a building down.” In the fourteenth round, Ali threw everything he had at Frazier. He used the last of his strength to hit him with a storm of punches. Frazier threw in the towel. Both men were so beaten up that Ali later said, “We went to Manila as champions, and we came back as old men.”
Ali kept his title for another two and a half years before he lost it to Leon Spinks, but he fought Spinks again a few months later and won, becoming the only boxer to win the heavyweight crown three times. Ali didn’t fight again for two years, and when he did, he lost the title for good to Larry Holmes. At thirty-eight, his long career in the ring came to an end.
After retiring from boxing, Ali traveled the world speaking up for human rights. In 1984, he was diagnosed with Parkinson’s. This disease makes it hard for the brain to control the muscles. As his health declined, it became difficult for Ali to speak. But in 1996, he returned to the Olympic Games to light the Olympic flame in Atlanta. Ali clearly struggled to lift the torch, but as the crowd cheered he held the flame aloft, a fighter to the end.
In 2016, Muhammad Ali died at age seventy-four. The once controversial champ had become universally beloved. President Obama praised his courage, saying “Ali stood his ground.

Many of the biggest statues on Route 66 are food statues. Humongous oranges, donuts, cheeseburgers, and ice cream cones make for a mouthwatering ride. Look out the window near Collinsville, Illinois, and you may even catch a glimpse of the largest catsup bottle in the world!
Dinosaurs may be extinct everywhere else on Planet Earth, but not on Route 66—where you can be greeted by towering prehistoric creatures of all shapes and sizes.
At 150 feet (45.7 m) long, Dinny is likely the largest concrete dinosaur in America. He lives at a dinosaur park in Cabazon, California. Claude Bell built the park to lure visitors to his nearby restaurant, the Wheel Inn. The dinosaur park became famous and was even featured in the 1985 movie Pee-wee’s Big Adventure.
Saving Route 66
With Route 66’s popularity came traffic—lots of it. Heavy traffic congestion caused the highway to deteriorate. From 1956 through the 1980s, the United States government began building new interstates—high-speed highways with many lanes—around Route 66. As more and more travelers chose to take interstates, businesses on Route 66 suffered. Peeling paint, faded signs, and boarded-up windows became common sights.
In 1999, the United States Congress passed a law to protect Route 66. The government started offering money to help businesses and towns pay the cost of preserving important landmarks. In 2008, the World Monuments Fund declared Route 66 “endangered” and put together plans to help attract tourists, such as a virtual reality map.
Now Route 66 is resurging in popularity as many return to seek its amusing artwork and creative spirit. The best way to catch the spirit of Route 66 is to drive it— and have your own classic American experience!",1092.0
" The CAFE program has saved billions of barrels of fuel since it began in 1975, yet the most efficient cars still come from other countries, such as Japan and Germany. Some cars, like the Toyota Prius, get 50 miles per gallon, far better than the CAFE average (27.3 mpg, starting in 2011). Because the Prius is so efficient, it is also the least polluting. Volkswagen is working on a car that will get 235 miles per gallon!
Still, neither ANWR’s oil nor better fuel efficiency will make oil last forever. Sooner or later, the United States—and the world—will run out.
Luckily for us, life without oil doesn’t mean life without energy. Americans have ways to become energy independent—and not just for a year or two. The change to other forms of energy has already begun. Some of those forms of energy— like those that come from the wind and Sun—can last as long as people do. By choosing them, the United States can become energy independent and create more jobs than drilling in ANWR can. It can also help the planet.
In fact, there is cause for hope. In the 1970s, much U.S. electricity came from oil; today only 2 percent of its electricity is made that way. Most American cars still run on oil, but that can change. Some day you may drive an electric car powered by the Sun!
What do you think? Should drilling be allowed in ANWR? You can help decide its future. You can write the president or your representatives in Congress and tell them what you want. You can also help decide how the United States will get its energy in years to come. Remember: ANWR and the future both belong to you.",912.0
" Later, French explorers also claimed lands. More French and more English explorers came to claim land. As they explored, they found two resources that helped make money back in Europe: codfish and fur. This caused French and English traders to come, and colonies developed. During the 1400s to 1700s, France and England were often at war, and the conflicts spread to their colonies. With each peace treaty, Canadian lands were ceded to the winner, and eventually Great Britain won out. The colonies grew, but so did their desire for more independence. There were rebellions, but they failed until finally, in 1867, Britain allowed the colonies to become a dominion, with its democratic government’s capital in Ottawa. In 1931, Canada became fully independent when it became part of the British Commonwealth of Nations.
Canada Day, the nation’s birthday, is on July 1. People celebrate with parades, barbecues, and fireworks. The largest celebration is held in Ottawa. The Calgary Stampede celebrates Canada’s old west with bull riding, barrel racing, steer wrestling, bronc riding—even chuck wagon racing. Called “The greatest outdoor show on Earth,” it attracts about a million visitors. Canadians have winter festivals, too, with dogsled races, skiing, and ice-skating. The Quebec Winter Carnival is the largest such festival in the world. There you can enjoy the snow-sculpture contest, visit an ice castle, and even stay in a hotel made of ice and snow that is built every winter and melts away every summer.

" The German counterattack, although a failure, prevented British troops from linking up with Canadian troops from Juno Beach that day as planned. While the British were unable to reach the town of Caen the same day, the mission was still considered a huge victory for the Allies. Allied forces managed to stabilize the beach, advance roughly 4 miles (6.4 km) inland, and repel the German counterattack before meeting up with the Canadians the following day. Allied troops would eventually capture the town of Caen six weeks later, on July 20, 1944.
Although the cost in Allied and Axis soldiers’ lives was high, Operation Overlord was a tremendous success. Through great sacrifice, Allied forces succeeded in gaining a foothold from which to begin to push back German forces and liberate occupied France. While this operation was a tremendous military victory for the Allies, it was also a day of mourning. Because of the large amount of activity on D-Day, it was difficult to record accurate casualty numbers on either the Allied or the Axis side. The term casualties does not exclusively mean deaths, but rather all losses suffered by the armed forces: killed, wounded, missing in action, and prisoners of war. Historians estimate that the Germans had between four thousand and nine thousand casualties, and the Allies had more than six thousand casualties on D-Day. The war dragged on for roughly another year as Allied troops continued to capture German-occupied territories in Europe. Germany finally surrendered on May 8, 1945, and Japan surrendered on August 15, 1945, to officially end the war. D-Day and the eventual liberation of France proved to be significant turning points in World War II. Without the efforts and sacrifices of Allied soldiers on D-Day, the war would have had a much different outcome.",1302.0

Modern anime, like manga, has become more specialized, with characters and story lines geared toward specific audiences. Shonen—manga made for boys—stars male characters and has story lines that highlight action and comedy. The popular shonen Dragon Ball Z first ran in Japan in 1989 and continues to be shown on television stations throughout the world. Shojo—manga made for girls, at first starred female characters with story lines that focused on emotions and relationships. It eventually evolved to include more active heroines involved in romance and adventure. The 1990s anime series Sailor Moon by artist Naoko Takeuchi is a classic example of shojo. It tells the story of a middle-school girl who receives special powers and becomes a guardian of Earth, protecting it from evil forces.
In the 1980s and 1990s, Japanese studios began to make anime films that were hits around the world. In 1984, Hayao Miyazaki released Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind, which saw great success. It told the story of a young princess who must save her planet. In 2001, the Japanese anime Spirited Away brought the tale of a young girl who enters the spirit world to the big screen. The director, Hayao Miyazaki, received much praise for the film, which eventually won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature. Anime is featured in the latest twenty-first-century media, too. Favorite characters such as Astro Boy, Digimon, and Dragon Ball Z fighters spring to life in video games. Gamers control their heroes and heroines, directing them to fulfill missions at the push of a button. Just like figures from long ago, the images on the screen enact tales of adventure and daring.

" Avalanches buried entire groups of men alive—some were not found until spring. The Central Pacific Railroad did not keep track of how many Chinese laborers were killed while building the Transcontinental Railroad. It was probably hundreds. Finally, in 1867, the track broke through the mountains, and the Central Pacific moved onto the deserts of Utah.
Where Will They Meet?
The Union Pacific had a much easier time crossing the Rocky Mountains than the Central Pacific had crossing the Sierra Nevada. They took a gentle route called the South Pass, and they also moved quickly onto the deserts of Utah. On May 10, 1869, workers, railroad owners, journalists, and politicians gathered at Promontory Point, Utah, for the completion of the Transcontinental Railroad. The race was over—the Union Pacific had laid 1,086 miles (1,748 km) of track, and the Central Pacific had laid 689 miles (1,109 km), though the Central Pacific got extra money for building through the Sierra Nevada mountains. To celebrate the completion of the first railroad to cross the United States, the heads of the two companies would drive the last four spikes into the track. Special spikes were made of gold and silver. Leland Stanford, the head of the Central Pacific, and Thomas Durant, head of the Union Pacific, both raised sledgehammers, carefully aimed—and missed! But the Transcontinental Railroad was complete.
Suddenly, California was a few days of travel away from New York. Railroads soon stretched to Salt Lake City, Oregon Territory, and the Southwest. Towns sprang up along the track now that trains could bring passengers, supplies, and mail quickly and safely. The end of the Civil War had reunited the country from north to south. And for the first time, a transcontinental railroad united the country from east to west.",1105.0
" Believing that military action should only be used when necessary, Washington did not want the United States to get pulled into the conflict. He was committed to the idea that the United States would remain neutral. It was not a well-liked decision. For the first time in his career, Washington faced unpopularity with both the public and the press.
Setting a precedent that would remain in place for nearly 150 years, Washington decided to end his presidency after two terms. Before he was finished, however, he offered some advice to the young nation he loved so much. In his Farewell Address, Washington, ever conscious of military matters, urged caution when making alliances with other nations since he believed such friendships could lead to war. He also warned against forming too large an army, which might also encourage military conflicts. Most important, Washington felt, was for the American people to stand united as one nation. Relieved to return to Mount Vernon and be a farmer again, a tired Washington began his retirement in 1797. In late 1799, he became ill with a bad sore throat. On December 14 of that year, Washington died.
George Washington’s many astounding accomplishments ranged from a superior military career to helping found a new nation. As commander of the Continental Army, he led the United States to independence from Britain. As America’s first president, he set an example that every president since has tried to follow. He led with courage and confidence, and his style and personality demonstrated great personal character. The nation admired him then, and the world admires him today.

" We walk upstairs and stop in front of a large canvas that looks as if a kid had a paint-throwing tantrum. Chloe introduces it as a famous work by American artist Jackson Pollock, who helped establish a modern art movement called abstract expressionism. She explains that Pollock and other abstract expressionists rejected the usual subject matters and artistic methods. Pollock poured, splattered, and threw paint on canvases laid on the ground, not placed on an artist’s stand. Chloe tells us that pretty landscapes and realistic-looking people are not what makes good art. She says that seeing where the art comes from, what inspired it, and what effect the art has can help us decide what we think about it.

" Please, you know I HAVE to find him. We can’t leave him out here alone.” Visions of Bessie’s nightmare haunted her. “We don’t really have a choice,” said her father sadly, wishing he’d done more to discourage his daughter from becoming so attached to an animal.
“I think I have what you’re looking for,” said Jessie, who seemed to appear out of thin air with Wag trailing along behind him. “Wag, boy, you’re safe!” exclaimed Bessie as color returned to her cheeks for an instant, and she climbed down from the wagon despite her mother’s protests. Jessie explained that he’d found Wag hiding under his family’s wagon just before the buffalo herd stormed past. Wag nearly bolted out into the herd, but Jessie was able to coax him into the wagon, where he was content to play tug-of-war with a section of old rope Jessie had. Bessie scratched Wag behind his ears and looked warily at Jessie, who couldn’t help but crack a giant grin as Wag started to lick every inch of Bessie’s face. Bessie couldn’t help but giggle, which set Jessie to hooting. Wag happily swished his tail back and forth and nearly knocked Bessie over with his enthusiastic tongue bath.
“I don’t know what I would have done if you hadn’t saved Wag,” said Bessie, serious once more. “I know exactly how you feel,” Jessie said, pausing to remember the friends he’d most likely never see again. “When you’re feeling better, how about the three of us play fetch together?” he asked tentatively. “You bet,” agreed Bessie, figuring that if Wag thought this boy was all right, she could give him a chance, too. Having another friend with whom to spend time might make the demanding journey ahead a little easier to take—for both of them.",1116.0
" Russian forces constantly harassed the French army as it withdrew. Only about ten thousand able-bodied soldiers made it back to France. The disaster in Russia marked the beginning of the end for Napoleon. An alliance of nations surrounded Paris in 1814 and forced him to give up his throne. Napoleon was exiled to the Italian island of Elba. However, he escaped in early 1815 and raised a new army.
Napoleon met his final defeat at the Battle of Waterloo in Belgium on June 18 against a mixed force of Austrians, British, Prussians, and Russians. With this defeat, the Napoleonic Wars finally came to a close. France’s monarchy was then restored for a time, though it would later be replaced with a more representative form of government. Napoleon was exiled to the remote British island of St. Helena in the South Atlantic Ocean. He lived the rest of his life there and died in 1821. His body was later returned to France and buried in Paris.
Napoleon had a major influence on the later history of Europe. The ideas of his civil code spread to many other nations, which based their legal systems on them. The code led to the modern era of European politics. Napoleon’s legacy also included a new style of warfare where all parts of a nation devote themselves to supporting a war effort. His battle tactics and campaign strategies have since been studied at military schools around the world. His willingness to sacrifice lives and resources in pursuit of his ambition left France in shambles and a trail of destruction across much of Europe. Britain’s Duke of Wellington, who led the allied forces at Waterloo, was asked who he thought was the greatest general of all time. He answered, “In this age, in past ages, in any age—Napoleon!”",997.0
" “Thank you for giving me my mother back.” Part of me still wants to be angry for everything the Queen put us through, but she’s not that person anymore—she’s Mrs. Porter, who did everything she could to maintain a fantasy rather than face the agony of reality. My heart hurts when I think of everything she’s been through.
I kneel down and hug her too. “And for Uncle Jasper and Jake,” I say. Her arms are weak, but she hugs us tightly. I look up to see Thomas standing nervously next to us. I wave him over, and he joins in the embrace. Soon, all the children are in the hug, and it’s impossible not to feel the love emanating from them. As we finally pull away, I see Uncle Jasper shaking Seth’s tentacle. “We’ll come back to visit.” “I would like that,” Seth replies. Odie, who has been licking Jake’s face since they reunited a while ago, squirms free of Jake’s arms and bounds over to Seth. With his tail wagging, he gives a friendly bark and licks Seth’s face. “Farewell, mighty steed,” Seth says with a flinch and a laugh.
“Time to go,” Mrs. Porter says to us, her hand beginning to droop. We file through the doorway. I am the last, and as I take my final step, I turn in time to see the children gathered around Mrs. Porter in a close embrace. I can just see her face, and she looks truly happy. As I watch, the children dissolve into sand, gently covering their mother, and in the distance, I see hundreds of cephaloids joyfully swimming through the sparkling dunes. I step into the light, ready to return home, and feel myself becoming weightless.",799.0
" Morgiana addressed the captain of the soldiers, explaining, “There is a thief posing as an oil merchant at my master’s house. He schemes to release his men from these barrels and rob and murder us tonight.”
The soldiers laughed at this outrageous tale at first, but then they broke open one of the barrels to find a confused, and dizzy, robber armed to the teeth. As one group of soldiers set about opening the barrels and arresting the woozy robbers, Morgiana guided the captain and his men to the mansion.
Chapter 10
The thieves were tried and sent to faraway prisons, where their stories of a magical cave filled with plunder were treated as imaginative fairy tales.
As promised, Ali Baba gave Morgiana ample gold to return to her homeland and live the rest of her days comfortably. Vashti begged her to stay, promising her more riches and even the secret of the cave’s locale if she would continue as Vashti’s servant. Morgiana politely declined the offer and left. Being a shrewd woman, she used the gold to establish a trading business that kept her family affluent for generations to come.
Ali Baba, Fatima, and Vashti returned to the cave often. They passed its secrets on to their children, who lived satisfactorily with what remained of the treasure.
By the time Ali Baba, Fatima, and Vashti’s great-grandchildren were born, inevitably there was no treasure left. One enterprising great-grandchild made some money by showing people the wondrous moving rock, but the novelty soon wore off. He spent the rest of his days living in the empty cave. After he expired, no one remembered the magic words, and the rock never moved again.",1141.0
" The wood on either side was full of singular noises, among which—once, twice, and again—he distinctly heard whispers in an unknown tongue. His neck was in pain and lifting his hand to it found it horribly swollen. He knew that it had a circle of black where the rope had bruised it. His eyes felt congested; he could no longer close them. His tongue was swollen with thirst; he relieved its fever by thrusting it forward from between his teeth into the cold air. How softly the turf had carpeted the untraveled avenue—he could no longer feel the roadway beneath his feet! Doubtless, despite his suffering, he had fallen asleep while walking, for now he sees another scene—perhaps he has merely recovered from a delirium. He stands at the gate of his own home. All is as he left it, and all bright and beautiful in the morning sunshine. He must have traveled the entire night. As he pushes open the gate and passes up the wide white walk, he sees a flutter of female garments; his wife, looking fresh and cool and sweet, steps down from the veranda to meet him. At the bottom of the steps she stands waiting, with a smile of ineffable joy, an attitude of matchless grace and dignity.
Ah, how beautiful she is! He springs forwards with extended arms. As he is about to clasp her he feels a stunning blow upon the back of the neck; a blinding white light blazes all about him with a sound like the shock of a cannon—then all is darkness and silence! Peyton Farquhar was dead; his body, with a broken neck, swung gently from side to side beneath the timbers of the Owl Creek bridge.",1012.0
" Now there are all sorts of different flavors—some sugar-free, some hot and spicy, some even good for your teeth and breath.
William Wrigley Jr. added different flavors to his gum, making it taste better. His first flavors were called Lotta Gum and Vassar, and in order to get people to taste it, he sent a piece of it to one and a half million people—everyone listed in the United States phone books in 1892.
People loved it and started buying it. He became so rich from gum sales, he was able to buy a professional baseball team, the Chicago Cubs. He also built a stadium for them, Wrigley Field. Then, he bought an island off the coast of Southern California, Catalina Island, where he could relax and enjoy himself.
Would you like to make your own chewing gum? It may not be so easy. The first ingredient is a “gum base” which is usually made of latex, chicle, beeswax, or paraffin wax.
Melt the gum base until it is like a thick maple syrup. Then pour it through a fine mesh screen and into a mixing vat. Next, add the flavoring and coloring. Then, put the mixture on a cooling belt. When it is cool and set, roll it out, cut it into pieces, and put it aside for 24 hours before packing it. Got it? It might be easier for you to buy your own gum than to make it yourself.
So the next time you are chewing a stick of gum or waiting for a gumball to drop from a machine, think about where it came from, how it’s made, and how long people have been enjoying it—oh, and be sure to discard it properly, in the garbage (or on Gum Alley).",1006.0
" Most historians think the country was settled more than 5,500 years ago—making China one of the earliest civilizations in the world that is still thriving today. The capital of China is Beijing (BAY-jing). It is a city of almost 14 million people. Beijing is the center of government. It is also known for its many tourist sites, like Tiananmen (TEE-AHN-un-men) Square, also named the Gate of Heavenly Peace—a large square in the city’s center that is used for special events.
China also has many other thriving cities. Shanghai (shang-HI) is the largest city in China and one of the biggest ports in the world. And Hong Kong, in the southern part of China, is a major business center known for its many shops and markets. Even though many of China’s more than a billion people live in cities, most people still live in rural towns and villages. Many of them farm or herd sheep and goats in the grasslands.
Today, China has the second largest economy in the world. It is a leader in making and selling many products to other countries—from toys to televisions and textiles, such as silk. It also has a huge tourist industry and hosted the 2008 Olympics in Beijing.
But China faces big challenges. Recent reforms by the Communist government mean more private businesses will grow. The move away from a system where everyone works for the government means China has many unemployed workers. The “opening up” of the economy is expected to be better in the long term, but this kind of change does not come easily.
As China’s population grows, people will need more water, energy, food, and other resources. The country faces the challenge of providing enough jobs and resources for its population while still protecting the environment and people’s rights.",1040.0
" Dubai’s amazing building projects attract business and tourism, and Dubai is still building! Dubailand Park will have six different amusement parks in one area. When complete, it will be twice the size of Disney World.
In China, managing the water resources of areas that are either too dry or flood-prone has always been a challenge. Large northern cities, including Beijing, need more water than rain provides. The huge South-to-North Water Transfer Project will carry needed water along three different routes. Water will be moved from rivers and lakes where it is plentiful to Beijing and other high population areas where it is not.
The project will use a huge system of dams, canals, tunnels, and pumps running for hundreds of miles. Some tunnels will even move one river under another! This project dwarfs China’s last enormous project, the Three Gorges Dam. The Three Gorges Dam is the largest hydroelectric project in the world. This dam on the Yangtze River is 600 feet high and more than a mile and a half long. The dam protects cities downstream from flooding while it generates more electricity than any other hydroelectric plant in the world. Its reservoir may soon connect with the South-to-North Water Transfer Project.
Both the transfer project and the dam are controversial. Millions of people have had to move their homes to make way for the reservoirs and canals. Some historical sites may even be flooded—all to deliver water where it is most needed.
Unusually big problems can inspire the biggest dreams and the most imaginative solutions. The unique designs of these seven structures solved problems in several different countries and environments.

Low-lying coastlines in areas where earthquakes are common are most at risk for tsunamis. The Ring of Fire is a line of volcanoes stretching around the entire Pacific Ocean. Where there are volcanoes, frequent earthquakes occur with the movement of Earth’s crust. Indonesia is also an area where Earth’s crust moves often. Although we can’t predict the exact time or location of an earthquake, we can estimate when an area is overdue for one.
There is no practical way to protect property from tsunami devastation, but with early warning, we can save lives. When an earthquake occurs at sea, there is usually some time before the resulting tsunami reaches land. Unfortunately for the people of Banda Aceh, Indonesia, there were only a few minutes between the quake and the wave. It took about three or four hours for the tsunami to reach India and Sri Lanka. This would have been enough time to radio a message ahead. Governments and scientists are working to build warning systems for future tsunamis around the world.
On the Pacific Coast of the United States, a tsunami warning system is in place. Seismographs all along the Pacific Coast detect earthquakes. A tsunami warning is issued any time there is an earthquake of 6.8 in Alaska or 7.5 in the western United States. Buoys that are anchored at sea can detect a tsunami’s wave speed and direction and radio this information back to land. Radio messages and loud sirens warn people in seaside communities that a tsunami is coming. Signs along the highways label areas at high risk and suggest evacuation routes.
Earthquakes and tsunamis are scary reminders of the power of nature. We can’t prevent these events from happening, but we can prepare for them. Knowing what to do and getting an early warning can save lives.",1010.0
" The spaces may be filled with objects, colors, shapes, sounds, and lights to create a special atmosphere. Walk on in!
Long before we had written language, humans spoke through art. Simple drawings over 40,000 years old have been found scratched into rocks. Caves in France and Spain have primitive drawings of animals that were made over 13,000 years ago. In the ruins of ancient cities, scientists find pottery, wall murals, mosaics, and small carvings of animals and people.
Artists want you to see what they have created. Explore and discover. Visit an art museum or an art gallery, or walk through an art fair.
Look around you. Somewhere in your own town, you’ll find a tall outdoor sculpture, or a large mural on a wall. Many towns have set aside special areas for artists to display their work. Your town might even have a sculpture park where you can see several styles of art at one time.
Why not make your own art? You can create any type of art that you like. Use soft, colored chalk to draw on a sidewalk. Paint a picture of your pet and make a frame for it. Use clay, snow, or sand to make a sculpture. Tie little bunches of sticks together to make an animal shape and spray it with color. Glue pieces of shells, stones, and wood onto a picture frame for a photo of your family. It’s all art!
Artists use their artwork to tell a story or to express how they feel about something. But art doesn’t have to be serious or hard to do. Artwork can be interesting, or colorful, or funny, or simply beautiful to look at. The ability to see and enjoy art makes our lives more fun. Look for art around you. It’s everywhere!",744.0
" Many plants have developed ingenious ways to catch this fog. Some plant leaves gather droplets of fog and direct them toward their roots. Small “cloud forests” of these plants can grow in sheltered areas along the coasts where the fog is thick enough. Other than the cloud forests, almost no plant life grows in the Atacama. Some plants exist as dormant, or inactive, seeds that spring to life after a rain shower, which may come only once every ten years. There are few animals in the Atacama besides rodents and insects. The chinchilla, a popular new pet, lives here. Llamas and alpacas, furry relatives of the camel, can also be found in damp areas near rivers and high in the mountains.
But what the Atacama lacks in animals, it makes up for in minerals. The Andes are volcanic mountains, and their volcanic activity brought copper, nitrates (an ingredient in fertilizer and explosives), and sulfur to the surface. Salt is also abundant here in marshy lakes. Mining companies build entire towns for workers who dig up these minerals. Port cities spring up along the shore where the minerals are shipped around the world. All food and water must be trucked in or shipped by boat. Because of the desert’s unforgiving climate, miners are some of the very few people who have ever made their homes in the Atacama.
So, what can you find in the desert that you might not have expected? Lakes of salt, dense fogs, and underground oceans of oil? Ancient civilizations, expert horse herders, and mining towns? You may have thought of deserts as empty, lifeless places. But for thousands of years, plants, animals, and humans have known deserts as sources of life, riches, and wonder.",969.0
" In total, the strain of influenza known as the Spanish flu killed more than 600,000 Americans and 25 to 40 million people worldwide. An outbreak of this size is called a pandemic—a disease that spreads rapidly around the world.
The pandemic of 1918 was not the only major influenza outbreak in history. The Asian flu, which appeared in 1957, caused about 70,000 deaths in the United States. It got its name because it first appeared in China before coming to the United States in June 1957. Another strain of flu, the Hong Kong flu, was first seen in Hong Kong, China. In 1968, this virus caused another pandemic, killing 34,000 people in the United States—as many people as live in a small city. And in 2009, the H1N1 swine flu became the first pandemic in 41 years, infecting people in over 70 countries.
Other outbreaks, such as the Russian flu in 1977 and the avian flu in 1997 and 1999, caused worldwide concern but did not become pandemics. Both of these strains began in China and spread to other countries. Doctors are always looking for major outbreaks. If doctors can recognize outbreaks quickly enough, they can often keep them from becoming pandemics.
Influenza has been around for thousands of years. Because flu viruses can change and develop into new strains, influenza may never be wiped out. When you have the flu, the most important thing you can do is take care of yourself and keep others from getting sick. Wash your hands often and be careful not to cough or sneeze on other people. Drink water like a camel and sleep like a bear. Get vaccinated if you can. Most importantly, remember to attack back! Good food and rest will help the healthy cells in your body win the battle.",990.0
" Sympathy for Texans grew in the United States as news spread about the Alamo battle. Many Anglo Texans and U.S. citizens wanted revenge for the deaths of the men killed by Santa Anna’s troops. On April 21, 1836, Houston’s army surprised Mexican troops at San Jacinto. As they charged, the Texans shouted, “Remember the Alamo!” The battle lasted only 18 minutes. More than 600 Mexican soldiers were killed, and many others were wounded or taken prisoner. The Texas army lost only nine men.
Santa Anna was captured the next day. Texans wanted him killed, but Houston spared his life on the condition that he recognize Texas independence and take all his troops out of Texas. He agreed to do both. Later, the Mexican government refused to accept Texas independence, but Texans didn’t care. They considered themselves free and elected Sam Houston president of the Republic of Texas. Texas applied for U.S. statehood right away, but first it had to form a stable government of its own. Until it gained statehood in December 1845, it was considered an independent nation by the United States and many countries in Europe.
Texans and U.S. citizens had many reasons for fighting at the Alamo. Some fought to become rich landowners, others fought to keep slaves, and most believed they were fighting for freedom. Whether Anglo or Tejano, most people living in Texas wanted independence from Mexico’s dictatorship. In the United States, the battle of the Alamo is remembered as a symbol of heroism in the struggle for freedom. In Mexico, it is seen as part of a campaign to steal Mexican land. History is rarely as simple as right and wrong. Only by learning all viewpoints can we understand what truly happened at the Alamo.",1011.0

Anyone can visit Parliament and take tours, watch debates, and even have afternoon tea. United Kingdom residents can climb the 344 steps to the top of the Elizabeth Tower, where they get an amazing view of London. They can also view Big Ben and visit a special room where they can see exactly how the giant clock works. The clock was designed to mark time to within one second a month. The pendulum is adjusted using a stack of old British pennies. Adding or subtracting a penny changes the time by two-fifths of a second.
Over the centuries, Westminster has held many events, including huge feasts and parties. Many of these events happened when a new king or queen was being crowned. At King Richard III’s coronation in 1483, workers served huge amounts of food to three thousand people. Parliament has some old rules that are still around today. Since 1642, no English king or queen has been permitted to go inside the House of Commons. Also, no one may wear a suit of armor inside the Palace of Westminster. This law dates back seven hundred years.
People who live in the United Kingdom, as well as visitors, are familiar with the chiming of Big Ben. The bell rings every fifteen minutes. The chimes are heard live on TV at midnight every New Year’s Eve, and each November 11 the entire country stops for two minutes of silence. On that day, Big Ben rings at 11:00 a.m. to honor those who have lost their lives in wars. Since the time it was built, the palace has been popular with visitors to London. Today, thirteen million people visit the city each year. Westminster Palace, the Elizabeth Tower, and Big Ben are the most famous symbols of Britain.",947.0
" Because gold miners work so closely with mercury, they often become poisoned when they breathe in its fumes or touch the chemical with their bare hands or feet. Mercury poisoning can cause many health problems, including lung disease, kidney disease, shaking, blindness, and trouble walking and talking. People who have been poisoned may be in great pain and so sick that they can barely move. It can take years for people to recover from some of the effects of mercury poisoning, while others will never heal.
Many people are working to protect and preserve the rainforest. This is difficult work. Gold mining, logging, ranching, and other harmful activities are profitable and widespread throughout the Amazon region. Some governments in the Amazon region are spending more money to enforce laws and close down illegal mines. However, as long as poor people have few jobs and little money, they may want or need to mine gold. The best solution to the problem of rainforest destruction may be for governments to improve economic opportunities. For example, the government of Brazil has programs to improve the education and job skills of poor people. This allows them to get other jobs besides those that harm the rainforest.
Governments are not alone in protecting the rainforest. They have help from conservation organizations. These groups work with government agencies, businesses, and other organizations to study and conserve natural places. Continued efforts by both governments and conservation organizations are necessary to stop illegal mining and protect the rainforest. The Amazon region may seem far away, but its destruction affects the entire world.

" Lemmings and voles, two small rodents, instead store enough food to last during the coldest months. A blanket of snow helps keep their nests and tunnels warm. Some tundra animals, including reindeer and snow geese, leave during the coldest time of year. They migrate to warmer places where more food is available. In the alpine tundra, many animals migrate by traveling to lower, forested areas in winter. These include wildcats, some bird species, and three goat relatives—mountain sheep, chamois, and ibex. Marmots and ground squirrels hibernate in winter. Tiny rabbit relatives called pikas stay awake in winter and eat food they have stored until spring.
People have lived in the tundra for many thousands of years. At first, some of these groups were nomadic, moving with the seasons. Their livelihoods included hunting, fishing, and herding. Today, most of these peoples’ lives have changed. Many now live in towns and villages but still work to preserve their traditions. In recent years, modern settlements have appeared in parts of the tundra because of exploration for oil, gas, and minerals. Many people also travel to the tundra for outdoor activities such as skiing, hiking, and wildlife viewing.
If you visit the tundra, especially during the colder months, you might think it’s a wasteland. Frozen, empty plains or barren, windy slopes stretch for miles in every direction. However, the tundra has its own unique beauty. Look closely at the tiny plants. Although they look fragile, they are strong enough to live in one of Earth’s harshest places. Tundra animals, from lemmings to caribou, must also be tough to make their homes here. The wonder of this place lies in the amazing ways that plants and animals survive in this vast, frozen world.",963.0

Mahoney was declared dead a year later. His body was found on the side of a mountain in 1949, returned home, and buried in Stoughton. Sweet never married. Sixty-six years after his plane went down, Mahoney’s story came to light again through the work of eighteen-year-old Daniel Noyes. For his Eagle Scout project, Noyes decided to build 70 garden boxes for veteran memorial markers. He spent more than 250 hours building and placing the garden boxes throughout Stoughton with the help of his troop. For years, Sweet had kept a memorial at the street sign for Mahoney Avenue, but in her eighties was no longer able to continue. Instead, she made a donation to the project, asking that a garden box be built at Mahoney Avenue. Noyes and his father found the street but discovered there was no dedication sign, only a small American flag. Thanks in large part to Noyes’ project, Daniel Henry Mahoney Jr. now has an official memorial on the street sign that bears his name, a white Killed in Action marker with green writing. That recognition felt right to Noyes, to Sweet, and to Mahoney’s family.
Now that you’ve learned about Veterans Day, consider how you might honor veterans. There are many different ways: Visit a veteran at a Veterans Administration Hospital or community center.

" Other than in zoos, this rare species can only be found in the wild in Papua New Guinea—and only in the forest canopy. You watch in awe as the male feeds on a flower and flutters away. On your way down, something else catches your eye. You stop and pull yourself closer to a branch where an atlas moth sits, its wingspan 11 inches (27.9 cm) wide. The hooks on the ends of its wings remind you of this moth’s other name: the snake head moth. Unlike the Queen Alexandra’s butterfly, which lives up to three months or more and feeds regularly, the atlas moth lives only a few weeks and never feeds. You’ve seen this species before, as it’s fairly common throughout Southeast Asia, but it’s still an impressive sight.
Your final stop brings you to the London Natural History Museum. You have come to view the world’s longest insect: Chan’s megastick. One of only six found in the world so far (all of them in Borneo), this one is the longest. The whole insect, with its legs extended, stretches 22 inches (55.9 cm) under the glass. The body alone is 14 inches (35.6 cm) long. It really does look like a plain old stick, which might explain why scientists didn’t discover it until 2008. Like other stick insects, this species is believed to hide within the forest canopy while it feeds on leaves.
As you leave the museum, you begin to wonder how many new species of insects you passed during your travels.

" Most of Marie’s staff left to fight in the war, and her scientific research had to stop. Marie looked for ways to put her science to work to help the war effort. She provided portable X-ray machines for treating wounded soldiers on battlefields and set up more than two hundred X-ray stations. She also learned how to use X-ray equipment and taught herself to drive so she could run the X-ray machines herself.
After World War I ended, Marie worked nonstop to turn the Sorbonne’s Radium Institute into a world-class center for radioactivity research. Marie’s daughter Irene and her husband were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1935. Sadly, Marie didn’t live long enough to celebrate with them. We now know that radioactive substances are very dangerous, but that was not known during Marie’s life. She died at age sixty-six on July 4, 1934, from an illness often caused by being around radioactivity for a long time. Marie was buried next to Pierre. In 1995, their remains were moved to the Panthéon in Paris, where France’s most brilliant citizens are buried. Marie was the first and only woman to be buried there for her own achievements.
Marie Curie’s work caused a huge shift in scientific understanding of atoms and led to new treatments in medicine. It also led to the discovery of radiocarbon dating, a way to learn the age of ancient life forms. Marie showed that careful scientific research can yield amazing breakthroughs. She also showed the world how to stay strong in the face of difficult obstacles. In her words: “Life is not easy for any of us. But what of that?

" Rain and clouds coming toward land from a hurricane reflect different waves than rain and clouds headed away from land. A computer analyzes the differences in the waves to create a model of a storm. Scientists use the model to show the speed and direction of a storm.
Computers are used to predict hurricane movements. Thousands of measurements are typed into supercomputers to predict where a storm will go. As computers improve, we will be able to more accurately predict where hurricanes will hit land. This will save lives and reduce unnecessary evacuations. But computers will never be 100 percent accurate because weather systems are chaotic and are often difficult to predict.
Some researchers believe it is possible to stop hurricanes from forming or to redirect them. One possible way to do this is by seeding clouds in broad areas where hurricanes are born. During seeding, airplanes spray a fine mist of salt powder, which helps water condense out of the air. This would create many small clouds that would use up the energy that might be tapped by a single large storm to become a hurricane. The problem is that to be effective, clouds would have to be seeded over areas the size of Texas. No one yet has come up with a plan that would prevent a hurricane from forming.
Hurricanes are an awesome display of nature’s power. Satellites can tell us much about these storms, such as the direction a hurricane is moving and what areas need to be evacuated. We may be able to predict the path of hurricanes, but it is unlikely that we will ever be able to stop them. We can protect ourselves by planning where and how we build our homes, by keeping emergency supplies, and by being prepared to evacuate if necessary.",1049.0
" The temples at Abu Simbel, along the banks of Lake Nasser, are another popular tourist site. Two of the temples were built by Ramses II, pharaoh of Egypt from 1279 to 1213. Four giant stone statues of Ramses II sit at the entrance to the Great Temple, which was carved out of a cliff. Inside this temple, three hallways extend into the cliff and include more statues and painted scenes. The hallways lead to a shrine at the temple’s center dedicated to some of the Egyptian gods.
People in Egypt’s rural areas raise many animals, such as sheep, goats, donkeys, and water buffalo. Some people also raise and use camels for work. Some wild animals live in the harsh conditions of the deserts. One desert animal is the fennec, a small fox with large ears. The fennec spends most of its day underground in a burrow and comes out at night to find food. Many snakes, lizards, and scorpions also live in the deserts. The ibex (EYE-beks), a sturdy wild goat, is another animal that can survive in the deserts’ difficult conditions. The Nile and its valley are also home to many kinds of animals. Hundreds of different types of fish swim in the Nile’s waters, and crocodiles can be found in the southern part of the river.
Egypt is an amazing country filled with history. Both animals and people live in its rugged deserts. Cutting a path through the desert, the Nile River provides life-giving water and fertile land for crops. Throughout history, people have battled for control of the land of Egypt.

" The $100,000 cash used to pay workers is in the office when an armed robber breaks in and carries off the money. Crime scene investigators found no fingerprints in the office. The only piece of evidence left behind was the robber’s mask, a woman’s black nylon stocking. Unlike the overalls in Case No. 1, the stocking had no pockets or seams where trace evidence could be discovered.
When the robber pulled off his mask back in 1993, twenty-five of his skin cells came off with it. In 2004, eleven years later, scientists were able to make a DNA profile from the stored skin cells, which led police to a suspect named Andrew Pearson. At Pearson’s trial in 2004, a forensics expert showed that his DNA profile was an exact match for the profile from the skin cells on the robber’s mask. What were the chances that these skin cells could have come from another person and not Pearson? A billion to one, the expert said. Pearson was convicted of the 1993 robbery and sent to prison.
Each of the four cases in this book deals with a different kind of forensic evidence. There are other kinds of forensic evidence, too—footprints, shoe prints, palm prints, lip prints, bite marks, paint chips, tire tread marks, the markings on a bullet, and more. Any of these can link suspects to the scene of the crime, or can show who is innocent. Together, the law enforcement officers and scientists who gather and study forensic evidence use virtually all of the sciences, from anthropology to zoology, in their work. Whatever science they specialize in, they all have one thing in common. Like the fictional Sherlock Holmes, they use their knowledge to see what goes unnoticed by the rest of us.",1038.0

Alondra was an honor student at a public high school in San Francisco in the year 2000. Although she was a top student, Alondra struggled to graduate because her school had so many problems. Her high school didn’t have enough textbooks to go around, and there were no computers for students to use. Rats roamed the hallways, and the buildings were filthy. One day, Alondra visited another school where students had books, computers, and clean, safe buildings. That trip made Alondra realize that her school was very different from many other schools in her state.
Alondra decided to stand up for her rights. She joined almost one hundred other students in a lawsuit that forced the State of California to change the way it funded its public schools. The court that decided the case said that California was not giving “equal protection” to its students as required by the Fourteenth Amendment. It said that students like Alondra had a right to expect public schools in which they could get a good education.
The story of individual rights in America is not over. It began with the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. It continues to change through new laws, new amendments, and the actions of citizens who are willing to stand up for their rights. The Founders of the United States created a system that promised liberty and freedom to its citizens. It is up to all Americans to keep that promise alive.",1091.0
" They live in tile-roofed houses made of adobe, brick, and cement. Many make their living by catching shrimp for local restaurants. This water town is sometimes called the Mexican Venice. In summer during the rainy season, boats are the only way to travel through the streets. The local children have fun playing “water soccer” on the island’s only soccer pitch, which is underwater.
This modern city of 1.5 million people is on the North Island of New Zealand in the South Pacific Ocean. Auckland is located between two large harbors on an isthmus less than 2 kilometers (1.2 mi.) wide at its narrowest point. The harbors open to the Pacific Ocean to the east and the Tasman Sea to the west. Auckland’s nickname is the “City of Sails.” About one-sixth of Aucklanders own a boat, and the city has hosted the America’s Cup yacht race twice. Residents and visitors alike enjoy the thousands of beaches. Water-related activities include kayaking, parasailing, swimming, surfing, boating, fishing, diving, and beach horseback riding.
Many kinds of water cities exist besides the ones you’ve just read about. For instance, there’s a tiny Italian fishing town made up of a jumble of brightly colored homes that cling to steep, rocky cliffs. A floating community located in Northern California has fancy, simple, and vintage houseboats. Aircraft carriers—huge seagoing ships designed to launch aircraft—house thousands of people in the military for months at a time. Water represents different things to different people. For residents of water cities, it may mean recreation, a link to nature, or a way of life. It may also mean safety, survival, or an essential connection with the rest of the world. The remarkable diversity of water cities around the world is a testament to human adaptability and innovation.",1017.0
" Understanding more about the genetic makeup of humans can help scientists diagnose and treat genetically transmitted diseases. New medicines can be developed to fight the diseases. Genetics recently has helped law enforcement officers fight crime. Crimes have been solved by identifying criminals using their DNA from small samples of hair, skin, or fluid. The FBI has opened a national database of genetic information to help law enforcement keep track of and find criminals.
Genetics is also helping farmers increase the production of food crops to meet the demands of the world’s growing population. Scientists create grains, vegetables, and fruits that look better, last longer, have extra nutrients, and are more plentiful. Although many of these discoveries are very useful, some believe that tampering with genes may cause harm to our world. How will organisms that have been genetically altered affect our environment and us? This is something that scientists, and all of us, must think about.
So, just what is it that makes you, you? You now know that much of the way you look and the way you are is inherited from your parents. They pass down genes, or units of heredity, that have transferred traits from your grandparents to your parents, and then from your parents to you. There is a lot more to learn about genetics. Many people spend their entire lives studying genetics. Not only will understanding more about genetics be important in the future, it is also sure to be fun and interesting!",1040.0
" On this holiday, South Koreans celebrate everyone becoming one year older with gifts, games, and fortune-telling. A harvest celebration called Chuseok is another important holiday. It’s a time when people gather for family reunions. Families visit their family tombs and leave food offerings in honor of the dead. South Koreans also have a big celebration on a baby’s first birthday. The parents place objects in front of the baby and let the baby choose his or her favorite. If the baby picks up a book, he or she will be smart; picking up money means wealth.
South Korean food is often spicy. Kimchi, a food similar to spicy sauerkraut, and rice are served at nearly every traditional meal. Fish and other seafood are also an important part of South Korea’s cuisine, as are pounded rice cakes called tteok (DAWK).There is a saying in South Korea: “Food is the best medicine.” It means that both health and sickness come from the food people eat. Traditionally, South Koreans eat seaweed—which many believe improves health—on their birthday. Some women expecting babies eat seaweed to help ensure a healthy birth. Another traditional belief is that some foods have mystical powers. For example, a dish consisting of sweet red beans and rice porridge is supposed to chase off evil spirits and help ensure long life.
From their country’s bustling cities to its rugged mountains and fertile plains, South Koreans have been united for centuries by a culture that values hard work and respect for family and elders. This culture and the strength of the South Korean people have enabled the country to triumph over war and poverty. Today, the country’s trillion-dollar industrial economy is one of the strongest in the world. South Korea has become a modern world power—a country and people with a bright future.",964.0
" She told Ella to go on ahead, but Ella was hungry, too. Phoebe said she was just going to grab a hot dog from a street vendor. Ella said she’d come along. It was funny that such a huge star would be standing in the sidewalk in her fur coat, eating a hot dog. While they were eating, a man walked up to Ella and told her that she looked just like Ella Fitzgerald. Ella looked the man straight in the eyes and said that people told her that all the time before walking away, hot dog in hand.
A compassionate woman as well, Ella spent much of her time and money helping children whose lives presented them with many disadvantages. She helped open several day programs for children and participated in numerous fundraisers to benefit children. She and her second husband, Ray Brown, even adopted a child of their own, Ray Brown Jr. In later years, Ella was very devoted to her granddaughter, Alice.
Before she died in 1996 at the age of 79, Ella had sold over 40 million records and had performed at Carnegie Hall 26 times. She had appeared in movies and guest-starred on numerous television shows. She was the first black artist to headline at New York’s world- famous Copacabana club. She had been presented with the National Medal of Arts by the president of the United States, and awarded the French equivalent, the Commander of Arts and Letters Award. She held honorary doctorates in music from prestigious universities such as Yale, Princeton, and Dartmouth. Ella Fitzgerald, a homeless orphan from Yonkers, proved that humans can overcome adversity.

Returning to the front in August, Richthofen traded his Albatros biplane for a new Fokker triplane. The slow but highly maneuverable fighter featured three sets of wings and quickly became the aircraft with which he is most often remembered. Despite headaches from the incompletely healed wound and his growing distaste for the war, Richthofen continued to plague the Allies. On April 20, 1918, he scored his eightieth victory. It would be his last.
The next day, while engaged in combat above Allied lines, Richthofen was struck by a single bullet that pierced his heart. He managed to land safely and was pulled from his plane by Australian soldiers. According to one of the soldiers, the baron uttered one final word in German: kaputt (“done for”). He died moments later. Allied pilots gave Richthofen a funeral with full military honors at a French cemetery. A wreath placed on his coffin read, “To our gallant and worthy foe.” Richthofen’s body was transferred to Germany after the war. A controversy arose over who fired the bullet that struck Richthofen. Canadians insisted it was one of their own pilots, Captain Arthur Brown. However, many historians believe the fatal bullet came from an Australian gunner on the ground.
With eighty confirmed victories, Richthofen was the greatest ace of World War I. In later times, people would revere other commanding figures of the air war. The French remembered René Fonck, with seventy-five victories, and Canadians honored Billy Bishop, with seventy-two. Americans had a special place in their hearts for Eddie Rickenbacker, who shot down twenty-six enemy planes in just the final eight months of the war. Even so, in discussions of World War I aerial combat, the first name that comes to most people’s minds is Manfred von Richthofen—the legendary Red Baron.",1052.0
" The unconscious Lincoln was taken across the street to a private house. He died early the next morning. Booth was an actor and Southern sympathizer. He was also part of a group that sought revenge for the defeat of the Confederacy. They planned to kill not only Lincoln but also Vice President Andrew Johnson and Secretary of State William Seward. As it turned out, only Lincoln was assassinated, though Seward received serious knife wounds.
Union troops tracked Booth and another man, David Herold, to a farm in Virginia. Booth was shot to death, and Herold was taken prisoner. Herold and other sympathizers were later tried for their crimes. Four of them, including Herold, were found guilty and hanged.
Lincoln’s body was sent by a funeral train back to his home state of Illinois. He was buried in Springfield, the city where he had practiced law before entering politics. Although Lincoln was gone, he lived long enough to achieve his main goals: the preservation of the Union and an end to slavery.
The end of the Civil War also began the next chapter in the history of the United States. By December 6, 1865, the Thirteenth Amendment had been ratified by enough states to become law. Two more amendments—the Fourteenth and Fifteenth—giving former slaves civil rights and voting rights, were passed within the next five years.
Beyond freeing the slaves, the Civil War established the principle that the United States is an indivisible nation. States, whatever their feelings about their country, do not have the right to secede from the Union.
In the years since the Civil War, the nation has seen other times of great strain. Americans continue to be divided today on many issues, in many ways. Yet we remain one nation—the United States of America.",962.0

After the completion of his twelve labors, Hercules went on to accomplish numerous other heroic feats. He married a woman named Deianira, but this marriage was as ill-fated as his first marriage. When Hercules and his new wife were traveling, a centaur named Nessos offered to carry Deianira across a deep river. Midway across, Nessos attacked Deianira. Upon hearing his wife’s desperate and panicked screams, Hercules swiftly shot off an arrow that he had dipped into the poisonous blood of the Hydra. As Nessos bled to death, he rubbed his cloak into his blood, which had mixed with the poison. Offering his cloak to Deianira, he whispered, “In the future, if your husband ever wrongs you, give him this cloak, for it has been soaked in a special love potion.”
Later, when Hercules and Deianira had grown apart, she remembered the cloak. She handed it to Hercules, who wrapped himself in it and was instantly seized with unendurable pain. Hercules was wild with agony, but unable to wash the poison from his skin. He commanded a large pyre to be built. The great hero lay down in the midst of the flames, hoping to perish and end his torment. Zeus looked down upon the pyre from his home on Mount Olympus, deeply moved. Turning to his wife Hera, he said, “Has he not suffered enough? Let your anger be stilled.” Hera bowed her great head and agreed. After all, he was a son of Zeus, and he had proven that he was mighty and courageous beyond human expectations. The gods raised Hercules up, and he ascended in a pillar of fire to Mount Olympus, where he lived as a demigod forevermore.",951.0

Where Will They Meet?
The Union Pacific had a much easier time crossing the Rocky Mountains than the Central Pacific had crossing the Sierra Nevada. They took a gentle route called the South Pass, and they also moved quickly onto the deserts of Utah. By 1869, the two companies were approaching each other. Their meeting place would be at Promontory Point, Utah. On May 10, 1869, workers, railroad owners, journalists, and politicians gathered at Promontory Point for the completion of the Transcontinental Railroad. The race was over—the Union Pacific had laid 1,086 miles (1,748 km) of track, and the Central Pacific had laid 689 miles (1,109 km), though the Central Pacific got extra money for building through the mountains.
To celebrate the completion of the first railroad to cross the United States, the heads of the two companies would drive the last four spikes into the track. The spikes were made of gold and silver. Workers from both companies dragged the last rails into place. Leland Stanford, the head of the Central Pacific, and Thomas Durant, head of the Union Pacific, both took up sledgehammers. They carefully aimed—and missed! But the telegraph reporters sent out the signal anyway. The Transcontinental Railroad was complete.
Suddenly, California was a few days of travel away from New York, instead of months. Railroads soon stretched to Salt Lake City, Oregon Territory, and the Southwest. Towns sprang up along the track now that trains could bring passengers, supplies, and mail quickly and safely. The Union Pacific and the Central Pacific made millions of dollars, because every railroad town had to buy land from them. The end of the Civil War had reunited the country from north to south. And for the first time, a transcontinental railroad united the country from east to west.",1020.0

“Oh, ah, yes, of course, the Mole and the Badger,” said Toad, lightly. “What’s become of them, the dear fellows? I had forgotten all about them.” “Well may you ask!” said the Rat reproachfully. “While you were riding about the country in expensive motorcars, and galloping proudly on blood horses, and breakfasting on the fat of the land, those two poor, devoted animals have been camping out in the open, in every sort of weather, living very rough by day and lying very hard by night; watching over your house, patrolling your boundaries, keeping a constant eye on the stoats and the weasels, scheming and planning and contriving how to get your property back for you. You don’t deserve to have such true and loyal friends, Toad, you don’t, really. Some day, when it’s too late, you’ll be sorry you didn’t value them more while you had them!” “I’m an ungrateful beast, I know,” sobbed Toad, shedding bitter tears. “Let me go out and find them, out into the cold, dark night, and share their hardships, and try and prove by— Hold on a bit!

" He had trained it, probably by the use of the milk which we saw, to return to him when summoned. He would put it through this ventilator at the hour that he thought best, with the certainty that it would crawl down the rope and land on the bed. It might or might not bite the occupant, perhaps she might escape every night for a week but sooner or later she must fall a victim. I had come to these conclusions before ever I had entered his room. An inspection of his chair showed me that he had been in the habit of standing on it, which of course would be necessary in order that he should reach the ventilator.
“The sight of the safe, the saucer of milk, and the loop of whipcord were enough to finally dispel any doubts which may have remained. The metallic clang heard by Miss Stoner was obviously caused by her stepfather hastily closing the door of his safe upon its terrible occupant. Having once made up my mind, you know the steps which I took in order to put the matter to the proof. I heard the creature hiss as I have no doubt that you did also, and I instantly lit the light and attacked it.” “With the result of driving it through the ventilator.” “And also with the result of causing it to turn upon its master at the other side. Some of the blows of my cane came home and roused its snakish temper, so that it flew upon the first person it saw.

" The two men were hailed as heroes. Benjamin Franklin observed the historic flight. Asked by another spectator what this balloon was good for, he reportedly answered, “What is the good of a newborn baby?” On December 1, just ten days after the Montgolfiers’ triumph, Jacques Charles and Nicolas-Louis Robert made the first human ascent in a hydrogen balloon. Taking off from the Tuileries (TWEE-luh-reez) Garden in Paris, they flew for more than two hours, coming down in a town about 36 kilometers (22 mi.) away. In the following years, the Montgolfiers launched several more balloons. The brothers were honored by the French Academy of Sciences, and their father, Pierre, was elevated to nobility by King Louis.
The passion for ballooning soon spread throughout Europe. It was not long, however, before the risks involved became clear. In June 1785, de Rozier and his copilot, Pierre Romain, were killed while attempting to fly across the English Channel in a balloon. Despite the risks, pioneers continued to develop balloon designs long after the initial balloon craze of the late 1700s had ended. In the 1800s, lighter-than-air vehicles were equipped with rudders and motorized propellers. By the 1930s, huge airships were flying passengers back and forth across the Atlantic Ocean. The golden age of airships ended abruptly in 1937, though, when the German airship Hindenburg caught fire and crashed while landing in New Jersey. Today, airships are mostly used for advertising and can often be seen flying above open-air stadiums during large sporting events. Gas balloons are mostly used for gathering weather data, while hot-air balloons are mostly used for recreation. Many areas hold festivals each year in which hundreds of colorful hot-air balloons fill the sky. These events can make it appear as though balloon mania never ended.",1103.0
" “What do you think you’re doing?!” she heard her uncle holler as he ran from the house toward the corral. Pepper jerked and stepped as the shouting man approached. “Please,” she whimpered, “please don’t startle him.” Trisha’s uncle leapt easily over the fence and walked toward the nervous horse, grunting and whistling commands she’d never heard before. He gingerly took the reins and held them tightly, offering his other hand to help Trisha down and brush the dust from her face when she finally touched the ground again. Then he held her chin, lifting her face until he saw into her eyes.
“Please don’t be mad,” Trisha pleaded. “We didn’t mean to do anything wrong—” “Trisha, I want you to think about everything that went through your head the moment before you got on that horse. Now, are you going to look into my eyes and tell me it never occurred to you that you were doing something wrong?” “No, sir,” Trisha said, dropping her head. “Remember that the next time you’re about to do something you’re not allowed to do. I’m pretty sure you didn’t take out that horse and saddle him up all by yourself, especially when I saw Adrian run off and hide in the barn. You skip right under that fence and go back in the house while I fetch him.” Trisha did as she was told, slipping through the fence and starting toward the house while her uncle ran after his son.

" These players draw fans to the sport who often talk as much about the players’ lively personalities as they talk about their talent. Players such as Michael Jordan, Larry Bird, Shaquille O’Neal, Magic Johnson, and LeBron James were human record-breaking machines. Off the court, players often become famous personalities, but on the court, few stars fail to prove their amazing basketball skills.
In the WNBA, Brittney Griner overcame her early difficulties to break records and attract attention as one of the best female athletes in the sport. Four-time United States team member and University of Connecticut star Breanna Stewart has been named Player of the Year more than once and has helped United States national teams win four gold medals. These players and many more have given a lot to the sport, but perhaps one player helped to shape modern basketball more than any other. In the 1950s, a 6-foot-10-inch (208 cm) player named George Mikan brought to the game great ability and love of the sport itself. He was the first of the “big men” who changed basketball from being a sport of small and quick players into that of giants. Present-day basketball would be very different without Mikan’s talent.
No matter how talented the player, everyone must work together to get the balance that makes for success. Watching a team play like a well-oiled machine is the reason most fans pack arenas everywhere. Tomorrow’s basketball stars are practicing now on basketball courts around the world. Whether they are competing in school leagues or simply shooting hoops with neighbors in the park or a driveway, the more they play, the better they will get. Anyone who wants to play basketball can just pick up a ball and look for the nearest hoop.",1208.0
" They feed on rotting plant matter in the soil. They may also eat smaller beetle larvae and adult insects. Goliath larvae reach full size in about four months. The larger species can grow up to 5 inches (12.7 cm) in length—about as long as a dollar bill. They can weigh up to 3.5 ounces (100 g)—about the same as five mice.
When the wet season ends, the larvae burrow deeper underground until they reach sandy soil. There, they build thin-walled “cells” similar to butterfly cocoons. Inside each cell, over the next several months, a larva’s body goes through changes and turns into its adult form. Wings and legs grow and fold into place, and the outside of the body hardens into a protective shell.
The adult Goliath beetle remains in hibernation inside the earthen cell until the end of the dry season. When the wet season begins again, moisture seeps through the ground. When it reaches the cell, the hibernating beetle wakes and the cycle begins again. In captivity, adults can survive about eight months. In the wild, though, Goliath beetles must find food and escape enemies. For these reasons, their life in the wild is probably much shorter. Scientists think that monkeys and large birds might eat Goliath beetles—if they can catch them. Goliath beetles do such a good job of hiding in treetops that no one knows for sure.
Most of us have probably never seen insects larger than a grasshopper. Imagine his reaction when a navy doctor fished the first-known Goliath beetle from an African river in 1766. Since then, these giant beetles have interested insect fans everywhere. No wonder! With their enormous size and flashy stripes, Goliath beetles are a sight to behold.

The following year, Frazier tried to win the title back from Ali in a fight held in the Philippines called the “Thrilla in Manila.” It was a tough fight that Ali called “the closest I’ve come to death.” In the fourteenth round, Ali used the last of his strength and threw everything he had at Frazier. Frazier gave up. Both men were so beaten up that Ali later said, “We went to Manila as champions, and we came back as old men.”
Ali kept his title for another two and a half years before he lost it to Leon Spinks, but he fought Spinks again a few months later and won. He’s still the only boxer to win the heavyweight crown three times. But in his next fight, Ali lost the title for good to Larry Holmes. At thirty-eight, his long career in the ring came to an end.
After retiring from boxing, Ali traveled the world speaking up for human rights. In 1984, he learned he had Parkinson’s disease. This disease makes it hard for the brain to control the muscles. But in 1996, he returned to the Olympic Games to light the Olympic flame in Atlanta. Ali struggled to lift the torch, but as the crowd cheered he held the flame aloft, a fighter to the end.

Human activities are not the only causes of wildlife injuries. Natural disasters, such as wildfires and hurricanes, hurt animals, too. Terri Crisp spends much of her time rescuing animals that are affected by natural disasters. During a raging California wildfire in 1986, Terri rescued a Shetland pony by coaxing it into a car. She worked to save sea otters and loons in 1989 during the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska. In 1992, she worked to rescue hundreds of animals hurt by Hurricane Andrew. She started the organization Noah’s Wish to train volunteers to rescue animals that are in danger because of natural disasters.
Incredibly, many wild animals knew to run inland before the 2004 Asian tsunami hit land. However, pets and farm animals did not fare so well. Many people in the areas hit by the tsunami depended on working farm animals. Large numbers of these animals were killed, and many others were injured or left in places without food when the tsunami struck. The Humane Society International and others help the animals, and the people who care for them, get their lives back on track.
Rehabbers often use animals that cannot go back to the wild as ambassadors to help teach people to respect wildlife. Children and adults learn about wildlife that live in their area and about respecting the land so that wild animals can continue to find food and shelter. Wildlife rehabbers do important work in caring for injured wild animals and returning many of them to the wild.

" Perhaps by the time the Ancient Puebloans left Mesa Verde, they had cut down most of the trees for firewood and for building pueblos. Hunters may have killed so many wild animals that the meat supply was gone. Some people think that enemy tribes drove out the cliff dwellers. However, that is unlikely, because there are no remains of other cultures at Mesa Verde after the Ancient Puebloans left. Archaeologists find older remains deeper in the ground and newer remains closer to the surface. If enemies drove out the cliff dwellers, evidence of their culture would be found on top of the Ancient Puebloan remains.
When the ancient cliff dwellers left Mesa Verde, some moved south, settling along the Rio Grande River in New Mexico. These are the ancestors of the modern Pueblo tribes. Others moved to Arizona, eventually forming the Zuni and Hopi tribes. Modern tribes have continued many of the traditions of the ancient cliff dwellers. The Pueblo, Zuni, and Hopi peoples continue to farm, conduct ceremonies, and perform rituals. They still honor their connection with the land and the spirit world. They are among the finest artists in the world, creating exquisite pottery, jewelry, baskets, carvings, and weavings.
Protecting the Cliff Dwellings In the late 1800s, many people visited the cliff dwellings—some photographed, drew, and described the sites, but others took artifacts from the dwellings to sell. Over time, people became concerned about protecting the cliff dwellings from damage and looting. The concern led to the creation of Mesa Verde National Park in 1906. The National Park Service protects the cliff dwellings, as well as allowing visitors to enjoy them. Educational exhibits at Mesa Verde and other sites in the Southwest teach people about the Ancient Puebloan way of life.",1070.0
" One of those code talkers, Keith Little, described his contribution to the battle: “My weapon was my language, and that language probably saved countless lives.”
The Navajo code talkers played an important role in several battles fought in the Pacific during World War II. The Japanese could not make heads or tails of the code. Even after Japan surrendered to the United States on September 2, 1945, the code remained a government secret. The code talkers could not speak about their experiences. They remained silent for years. The code talkers’ loyalty and patriotism were especially noteworthy given the difficult lives they returned to after the war. Jobs were hard to find for many former soldiers, and Native Americans often faced discrimination. Although the United States had extended citizenship to all Native American people in 1924, many tribes were denied the right to vote by individual states. The right to vote wasn’t actually guaranteed to all Native Americans until forty years later.
Finally, in 1968, the secrecy surrounding the code talker program ended. The world then learned about the amazing contributions of these men. In December of 2000, President Clinton signed a law awarding the Congressional Gold Medal to the twenty-nine original Navajo code talkers. In a 2001 ceremony at the U.S. Capitol, President Bush presented medals to four of the five surviving members of that group. The unusual Navajo language and the honorable actions of the code talkers contributed to the success of the code and, in turn, to victory during the war. To this day, it is the only spoken military code that has never been broken.",1109.0

" The Aztecs believed that the Sun god needed blood from human hearts to stay strong. Without human blood, the Sun would die and the world would come to an end. Human sacrifices of prisoners taken in war were a regular part of Aztec life, and these sacrifices took place at the Great Pyramid Temple.
Cultures in northwestern South America also built flat-topped, stepped pyramids. The Moche people, who flourished between 100 and 800, built the Pyramid of the Sun and the Pyramid of the Moon. About 600 to 700 years later, the Inca people built pyramids. The Temple of the Sun was the most sacred shrine in the Incan empire. It contained a huge gold disk that symbolized the Sun god. The Incas believed that their rulers were direct descendants of the Sun. The pyramid shape has been used in building designs in other cultures around the world. Pyramid designs can be found in parts of Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. The pyramid shape is used in modern architecture in many countries, including France, England, and the United States. A modern pyramid was built in Egypt to honor President Anwar Sadat, who was assassinated in 1981.

She took hold of the chubby hand and pulled her close to her side with a coaxing little laugh. “I will be your mama,” she said. “We will play that you are my little girl. And Emily shall be your sister.” Lottie’s dimples all began to show themselves. “Shall she?” she said. “Yes,” answered Sara, jumping to her feet. “Let us go and tell her. And then I will wash your face and brush your hair.” To which Lottie agreed quite cheerfully, and trotted out of the room and upstairs with her, without seeming even to remember that the whole of the last hour’s tragedy had been caused by the fact that she had refused to be washed and brushed for lunch and Miss Minchin had been called in to use her majestic authority. And from that time Sara was an adopted mother.",857.0

In 2017, he hopes to expand throughout the state of North Carolina. William says, “I’m just an involved, regular kid. Any kid can make a difference if they want to. It’s just whether they want to or not.” I’m just an involved, regular kid. Any kid can make a difference if they want to. It’s just whether they want to or not.
What Can I Do?
If you have a family garden, you can donate extra produce to a local food pantry—or plant an extra patch of vegetables to donate! You can also donate part of your allowance and encourage others to do the same. Kids in Loudoun County, Virginia, came up with a plan to allow kids to donate a dime to the food bank each time they bought lunch. Encourage a school campaign to buy products to support food banks.
Look around your community. Find out what the local food bank and charities need and at what time of year the need is greatest. Share what you find with friends, family, and neighbors. Most people don’t know a lot about hunger in their own communities. Let them know by writing a letter to your local newspaper. Write a report on hunger in your community and present it to your class. Write letters to your representatives in Congress and to your state and local governments. Encourage them to support programs that help make sure no child goes hungry. Start a letter-writing campaign at school to tell government officials what you think.We have the resources to ensure that children like Mario never go hungry again. We just need the will to make it happen.",841.0
" However, it is quickly becoming a modern country, filled with opportunity. In 2007, India elected its first female president. It is the world’s largest democracy.
India’s wildlife includes many exotic species, including large cats. In fact, India is the only country in the world with both lions and tigers. It is also the home of two kinds of leopards. While both types of leopards are rare, the snow leopard of the Himalayas is far scarcer. One of India’s most famous reptiles is the cobra, a poisonous snake known for spreading its hood when it feels threatened. Because it hunts mice and rats, which live close to humans, the cobra does sometimes bite people.
The Indian elephant was once prized for its strength and helped to clear many forests in India. People used elephants to lift logs and to transport crops and people. Today, some Indians still use elephants to help them with their work. Wild elephants are found in most regions of India, but they are threatened by habitat loss. Along the Bay of Bengal, the mangrove forests in the swampy Sundarban provide a unique habitat for many animals. The Sundarban is the home of sea turtles, sharks, and crocodiles. It is also the largest home of Bengal tigers, and the tigers actually swim in the swamp’s waters to catch prey. A male Bengal can grow to 3 meters (10 ft.) in length and weigh as much as 230 kilograms (500 lbs).
India is a large country filled with many people and exotic animals. The country has been faced with enormous challenges, such as feeding and housing its population while protecting its amazing natural beauty. At the same time, India continues to grow, becoming an important player on the world stage.",946.0
" Cook observed the stars as he sailed, and whenever he came to a new land, he learned as much as he could about its plants and animals. His work broadened the European understanding of the world. Cook kept his crew healthy by making them eat foods such as limes and cabbages. Until Cook’s time, up to one-half of the crew on a long voyage would die of scurvy or other diseases. Cook knew his success as an explorer depended on keeping his crew in good health. Soon, all British sailors knew that they needed to eat vitamin C to survive. Sadly, although Cook attempted to remain diplomatic and friendly wherever he went, he was killed in a fight in Hawaii in 1779.
By the mid-1800s, sailors had explored and mapped most of the world’s coastlines. Very fast sailing vessels called clipper ships carried people across oceans in a matter of days. One clipper, Sir Lancelot, set a record by sailing from Australia to England in three months. Some of these ships had as many as thirty-five sails, and they could travel even in light breezes. By the 1870s, however, the steam engine largely replaced wind power. The industrial revolution swung into full gear, and machines became more significant to everyone. Bigger and faster ships than had ever been imagined suddenly became possible. Today, steam power is outdated, and ships run on different types of engines. Some submarines and aircraft carriers even run on nuclear power! Cruise ships carry thousands of people at a time like floating cities. When we look at some of the ships used by early explorers to sail across oceans, we have to admire their courage and their ingenuity. Explorers and their ships of discovery helped create the world we live in.",1028.0
" There often was not enough food, water, or blankets for the passengers. Many died, and many of those who survived arrived in America sick and weak.
The potato blight was over by 1852, but Ireland was changed forever. A million people had died, and over a million had emigrated. Many people who stayed in Ireland were homeless and jobless. The landlords could not make money, so they sold the land for other purposes or simply abandoned it rather than pay high taxes. With no land and no jobs, many Irish people continued to emigrate over the next decades. By 1861, the population of Ireland had dropped from over 8.5 million to 5 million; more than one in three people were gone. Ten years later, the population had dropped even further to 4.5 million. Many Irish people blamed Britain, the most powerful country in the world at that time, for not helping more. This bitterness would help fuel the revolution that finally split Ireland into two countries in 1922.
Scientists eventually discovered that the potato plants died of a disease called late potato blight, which was caused by the funguslike organism Phytophthora infestans. Spores from the organism were blown by wind and washed into the soil by rain. Even after the Great Hunger, as the famine was called in Ireland, Irish immigration to the United States continued. Over five million people arrived between 1850 and 1920. Some ran for political office, and others started businesses. Famous Americans, including President John F. Kennedy and inventor Henry Ford, had ancestors who came to America during the famine. Today, forty million Americans proudly claim Irish roots, celebrate its folk traditions and holidays, and continue to popularize Irish literature, music, and film as an established part of world culture.",1082.0

“He rescued the greater part of the Jewish children of my generation in Czechoslovakia,” Gissing has said. “Very few of us met our parents again: They perished in concentration camps. Had we not been spirited away, we would have been murdered alongside them.”
As many as 5,000 people are now descendants of the 669 children who rode Winton’s trains to safety in 1939. Although those children are now old, many still call themselves “Winton’s Children.”
Winton’s work has earned him many honors from the governments of both Great Britain and the Czech Republic. In 2002, he was made a knight by Queen Elizabeth II, an award given to people for acts of bravery, service, or success.
In 2009, to mark the seventieth anniversary of Winton’s last train, a trip repeated the journey that Winton’s Children made between Prague and London. The train followed the same path; on board were many of those Winton had saved. Winton greeted the group himself at London’s Liverpool Street station with open arms. The trip came a few months after Winton celebrated his 100th birthday.
After his secret was revealed, Winton spoke often about his decision to save the Czech children. He claimed that he did nothing special or heroic. He said that’s why he never talked about it.  “I just saw what was going on and did what I could to help,” he once said.  To thank Winton for his actions, some of the people he saved gave him a ring. It’s inscribed with a line from a book of Jewish laws known as the Talmud. It reads: “Save one life, save the world.” Sir Nicholas Winton died on July 1, 2015, the 76th anniversary of a train journey that carried the largest number of children from Prague—241.",951.0
" Louis raised an army and invaded England. In 1216, there were completely unexpected developments. Pope Innocent died in July from a fever. In October, John also died, felled by the illness dysentery while confronting Louis’s forces.
John’s nine-year-old son, Henry III, then became king. Marshal, now aged seventy, became regent—administrator of the government—as Henry was still too young to manage affairs on his own. As regent, Marshal advised Henry to reissue the charter and prove to the barons that he was not like his father.
Marshal once again proved his worth to the English throne. In 1217, he brought the rebel barons to heel and ejected Prince Louis from England. Henry reissued the Great Charter, pacifying the barons who had doubted that his reign would differ much from John’s. They trusted Marshal’s word that the king would abide by the charter. Henry turned eighteen in 1225. That year, he again reissued the Great Charter, thereby reinforcing his pledge to be a law-abiding ruler. Henry accepted that no one was above the law—not even the king of England. The charter was reissued one more time, in 1297, during the reign of Henry’s son, King Edward I.
The Great Charter became a powerful symbol of liberty and the principle that no one is above the law. It served as the basis for English Common Law, England’s legal system. According to the charter, people charged with a crime must be treated as innocent until proven guilty in a trial by jury. Many of the ideas presented in the charter deeply influenced political thinking in Europe. They also influenced the American colonies in the 1700s, when they broke away from British rule to create the United States. Many of those same ideas found new expression in the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights.",1033.0

Morgiana addressed the captain and explained, “There is a thief posing as an oil merchant at my master’s house. He schemes to release his men from these barrels and rob and murder us tonight.” The soldiers first laughed at this outrageous tale, but then they broke open one of the barrels to find a confused, and dizzy, robber armed to the teeth. As one group of soldiers set about opening the barrels and arresting the woozy robbers, Morgiana led the captain and his men to the mansion.
Chapter 10
The thieves were tried and sent to faraway prisons, where their stories of a magical cave filled with plunder were treated as imaginative fairy tales. As promised, Ali Baba gave Morgiana ample gold to return to her homeland and live the rest of her days comfortably. Vashti begged her to stay, promising her more riches and even the secret of the cave’s locale if she would continue as Vashti’s servant. Morgiana politely declined the offer and left. Being a shrewd woman, she used the gold to establish a trading business that kept her family affluent for generations to come. Once Morgiana had departed, Ali Baba, Fatima, and Vashti returned to the cave again and again, taking more and more riches. They passed its secret location and the magic words needed to enter it on to their children, who lived satisfactorily with what remained of the treasure. By the time Ali Baba, Fatima, and Vashti’s great-grandchildren were born, inevitably there was no treasure left.
One enterprising great-grandchild made some money by showing people the wondrous moving rock, but the novelty soon wore off. He spent the rest of his days living in the empty cave. After he expired, there was no one left to remember the magic words, and the rock never moved again.",1146.0

How Do They Do It?
How do animals find their way when they migrate? Although scientists don’t have all the answers yet, they are learning more every year about the mysteries of migration. Some animals, such as salmon, use their sense of smell to find the stream where they were first born. Others, such as indigo buntings and other night-flying birds, use the stars to guide their way. Day-flying birds use the sun and also watch for special landmarks, such as coastlines and mountains, to stay on course.
Scientists are still exploring other ways that animals navigate. They believe some animals are able to sense Earth’s magnetic pull to guide them.
One of the most interesting yearly migrations is that of monarch butterflies. These bright orange and black butterflies travel from the northern and eastern parts of North America to Mexico and southern parts of the United States. They spend winter on specific trees in the mountains. In the spring, the adults return north, breeding along the way. The adults die after the females lay eggs. The eggs develop into young butterflies that complete the journey back home.
Many marine creatures also migrate—from huge humpback whales to lobsters, sharks, sea turtles, and tuna. Some, such as many of the sea turtles, follow ocean currents to get from one part of the vast ocean to another. But scientists still don’t know how these creatures find exactly the right beach to lay their eggs—the same one they hatched on years before.
Every year, millions of animals move from one place to another to find food, water, better weather, or a place to nest or raise their young. Some travel alone, but others travel in huge flocks or herds. But no matter how they travel, they all take the magical journey of migration.",947.0
" The best part about most of these parades is that anyone can participate.
Día de los Muertos was always a happy day for Lidia because she spent it remembering those she loved. Lidia lives in the United States now. She and her family march in the Tucson parade every year to honor their ancestors. Lidia wears a colorful Mexican dress that she sewed and a grinning skeleton mask. Walking in the parade reminds her of celebrating Día de los Muertos when she was a little girl.
In the days before the parade, Lidia makes special masks for children and adults to decorate. She shreds newspaper and soaks it in water. She mixes the wet newspaper with flour and glue to make a paper pulp. Lidia turns the paper pulp into masks. When the masks are dry, children and adults paint them to look like skeletons or other creatures. Some add sparkles and flowers to their masks, which they then wear in the parade.
Marching in a parade is just one way to remember loved ones who have died. Día de los Muertos has many old traditions that people take part in to honor the dead.
Some people build special altars in their homes to welcome the spirits of loved ones. Building an altar is an important part of Día de los Muertos. The beautiful altars are covered with fabric and decorated with photos of the person who has died. The altars might include a favorite piece of clothing that the loved one wore or an item he or she treasured.
Some artists paint colorful pictures of skeletons in honor of Día de los Muertos. Paintings show grinning skeletons dancing, playing guitars, and celebrating. The art is a way to celebrate friends and family members who have died.",831.0
" He had canals built and the swampy areas filled in with soil. In June, people celebrate White Nights by taking allnight walks along the city’s canals and many drawbridges.
If you were to travel to these same cities on the winter solstice (December 21 in the Northern Hemisphere), you would experience very different conditions. The winter solstice is the shortest day of the year. At that time of year, places along this latitude get only about five hours of daylight per day, and it’s dark and cold. High temperatures in coastal cities are in the 20s (Fahrenheit).
Because they are all near large bodies of water, the four cities you visited are still much warmer in winter than towns located farther inland. Away from the coasts, winter high temperatures average only about 5 degrees Fahrenheit at this latitude. Winters are so long and cold that, in some places, the ground never completely thaws during the short summers, resulting in permafrost. Permafrost makes construction of roads and buildings very difficult.
One nice thing about visiting the subarctic region during the winter months is that you can sometimes see the aurora borealis, or northern lights. These natural displays of light in the evening skies are caused by powerful electrical discharges high in the atmosphere. In southern latitudes, this display is known as the aurora australis.
I hope you enjoyed our summer trip to 60 degrees north latitude. The temperatures were warm, and the days were long. That’s because the Northern Hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun during summer, which extends the time between sunrise and sunset. The four countries you visited on this trip have very different cultures. But in each location, people celebrate the summer solstice, the day of the year with the most sunlight.",1100.0
" This allows a catamaran to travel faster than most ships with only one hull.
Although large, modern boats with gasoline or diesel engines are everywhere, people still use smaller boats for fishing, fun, and sport. It is almost impossible to look at a river, lake, or ocean, and not see a variety of boats. Many smaller boats still use paddles, oars, or sails, just as the earliest boats did.
Some modern ships are very large. Cruise ships are like floating hotels. They can carry thousands of people to exotic destinations all around the world. Huge tankers carry oil and gas over the ocean. Oil tankers are very large ships that are often over 304.8 meters (1,000 ft) long. The largest oil tanker in the world is over 457.2 meters (1,500 ft) long—that’s longer than the Empire State Building in New York is tall!
Some boats and ships are designed to do special work. Tugboats push and pull larger ships in places where they can’t move themselves. Tugboats also guide very large boats to dock when there is little room to maneuver a big boat. Fireboats help put out fires on other ships. Ferryboats carry cars and people short distances.
Navies use many types of ships and boats, large and small, to defend their coastal areas. Military transport ships carry soldiers around the world. Submarines hide under the surface of the water. Aircraft carriers serve as floating runways and allow planes and helicopters to fly anywhere in the world. Cruisers and destroyers patrol coastal waters.
Ships and boats have played an important part in the advancement of civilization. For thousands of years, they have allowed people to explore their world and travel to places that were once out of reach. They are still an important way to move people and things quickly over the water.",919.0
" Many people in North and South America didn’t like the big birds, so they shot them. People also didn’t like coyotes and wolves, so they left poison out to kill them. When the condors ate the dead animals, they died from the poison, too. Many condors died of lead poisoning, too. They would feast on animals people had shot and sometimes accidentally eat lead bullets. In more recent times, electrical power has also proved a danger to condors. As sharp as condors’ eyesight is, they can’t always see power lines, so they fly into the wires and die. In 1987, California condors were dangerously close to extinction—only about ten were alive in the wild. Scientists captured the wild birds and brought them to refuges. There, the scientists could protect them and help the birds raise their young.
After five years of hard work and dedication, scientists began releasing California condors back into the wild. By May 2013, over 230 California condors were flying free again. Since 1973, similar efforts have been made in South America to save Andean condors. Organizations there have set aside land for condors. Today, their numbers are rising, and it’s estimated that a few thousand birds live in the wild.
Can you imagine what it would be like to see such a gigantic bird fly overhead? It’s an amazing sight since a condor’s wingspan measures twice as wide as an eagle’s and five times as wide as a falcon’s! Many California condors live in protected reserves, which is one of the only places left where the huge birds fly. Serious dangers remain for condors. But if people continue to protect these giant, high-flying birds and their environments, they will keep us in awe for centuries to come.",930.0

Computer-Generated Images (CGI)
Computer-generated images can be used to create almost any imaginable effect in a movie—blazing fires, giant waves, or talking dinosaurs. Once the images are created on the computer, they can be changed, moved, copied, and combined with other images for the movie. Computers helped revolutionize the world of special effects in movies. With computers, special-effects artists can create movie scenes never thought possible. Now, computer-generated images can actually be used to create an entire movie like The Polar Express.
Audiences seventy-five years ago were awestruck by the special effects used in King Kong. And audiences of today are equally awestruck as they watch volcanoes erupt in cities, spaceships engage in dogfights, and huge ocean liners crack in half and sink to the bottom of the ocean. But today’s audiences know a little more about special effects than audiences of years ago. Does this mean that today’s audiences are bored with today’s movies? Not a chance! They still enjoy the “magic” they see on the screen. They love being frightened, amazed, and entertained. So, what’s left for movie special effects? Computer special-effects artists want to perfect a way to make a computer-generated human being look completely real. Will they achieve their goal? They probably will, because with special effects anything can happen, right?",1030.0
" Pollution from tourist and supply boats is increasing. In 2001, an oil tanker ran aground off one of the islands, causing a huge oil spill. Experts from around the world worked with the government of Ecuador, local scientists, and others in a massive cleanup effort.
To help preserve the Galapagos Islands, the government of Ecuador declared 95 percent of the land a national park in 1959. In 1986, a law was passed to protect 69,930 square kilometers (27,000 sq mi) of the ocean waters around the islands. Strict laws now limit visitation to the islands. Visitors must be accompanied by certified guides who are trained to keep conservation in mind at all times. Visitors are not allowed to bring food or drink in order to prevent the introduction of foreign plant seeds, insects, or bacteria. The laws also protect animals and plants from human interference, such as touching, feeding, or littering.
In 1959, the Charles Darwin Foundation was created to help the government of Ecuador make smart decisions about conservation on the islands. This foundation operates the Charles Darwin Research Station on Santa Cruz Island so that scientists and the public can continue to learn about these extraordinary islands. Many educational programs, both on the islands and around the world, help teach the public about Galapagos conservation efforts.
Our planet is now facing the mass extinction of up to 75 percent of all life forms. The Galapagos Islands are one of the last places on Earth that contain so many rare life forms in such a small area.

In addition to monuments, many stairways, water channels, and other features were also hand-carved into the natural shapes of the area’s cliffs and canyons.
Nabataean architecture is a mix of many different styles. It reflects the region’s cultural influences, including those of Mesopotamia, Greece, Rome, India, and Egypt.
Petra is Jordan’s most popular tourist attraction. Over four hundred thousand visitors made the trip in 2015. Travelers buy tickets at the Visitor Centre and enter through the Siq by horse cart, on foot, or on a horse, donkey, or camel. It’s possible to see Petra in two days, but several days are better.
Petra’s soft sandstone is vulnerable to wind and water erosion as well as damage from salt carried in on wind from the Red Sea. The city is also threatened by the high number of tourists. Touching, sitting, and walking on structures all cause their surfaces to wear down. In 1985, the Rose City became a UNESCO World Heritage Site, which ensures its protection and conservation.
Sun and Water Not much is known about the Nabataeans, but two things are certain. First, they worshipped the Sun. We know this because on the winter solstice and at certain other times of the year, the Sun shines on or lines up with 80 percent of Petra’s main structures.
Second, the Nabataeans were incredibly inventive in bringing water to the desert. More parts of their water-management system are being found all the time. Radar recently located a network of underground water channels. Scientists also found fountains and once-lush gardens.

" In spring and summer, some parts of the taiga are warm enough for these animals. They cope with the cold by hibernating in winter, either on land or, in the case of turtles and some frogs, at the bottom of lakes and ponds.
Wood frogs survive the taiga’s cold with the help of an unusual adaptation: their blood and body tissues freeze while they hibernate. In this frozen state, their breathing and heartbeat stop, blood ceases to flow, and ice crystals form under their skin. Special proteins and sugars protect their cells from damage. These frogs can tolerate more than half of their body freezing.
People have lived in the taiga for thousands of years. More than six hundred traditional communities live there today. Their livelihoods include reindeer herding, fishing, hunting, and crafts. Many of these people are working to preserve both the forests and their traditional way of life.
Because the taiga is forested, trees are a key natural resource, and logging is widespread. Mining, oil and gas exploration, and road construction are other industrial activities in this biome. People also travel to the taiga to enjoy boating, fishing, hiking, skiing, snowmobiling, dogsledding, and relaxing in cozy cabins.
Most of the taiga is fairly unpopulated. The two largest cities are Toronto, Canada, and Moscow, Russia.
The taiga stretches nearly 13 million square kilometers (about 5 million sq. mi.) across Earth’s northern lands. Conifers reign supreme in this cold region.
Siberia, in Russia, includes vast areas of taiga. Russian playwright Anton Chekhov traveled to the Siberian taiga on horseback in the late 1800s. He was so struck by the endless expanse of green conifers that he wondered if he’d ever get out. Although it’s certainly possible to leave the taiga, those fortunate enough to experience this land won’t soon forget it.",985.0
" To be contenders for medals, Olympic athletes must use the latest equipment and find the best trainers and sponsors. Athletes often begin their training at an early age. These athletes devote a great deal of personal time to improving their skills. Many countries maintain special Olympic training centers to support athletes during their training process.
Olympic competition is so strong that some athletes cheat. They think they need even more of an edge than nature and training can provide. In recent years, some Olympic athletes, often with the help of team trainers or doctors, have secretly used drugs to win. The use of banned substances by these athletes has damaged the image and reputation of the Olympics.
Since the mid-1970s, Olympic officials have routinely tested athletes for drug use. Olympic champions who fail a drug test can be stripped of their medals. For example, Marion Jones, the great American track star, had to return the five medals she had previously won in the 2000 Summer Olympics because she admitted to using steroids.
Controversies have also arisen concerning judges of figure-skating and diving competitions. Some judges may have awarded undeserved points to athletes from their own countries or agreed to trade points with other judges.
Olympic organizers work hard to keep the Games honest and fair for everyone. The Olympics continue to grow bigger and more popular each time they are held. Each Olympics includes the world’s best athletes, a new host country, and often some amazing surprises. Every two years, the Olympic Games offer new opportunities for athletes to become known as the best in the world. And few Olympics pass without world records being broken.

Once work had progressed far enough, specialists began to add decorations. Plasterers covered surfaces with white plaster. Scribes sketched hieroglyphs and figures, and a supervisor followed, making corrections. After corrections were made, artists would finalize the artwork, painting blocks of color and filling in the details.
Sometimes, workers carved away portions of a scene to make certain things stand out. Carving away the background left a kind of art, called a raised relief. Artists carved details into the raised figures before painting the finished scene.
The United Nations named the Valley of the Kings one of the first World Heritage sites in 1979. Over a million people visit the tombs each year. Eighteen tombs are open to the public on a rotating schedule. With the exception of Tutankhamen’s tomb, visitors can see any three of the open tombs with their entry ticket. Seeing Tutankhamen’s tomb requires buying an additional ticket. The treasures originally found in Tutankhamen’s tomb are now kept in the Cairo museum.
Unfortunately, the constant crowds have caused rapid temperature and humidity changes inside the tombs. Mold now grows on some of the tomb walls. People who accidentally touch the walls sometimes damage the ancient paint and carvings. The rotating schedule of open tombs gives the tombs occasional breaks from visitors and provides time for important repairs.
Today, the Valley of the Kings holds sixty-three known tombs, but more than one New Kingdom tomb remains undiscovered. The tombs of Ramses VIII and Thutmose II, as well as several queens and princes of the Eighteenth Dynasty, have yet to be discovered. These rulers were most likely buried somewhere in the Valley of the Kings.

When Miss Minchin sent her sister, Miss Amelia, to see what the child was doing, she found she could not open the door. “I have locked it,” said a queer, polite little voice from inside. “I want to be quite by myself, if you please.” Miss Amelia was fat and dumpy, and stood very much in awe of her sister. She was really the better-natured person of the two, but she never disobeyed Miss Minchin. She went downstairs again, looking almost alarmed. “I never saw such a funny, old-fashioned child, sister,” she said. “She has locked herself in, and she is not making the least particle of noise.” “It is much better than if she kicked and screamed, as some of them do,” Miss Minchin answered. “I expected that a child as much spoiled as she is would set the whole house in an uproar. If ever a child was given her own way in everything, she is.”

“You see,” said the woman, “I told her to come when she was hungry, and when she’d come I’d give her odd jobs to do; an’ I found she was willing, and somehow I got to like her; and the end of it was, I’ve given her a place an’ a home, and she helps me, an’ behaves well, an’ is as thankful as a girl can be.

" Although toucans are heard all the time, they are rarely seen because they mostly stay high up in the trees. Brightly colored frogs of the Amazon rainforest are lovely to look at, but they are among the most poisonous creatures on Earth. The poison of some species is so deadly that just touching them can kill. The poison in the skin of many of these frogs comes from toxic foods that they eat. In the Amazon River, red-bellied piranhas (pi-RAH-nuhz) hunt in groups of one hundred or more. These meat-eating fish have very sharp teeth and strong jaws. Although they eat animal flesh, they rarely attack humans. Instead, they usually eat dead animals.
The river is also home to a “shocking” snakelike fish called the electric eel. The electric eel can grow to be almost 2 meters (6 ft.) long and weigh as much as almost 22 kilograms (48 lbs.). They deliver a strong electric shock to stun prey and enemies. Other parts of Brazil, such as the Pantanal, also include fascinating animals. Storks and herons build nests in its swamps. Colorful parrots fly overhead. Giant anteaters, jaguars, and deer roam the land. Some animals in the Amazon Rainforest and the Pantanal could disappear from Earth forever because of habitat loss. As a result of deforestation, more than one fifth of the Amazon Rainforest has been destroyed and is gone forever. Many organizations are working together with the Brazilian government to save these areas.
Brazil is a colorful mix of different kinds of land, animals, and people. The Amazon River, the Amazon rainforest, and the Pantanal are all famous for hosting a variety of life. The diverse people, vibrant culture, and amazing celebrations make it a fascinating place unlike any other.",945.0
" If someone takes a long time to pay the money back, the interest gets bigger.
Debit and credit cards are made of durable plastic. The person’s name and an individual number are stamped onto one side, along with the name of the bank where the account is. A magnetic strip on the top has special encoded information about the person’s bank account. When the card is swiped through a card-reading machine, the machine electronically calls the bank to make sure that the account has enough money in it. If the money is there, the price is taken from the person’s account and moved to the store’s, restaurant’s, or company’s account. It is easier to carry around one piece of plastic than it is to carry many bills. Plus, since cards have your name and information on them, the money is harder to steal than bills are.
However, credit cards can be dangerous because people forget that they must pay back the money they borrowed. Many people who use credit cards irresponsibly owe so much money to the banks that the banks take back, or repossess, the things the person bought. Plastic cards are less visible than money, but they still buy the same goods. Our invisible money allows us to trade with people around the world. With the help of catalogs and the Internet, you can use a credit card to buy goods from a person or company in another country. Your money is automatically changed into a currency the other person can use.
Three thousand years ago, people bartered one good for another. Today, people trade with each other using bills, coins, and even invisible money. What sort of money do you think we’ll have in another three thousand years?",969.0
" It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us—that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they here gave the last full measure of devotion—that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain—that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom—and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.
Lincoln fills his audience with respect for the fallen soldiers, describing them as noble and honored. He uses that respect to inspire listeners to commit again to their nation, its freedoms, and the “great task ahead”—winning the war, ending slavery, and saving the United States of America. The speech ends with the most famous part: “that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.” Here, Lincoln again uses repetition, but with a difference. Rather than using synonyms again, Lincoln varies one phrase with simple prepositions to remind us what our government is all about: people.
Today, the handwritten copies of the Gettysburg Address are national treasures. The speech is also carved into the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. Yet the audience reaction to Lincoln’s speech that day was quiet.
Some say there was delayed, scattered applause, barely enough to be polite. Others describe the scene as hushed with “a dignified silence.” Some historians say there was no applause because the audience was so impressed. After all, in just ten sentences, Lincoln had summarized not only the war but also the spirit of a nation. We don’t know what the audience thought of his address that day. We only know that Americans have been inspired by it ever since.",1081.0
" We will bring the little girl with us, but if you should fall asleep you are too big to be carried.” So the Lion aroused himself and bounded forward as fast as he could go. In a moment he was out of sight. “Let us make a chair with our hands and carry her,” said the Scarecrow. So they picked up Toto and put the dog in Dorothy’s lap, and then they made a chair with their hands for the seat and their arms for the arms and carried the sleeping girl between them through the flowers.
On and on they walked, and it seemed that the great carpet of deadly flowers that surrounded them would never end. They followed the bend of the river, and at last came upon their friend the Lion, lying fast asleep among the poppies. The flowers had been too strong for the huge beast and he had given up at last, and fallen only a short distance from the end of the poppy bed, where the sweet grass spread in beautiful green fields before them. “We can do nothing for him,” said the Tin Woodman, sadly; “for he is much too heavy to lift. We must leave him here to sleep on forever, and perhaps he will dream that he has found courage at last.” “I’m sorry,” said the Scarecrow. “The Lion was a very good comrade for one so cowardly. But let us go on.” They carried the sleeping girl to a pretty spot beside the river, far enough from the poppy field to prevent her breathing any more of the poison of the flowers, and here they laid her gently on the soft grass and waited for the fresh breeze to waken her.",1022.0
" It gave the state authority to enforce stronger water-conservation measures if communities did not come up with their own plans. For instance, cities could fine people five hundred dollars a day if they violated restrictions on washing cars and watering lawns.Restrictions like these worked. From June 2014 until December 2014, per capita water use plummeted. On average, Californians went from using as much as 140 gallons (530 L) per person daily to just 67 gallons (254 L). Nationwide, 57 percent of American households rely on groundwater. In rural areas, that figure is more than 90 percent. Fortunately, small changes in plumbing and water-use habits can save hundreds of gallons in the average American home each week. By installing low-flush toilets and taking shorter showers, we can contribute to groundwater conservation. Another small effort that can save gallons is running only full loads in washing machines and dishwashers.
In addition, property owners can save large volumes of water by replacing thirsty grass lawns with landscaping that needs less watering. The motto in California for letting lawns die is pretty catchy: “Brown is the New Green.” There is no quick, easy fix for preserving groundwater. People need to drink. Farmers need to irrigate crops to grow our food. Still, we can be smarter about how we use this resource, both now and far into the future. Did you know that toilets use more water than anything else in your house? They do, according to a 2016 study of water use inside 23,749 homes spread throughout the United States—but not as much as they did in a similar 1999 study. Newer, more efficient toilets help send less water into the sewer. Some families also practice selective flushing. That means they don’t flush the toilet each time they use it.",1026.0
" In this version of events, it may have been the king’s chief minister who drafted the warning letter to Lord Monteagle. How could the plotters have carried out their work right under the noses of the king’s guards? Were the plotters used as scapegoats to raise support for an unpopular king? There is no clear proof for this theory, but the discovery of the Gunpowder Plot brought the public relief that the king’s life had been saved. The king announced that his survival was a miracle and proof of his divine right to the throne. Parliament passed a law that same year to make November 5 an official annual day of celebration. The festivities were intended to strengthen loyalty to the king.
The holiday was first known as Gunpowder Treason Day. Records from this time show that people rang church bells and lit bonfires. In England, burning dummies of unpopular figures on bonfires was already a popular activity. People believed that doing this would drive away evil spirits. On November 5, people began to burn a dummy of Guy Fawkes on top of the bonfire. By the late nineteenth century, spectacular firework displays and torch-lit processions in towns and cities had become very popular. The processions led to where the bonfire and firework displays were held. Today, the bonfires are usually organized by local charities or municipal organizations.
Guy Fawkes Day celebrates the failure of the Gunpowder Plot to kill the king of England over four hundred years ago. Today, millions of people in the United Kingdom continue to enjoy bonfires and special firework displays on November 5. Guy Fawkes Day has become a time to celebrate and have fun with friends and family.",1033.0

Brain changes usually occur only in regions directly involved with your activity. However, research suggests that some “mental training” may cause broader changes. For instance, research at Harvard Medical School showed that people who practiced meditation for eight weeks had changes in brain regions used for learning, memory, and emotional control. Physical exercise—especially exercise that raises your heart rate—also has brainwide benefits. Dr. Arthur Kramer is the director of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology at the University of Illinois, where he studies how exercise affects the brain. “Exercising is good for your body and your brain,” Kramer says. “Research has shown that children who regularly exercise have better memories and attention and often do better on school tests.” Sleep is another key to healthy brain function. According to Dr. Ken Paller, director of the Cognitive Neuroscience Program at Northwestern University, evidence suggests that your brain replays memories during sleep. That may help skills and information “stick” in your memory. However it works, it’s clear that getting too little sleep decreases your ability to learn and think.
Brain protection is the most important key to brain health. Shock-absorbing fluid and a hard skull guard your brain against injury. If you land on concrete, though, a fall from only two or three feet can crack your skull or bruise your brain. Swelling or bleeding inside the skull quickly cuts off the brain’s blood supply—and your brain can survive only a few minutes without oxygen. Wearing a helmet during sports provides extra protection that may save your brain—and your Your brain may be the most important part of your body.

" Today, it is known as the Great Wall, even though it is actually a series of walls throughout northern China and Southern Mongolia. One section of the Great Wall runs about 8,850 kilometers (5,500 mi.) and ranges from 5 to 8 meters (15–25 ft.) wide.
The ancient Chinese made great advances and invented many things. One invention, the abacus, was an early way of doing complex mathematical calculations. The ancient Chinese invented the magnetic compass, which helped early sailors navigate. They also invented gunpowder to blast rocks apart and to make fireworks. The ancient Chinese were also the first to make fabric from silk. It became the country’s most popular export, and people traveled from around the world on a trade route called the Silk Road to get it. The fibers used to make silk come from the cocoons of silkworms. The ancient Chinese discovered that they could separate the fibers from the cocoon and then spin the fibers together to make a strong thread. The thread was woven together to make beautiful cloth. In 1912, China went through massive changes. War with Japan and internal strife ended the Qing Dynasty, and China became a republic. After many years of political turmoil and conflict, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) took control of the government in 1949.

"4 m). It slithers through the grass looking for rodents, birds, and eggs to eat. It also hisses loudly! Other prairie snakes include the prairie kingsnake, the massasauga (also called the timber rattlesnake), and the fox snake.
Prairie dogs live in western prairies, but they are not dogs. They are rodents that bark like dogs! Prairie dogs live in groups of hundreds of animals called towns. They dig large systems of underground burrows where they run to hide when hawks, coyotes, or other enemies come near. These burrows can be 16 feet (5 m) deep.
Several kinds of hawks fly over prairies during the day searching for rodents, songbirds, and other prey. (Their role as flying hunters is taken over at night by owls.) The northern harrier (also called the marsh hawk) stands about 2 feet (61 cm) tall. It glides low over the ground as it hunts, calling “kee kee kee.” The northern harrier can fly as fast as 40 miles (64 km) per hour.
Coyotes, sometimes called prairie wolves, are about as large as a medium-sized dog. They usually weigh between 20 and 50 pounds (9–23 kg). Coyotes eat rodents, rabbits, dead animals, and fruit. They make spooky-sounding howls that can be heard at night. Foxes are smaller than coyotes. They usually weigh between 8 and 15 pounds (4–7 kg). Like coyotes, foxes will eat just about anything they can catch. Both gray and red foxes can be found on prairies.

" Hawass announced that the skull damage happened after Tut was dead. He determined that it probably occurred during the mummification process.
The CT scans also revealed that the young king had several physical problems, including a cleft palate and a club foot. The researchers also found other evidence of what might have killed Tut. The scans showed that shortly before his death, he had suffered a broken leg that hadn’t healed properly. Hawass said the king may have developed an infection from the injury and died a few days later. From 2007 to 2010, Hawass and other researchers studied Tut’s remains using genetic tests. The new genetic tests showed the researchers two important conditions they hadn’t seen before. There was evidence that King Tut had multiple attacks of severe malaria. The disease alone probably wouldn’t have killed Tut, but it may have left him very weak. They also found evidence of a deterioration of the bones in his left foot. Tut may have inherited the condition from both of his parents; since they were siblings, it may have made the damaging effects of the condition worse.
Mystery Solved?
Did young King Tut die from a combination of physical problems, an accident, a disease, and/or an infection from a broken leg? Or could it have been something else? Some members of Hawass’s group said the broken leg might have happened when Tut was being embalmed. Other experts say that Carter’s team caused the break when they removed Tut’s mummy from its inner coffin years ago. With new scientific research and DNA evidence, theories of how the young king lived and died become more provable. But different experts might interpret them differently.

" Peasants now had more bargaining power, however. Some moved from their home villages to where they were offered better opportunities.
The aftermath of the Black Death had a big impact on survivors’ views about society and the meaning of life as well. Many questioned their belief in religion and the church. Some challenged their leaders, lords, and kings. The authority of powerful individuals had proven useless in protecting the people they controlled and ruled. There were many examples of important progress in post-plague Europe. Agriculture improved as farmers experimented with better practices and equipment to grow more food with fewer hands. Public health and medicine also saw positive changes as more communities recognized the importance of sanitation and put in place better ways to limit and treat disease outbreaks.
Modern science and medical care have made another outbreak of the Black Death all but impossible. Plague bacteria are still out there living in the fleas of some rodent colonies. However, antibiotics—medicines designed to kill harmful microbes in the body—can quickly stop most cases. Modern sanitation and public health programs also help control the spread of most forms of disease.
In the mid-1300s, the mystery and horror of the Black Death terrorized many Europeans into believing the end of the world was upon them. In terms of death rates, it remains the most destructive event in European history. At the same time, some historians link the ruin it caused with the Renaissance period, which soon followed. Lasting from the late 1300s until the 1600s, the Renaissance was a huge cultural shift in Europe. It inspired great advancements in medicine, science, art, and philosophy. Renaissance means “rebirth” in French, and after the horror of the Black Death, a period of rebirth was precisely what Europe needed.",1072.0

Some opponents complain that its operations cost too much. Others point to the Security Council’s failures to prevent war and the mass murder of civilians. Another complaint is that the UN plays favorites, overriding the best interests of some countries in favor of others. At the same time, the organization has done a lot of good in its more than seventy years. It provides food to over ninety million people worldwide who might otherwise starve. It vaccinates more than half the world’s children, helping prevent international epidemics. It allows leaders to talk through their differences rather than fight about them on the battlefield.

And if ever you catch me going a-pleasuring with this provoking animal again!” He snorted, and during the rest of that weary trudge addressed his remarks exclusively to Mole.
On reaching the town they went straight to the station and deposited Toad in the second-class waiting room, giving a porter twopence to keep a strict eye on him.

" The unconscious Lincoln was taken across the street to a private house. He died early the next morning. Booth was an actor and Southern sympathizer. He was also part of a group of conspirators who sought revenge for the defeat of the Confederacy.
They planned to kill not only Lincoln but also Vice President Andrew Johnson and Secretary of State William Seward. As it turned out, only Lincoln was assassinated, though Seward received serious knife wounds. Union troops tracked Booth and a fellow conspirator, David Herold, to a farm in Virginia. Booth was shot to death, and Herold was taken prisoner. Herold and other conspirators were later tried for their crimes. Four of them, including Herold, were found guilty and hanged. Lincoln’s body was transported by a funeral train back to his home state of Illinois. He was buried in Springfield, the city where he had practiced law before entering politics. Although Lincoln was gone, he lived long enough to achieve his main goals: the preservation of the Union and an end to slavery.
The end of the Civil War also began the next chapter in the history of the United States. By December 6, 1865, the Thirteenth Amendment had been ratified by enough states to become law. Two additional amendments—the Fourteenth and Fifteenth—giving former slaves civil rights and voting rights, were passed within the next five years.
Beyond freeing the slaves, the Civil War established the principle that the United States is an indivisible nation. States, whatever their grievances, do not have the right to secede from the Union. In the years since the Civil War, the nation has seen other times of great strife and strain. Americans continue to be divided today on many issues, in many ways.

" They also estimate that each week that the polar bear loses in its hunting season results in a loss of 10 kilograms (22 lbs) of body fat for the summer.
Due to their lower body weight, female polar bears are giving birth to fewer cubs. This is a grave problem for the survival of an animal that has an average of only two cubs every 28 months. Polar bears in search of food are also venturing into areas inhabited by humans during the summer. In some places, these bears are captured and put into bear compounds until the winter ice returns. They are then released so they can hunt and restore their body fat.
Global warming isn’t the only bad effect of human activity on polar bears. Many pollutants reaching the air and water are toxic. These pollutants often end up in the blubber of seals. When bears eat these seals, they ingest. the toxins.
Another threat to polar bears comes from the desire of humans to use more and more fuel. To meet this human need, oil and gas companies are planning to drill in Arctic regions where polar bears live. Much of this drilling would occur where female polar bears build dens in which they give birth to their cubs. This exploration and drilling could have serious consequences for the polar bears’ ability to survive.
There is no question that the world’s polar bear population is shrinking. In the Western Hudson Bay region of Northern Canada alone, the population has dropped from over 1,200 in 1995 to fewer than 900 bears in 2010.

" Albinism is caused by genes that reduce the amount of melanin formed in the body. The condition often results in very pale skin and white or pale blond hair. People with albinism must make an extra effort to stay safe from UV radiation. Staying out of the sun, wearing protective clothing, and using sunscreen are all important. Albinism can also affect both the color and health of the eyes. Blue eyes are most common, but they may be reddish, purple, hazel, or brown. People with albinism often have vision problems that cannot be corrected with glasses. Many are unable to drive.
Vitiligo (vit-ih-LY-go) causes the skin to lose color in patches. It can affect many or just a few parts of the body. The direct cause of vitiligo is melanocytes dying or not working properly. However, no one knows why that happens. Vitiligo is not dangerous, but it can cause a person to feel self-conscious. It’s important for people with vitiligo to use sunscreen, too, since skin that has lost color can sunburn easily. Another concern for people with vitiligo is partial hearing loss if the melanocytes in the inner ear are affected.
As a result of thousands of years of human migration, many people no longer live in areas that their skin color is best suited for. People with darker skin who live in low-UV areas nearer the poles must be careful to get enough vitamin D. People with lighter skin who live in high-UV areas nearer the equator must protect their skin from too much UV-B radiation. Fortunately, people are problem solvers. Sunscreen, sun-protective clothing, and vitamin D supplements address the problems caused by UV mismatches.

Imagine a city carved from solid rock. Petra, an ancient city in the Middle Eastern nation of Jordan, was carved out of pink and gray sandstone cliffs about 2,000 years ago. The word petra means rock. An ancient Arab tribe shaped solid cliffs and narrow canyons into over 500 temples, houses, stores, a theater, and tombs. Ancient Petra stood at a place where two main trade routes met. Tired traders and their camel caravans would stop at the city to rest and get food and water. Over many years, trade routes moved to other areas. The rock city hidden in the canyons was forgotten. It was finally rediscovered by a Swiss explorer, Johann Burckhardt, in 1812.
To enter Petra, visitors must walk, ride a horse, or ride in a horse-drawn cart through a long, narrow canyon entrance called the Siq. At the end of the Siq entrance stands the most famous building in Petra, the Treasury. It is just the first of many fantastic sights of Petra, a city carved from stone.

" But it was still difficult. Another English scientist, Isaac Newton, made it easier to predict eclipses. Newton discovered how objects in the solar system move. He developed a very detailed theory of gravity. Halley used Newton’s findings to calculate future eclipses. By using computers programmed with Newton’s laws of gravity, scientists can now predict eclipses far into the future.
Once you’ve figured out where you need to be to see a solar eclipse, your work is not quite done. You need to take some steps to make sure you can watch the eclipse safely because looking directly at the Sun can damage your eyes. Normally, the Sun is too bright to look at for very long, and pain makes you look away. But during an eclipse, the brightness dims, and it’s possible to look at the Sun without feeling any pain, even while severely damaging your eyes. For this reason, you should NEVER look directly at the Sun during an eclipse or at any other time.
It also is possible to view a solar eclipse safely using special light filters, such as inexpensive eclipse-viewing safety glasses. Even when using these special glasses, you shouldn’t look at the Sun for very long. Look for a few seconds and then turn away for a few seconds. Be sure to use these glasses only in the company of an adult. You can’t be too careful when looking at the Sun.
Eclipses are impressive cosmic events that still inspire awe in people of all ages around the world. Thanks to science, we now understand the causes of eclipses and can predict them with amazing accuracy. But eclipses will probably always feel a little mysterious and magical to those who watch them, just as they did to people thousands of years ago.",1044.0
" Modern construction covers up or destroys many of the natural systems for handling floods. With nothing to absorb or stop the water, it flows on top of the ground, causing much more damage. As a result, people have created multiple lines of defense from floods. The most obvious are the gutters, drains, and sewers that take water from the streets and quickly move it away. This urban drainage system is effective most of the time. However, it causes some problems. The increased amount of water draining into rivers and streams can actually cause flooding in other areas.
Urban drainage can only handle so much water. People have created other systems to protect themselves from floods. They have built levees, dikes, and dams to hold back large amounts of water. Many dams have gates that allow people to control the flow of water through the dam. These structures help, but they can also cause problems. The blocked water builds up behind them, causing a change in the surrounding ecosystem. They also disrupt flood patterns and ecosystems downstream. Some systems for protecting people from floods are massive in scale. For hundreds of years, the people of the Netherlands suffered constant flooding. In 1927, they began building the North Sea Protection Works. This complex system of structures took almost twenty-five years to build.
Although we have created many ways to warn and protect ourselves, floods still occur. Every year, floods cause billions of dollars in property damage and take thousands of people’s lives. However, they are necessary to the health of many different animals, including people. As we learn more about floods, we may be able to discover a balance between our needs and the destructive and helpful properties of this natural process.",993.0
" They say it may have been caught in a fierce storm that took place on March 10, which could have capsized the ship.
SS Edmund Fitzgerald left Superior, Wisconsin, on November 9, 1975, loaded with iron ore. A storm was forecast, but the ship’s captain was not worried. On the afternoon of November 10, the U.S. Coast Guard warned all ships to seek shelter. The Edmund Fitzgerald headed for Whitefish Bay, Wisconsin. At about 7:00 p.m., the captain reported the ship was taking on water but stated over the radio, “We are holding our own.”
Minutes later, the ship was gone. It no longer appeared on radar. No lifeboats were launched. None of the twenty-nine crew members were found. Days later, the wreck was located on the lake floor. The ship had been snapped in half. Investigators suspect a series of three rogue waves may have sunk the ship so quickly there was no time even to make a distress call.
Sailing the seas is a great adventure. Part of any true adventure, though, is the element of danger—and the sea has plenty of it. The oceans stretch vast distances, weather can turn suddenly savage, and dangerous reefs and rocks hide along coastlines. Modern equipment makes shipping safer than ever, but dozens of shipwrecks still claim the lives of about two thousand people every year. Working on a ship remains one of the world’s most dangerous jobs. Sailors entrust their lives to their knowledge, skills, and the ships they serve on, but sometimes, they are left to depend on only their luck. Every shipwreck leaves behind mysteries. Some of these mysteries can be explored and eventually explained. Much of the time, though, the sea’s secrets are never brought to light.",895.0
" The other two are 8 hours long and are made at specific checkpoints. Mushers who mistreat their dogs are disqualified.
The dogs eat a lot during the race to keep their energy high. One dog can consume up to 10,000 calories per day. The dogs’ diets are rich in fat and protein from meat, pure fat, and dry dog food. They also need a lot of water, which the mushers warm up so that the dogs will not lose heat. The dogs typically eat three meals a day during rests, and they also get lots of snacks on the trail. Like any athletic team, the dogs go through rigid training before the race. Sled dogs are trained to pull from the time they are puppies. Between September and February before the Iditarod, teams make practice runs of up to 2,253 kilometers (1,400 mi). They also compete in smaller races of 322 kilometers (200 mi) or more. In the end, the best-trained team is usually the winner.
The Iditarod, also known as the “Last Great Race,” is a grueling competition between sled-dog teams. They race across the Alaskan wilderness for 10 to 12 days for a more than $50,000 prize. Mushers come from around the world to compete. Journalists, TV networks, and newspaper reporters from across the globe come to cover the race. But it is not the money or the fame that attracts the mushers. The mushers do not really race their teams against one another; they race against the hardships of the wilderness and against themselves. Any musher will tell you that the true heroes of the Iditarod are the huskies who run almost 2,000 kilometers (1,243 mi) over some of the harshest, most beautiful land on Earth.",898.0
" In radar, a special instrument sends out radio waves, which are then reflected off a surface. The time it takes for the waves to bounce back gives scientists information about the surface. Another Pioneer flew by Venus, studying its atmosphere with scientific instruments. Scientists learned the most about Venus in the 1990s, when the U.S. Magellan probe orbited the planet. Magellan used an advanced type of radar to produce many pictures of the surface of Venus. For the first time, scientists could see the mountains, volcanoes, and other features of the surface in sharp detail. The European Union launched the Venus Express probe in 2005. Scientists used instruments on Venus Express to further study the planet’s clouds and surface. Japan launched the Akatsuki orbiter in 2010 to study the planet’s lightning and volcanoes.
Venus caught the eyes of stargazers thousands of years ago. Outshining everything else in the sky—except for the Sun and Moon—it seemed to demand a special place of honor. Venus received this honor by being named after an ancient mythological goddess of love and beauty. We honor Venus today by studying it with science, which has shed much light on this bright point in the heavens. Thanks to science, we know that Venus is a very special and strange kind of world. It is the hottest planet in the Solar System. It has some of the largest mountains and volcanoes found on any planet. It “rains” sulfuric acid. People once thought that Venus was like Earth. We now know that Venus is as unlike Earth as another planet can possibly be. It’s a very hostile world where life as we know it is impossible. Yet, Venus undoubtedly possesses a strange beauty of its own. Both beauty and beast—that’s Venus!",942.0
"7 m)—with an engine less powerful than most riding lawn mowers.
From the beginning of flight, you walk a short distance to the Milestones of Flight Hall. Mom points out the Spirit of St. Louis, the plane Charles Lindbergh flew on the first nonstop solo flight across the Atlantic Ocean in 1927. Then you see the actual Apollo 11 command module, which carried astronauts to the Moon in 1969. Nearby, you touch an actual Moon rock. It’s smooth and cool.
Next is Amelia Earhart’s bright red airplane. Mom explains that, in this airplane, Earhart became the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean—five years to the day after Charles Lindbergh’s famous trip. In another area sits a real airplane engine you can explore—and you even get to use some airplane mechanic tools. You’re just beginning to look into the engine when your dad calls. It’s time to go.

" Sara always said something queer, and never seemed the least bit frightened. She was not in the least frightened now, though her boxed ears were scarlet and her eyes were as bright as stars. “I was thinking,” she answered grandly and politely, “that you did not know what you were doing.” “That I did not know what I was doing?” Miss Minchin fairly gasped. “Yes,” said Sara, “and I was thinking what would happen if I were a princess and you boxed my ears—what I should do to you. And I was thinking that if I were one, you would never dare to do it, whatever I said or did. And I was thinking how surprised and frightened you would be if you suddenly found out—” She had the imagined future so clearly before her eyes that she spoke in a manner which had an effect even upon Miss Minchin. It almost seemed for the moment to her narrow, unimaginative mind that there must be some real power hidden behind this candid daring.
“What?” she exclaimed. “Found out what?” “That I really was a princess,” said Sara, “and could do anything—anything I liked.” Every pair of eyes in the room widened to its full limit. Lavinia leaned forward on her seat to look. “Go to your room,” cried Miss Minchin, breathlessly, “this instant! Leave the schoolroom! Attend to your lessons, young ladies!” Sara made a little bow. “Excuse me for laughing if it was impolite,” she said, and walked out of the room, leaving Miss Minchin struggling with her rage, and the girls whispering over their books. “Did you see her? Did you see how queer she looked?” Jessie broke out. “I shouldn’t be at all surprised if she did turn out to be something. Suppose she should!”",692.0

Sara nodded. “You haven’t time to hear it now, I’m afraid,” she said, “but if you will tell me just what time you come to do my rooms, I will try to be here and tell you a bit of it every day until it is finished. It’s a lovely long one—and I’m always putting new bits to it.” “Then,” breathed Becky, devoutly, “I wouldn’t mind how heavy the coal boxes was—or what the cook done to me, if—if I might have that to think of.” “You may,” said Sara. “I’ll tell it all to you.” When Becky went downstairs, she was not the same Becky who had staggered up, loaded down by the weight of the coal scuttle. She had an extra piece of cake in her pocket, and she had been fed and warmed, but not only by cake and fire. Something else had warmed and fed her, and the something else was Sara. When she was gone Sara sat on her favorite perch on the end of her table. Her feet were on a chair, her elbows on her knees, and her chin in her hands.

" Burmese pythons live at the top of the Everglades food chain. Alligators will eat them if they can, but once a python gets big enough, it will even attack alligators.
Finding pythons in the Everglades is tough. The landscape makes it easy for pythons to hide—and hard for humans to find them. Burmese pythons may hide in the grass and brush, and they can stay underwater for up to thirty minutes. Still, Florida workers and volunteers are taking action to try to bring pythons under control. At Everglades National Park, they track down and capture the snakes when possible—almost 2,000 in recent years. Hunters are also allowed to capture the snakes or kill them for their skins and meat. Unfortunately, hunters sometimes mistakenly kill small native snakes, thinking they are baby pythons. One way researchers track pythons is by using radio transmitters. They insert the device into a live snake and release it, and that snake might lead them to other pythons.
New laws have been put in place to prevent pet pythons from joining those in the wild. Still, most experts believe it is already too late to stop the python takeover of Florida. Wildlife biologists today fear that Burmese pythons may invade other parts of the country. They can swim to new territory and survive in most places where winters don’t get too cold. Many southern states could be at risk, from South Carolina all the way to California. Scientists continue to investigate the role that pythons play in the changing Everglades ecosystem. Until they learn more, they are careful about putting all the blame on pythons. Still, what we learn about these snake invaders in Florida may keep them from making their way across the country.",1028.0
" His decision to turn away signaled the end of the Third Crusade. On September 2, 1192, Saladin’s brother discussed the terms of a truce with Richard. Saladin allowed the Franks to keep the coast between Tyre and Jaffa. The rest of the land, including Jerusalem, would be Muslim land, but Christians would be allowed to visit holy places. Saladin’s honorable conduct won him lasting respect and appreciation from the Christian world.
Saladin went home to Damascus after the truce was signed. He died only six months later, on March 4, 1193, at age fifty-five. Because he never cared much for money or a life of luxury, he gave everything away, so there was no money for a proper burial. He was later buried in a building constructed by his son in Damascus. After Saladin’s death, his family continued to rule over Egypt and nearby lands until 1250. At that point, another group gained power. Jerusalem remained mostly under Muslim rule for centuries.
When Saladin was alive, he was respected for his intelligence as well as his political and military skills. Muslims respected him for uniting them and for driving the Crusaders out of Jerusalem. Even though the Crusaders were his enemies, they too had high respect for Saladin. He was known across two continents as a leader who, while fierce in battle, also showed mercy. The time in history when Saladin lived—the Middle Ages—was known for great violence. Still, one of its most respected leaders is remembered for just the opposite. Just before Saladin died, he told his oldest son, “I have become as great as I am because I have won men’s hearts by gentleness and kindness.” Saladin set an example of an honorable leader during his lifetime, and he continues to set an example today.",981.0
" Scientists have turned to green plants for a better way to convert sunlight to energy. Green plants use chlorophyll to absorb light, which they then turn into food. A new type of solar cell uses natural dyes that mimic how chlorophyll works. These new cells may perform just as well as the old cells, without the cost and waste.
Freezing temperatures can be hard on machines and living things. Chemical antifreeze keeps engines and machines running in cold weather. Some kinds of ice fish use natural antifreeze to survive chilly temperatures in Antarctic waters. Unlike chemical antifreeze, fish antifreeze does not harm living tissue. Scientists are trying to learn more about how the fish make and use natural antifreeze. This information can help researchers create a safe way to keep living tissue warm and healthy.
Spiderwebs are made of sticky silk that is also quite strong. A thread of spider silk is about three times as strong as a steel thread of the same size. Scientists have analyzed spider silk so that they can create a similar material. The human-made silk could be used to create all sorts of durable materials, from bandages to fences.
Animals that live in the wild sometimes get ill, just as people do. Unlike humans, they can’t go to a doctor or clinic. Instead, they have found ways to treat themselves, either by eating certain plants or applying minerals. Observing animal behavior might provide people with clues about treatments for human sicknesses.
Nature provides important lessons for humans, but there is still much to be learned. By studying the living things around us, scientists can find inspiration for solutions to important problems. The best answers may be right under our noses, waiting to be discovered through the science of biomimicry.",948.0
" Yet the abolition of slavery wasn’t a stated goal of the war, though Douglass repeatedly urged Lincoln to make it one. Some historians think Douglass helped inspire the renowned Gettysburg Address and a Lincoln inaugural address. Douglass also convinced Lincoln to allow black soldiers to fight for the North. The Union Army’s 54th Massachusetts Regiment was the first to be comprised of black soldiers, including two of Douglass’s sons. Douglass’s writing and speaking helped end slavery with the Thirteenth Amendment, passed after the Civil War ended in 1865. Three years later, the Fourteenth Amendment granted citizenship to former slaves, and shortly after that, in 1870, the Fifteenth Amendment granted every male citizen, including former slaves, the right to vote. For the rest of his life, Douglass continued to promote equality for all Americans. He wanted the United States to reach its potential as a “land of the free” for blacks, women, Native Americans, and immigrants, too. “I would unite with anybody to do right and with nobody to do wrong,” Douglass said.
Douglass remained married to Anna for forty- four years, until she passed away in 1882. Two years later he married Helen Pitts, an advocate for civil rights. Their marriage caused controversy since Pitts was a white woman, but Douglass sought to live in a world where race didn’t matter. He died on February 20, 1895. Today, Douglass is often referred to as the father of the civil rights movement. Seventy years after his death, at the height of that movement, the United States Postal Service honored him with his own 1965 postage stamp. He changed the way the country thought about slavery and race, and left behind words to continue to inspire Americans, including his newspaper’s motto: “Right is of no sex, truth is of no color.”",1190.0
" Salk didn’t panic; he knew that the vaccine, if properly prepared, was safe. Investigators soon tracked the problem to one manufacturer that had not properly killed the virus. That vaccine was pulled, and the vaccinations continued. By 1962, the number of polio cases in the United States dropped to fewer than one thousand. Salk’s vaccine worked, but it was expensive to produce. That year the United States approved Sabin’s live-virus vaccine. It was cheaper than the killed-virus vaccine. Plus, it was given on a sugar cube instead of in a series of shots. By 1979, most of the few remaining cases of polio were traced to the live-virus vaccine. After 2000, the United States decided to use only the killed-virus vaccine. Salk had developed the first polio vaccine, and his vaccine finally eliminated the disease in the United States.
Salk went on to tackle new challenges. In 1960, he founded the Salk Institute as a place for scientists to work for the good of humanity. He researched diseases such as cancer and HIV/AIDS until his death in 1995. Today, the Salk Institute does cutting-edge medical research and has produced several Nobel Prize winners. Salk did not receive a Nobel Prize. At the time, many scientists agreed with Sabin when he said that Salk’s work was “pure kitchen chemistry. He didn’t discover anything.” Salk was the only major polio researcher never elected to the National Academy of Sciences. Salk received thanks from his country and the world for saving thousands of children from the crippling disease. Time magazine named him one of the hundred most important people of the twentieth century. He brought together discoveries from decades of polio research. He also used new ideas to develop the first polio vaccine. Salk achieved his goal of making a difference for humanity.",947.0

Other places in Kenya have many animals, too. Thousands, sometimes millions, of greater and lesser flamingos gather on Lake Nakuru in the Great Rift Valley. These wading birds stick their heads into the water to feed on small plants and animals. Flamingos spend most of their time in the water, but another African bird lives only on land. The ostrich is the largest bird in the world, and it lays the largest eggs as well. One egg can weigh 1.35 kilograms (3 lbs.). To protect itself from predators, an ostrich may hide by stretching out on the ground. It may also run away, reaching speeds of up to 70 kilometers (43 mi.) per hour. If all else fails, the ostrich can deliver powerful kicks to defend itself. Kenya has several large, dangerous predators, and two that are most harmful to humans are actually very small. The tsetse (TSEE-tsee) fly and the mosquito infest about one-third of the country. These insects carry the diseases of malaria and sleeping sickness. Sleeping sickness gets its name from one of its symptoms: people with the disease become very sleepy. When a tsetse fly or mosquito bites a person, the insect transmits a very small organism that causes disease. Both malaria and sleeping sickness make people very ill.
Kenya may be famous for its safaris and savanna, yet the country has much more to offer. The cliffs of the Great Rift tower over a valley filled with life, and many of its animal species cannot be found anywhere else. Kenya’s capital city is the center of industry for the whole country, exporting goods to places all over the world. Kenya is one of the world’s most spectacular nations, filled with an abundance of natural beauty and a multitude of fascinating cultures.",986.0
" El Castillo, or the Castle, is 24 meters (79 ft.) tall, and each of its four sides contains ninety-one steps. Added together, the number of steps totals 364—the number of days Earth takes to orbit the Sun. By the time the Spanish arrived in Mexico, the Maya had left Chichén Itzá. The jungle covered it for the next three hundred years. In the 1800s, people found the city and began to study it.
The Mayan ruins at Palenque (pah-LEN-keh) overlook the surrounding jungle from a mountain forest that provides a home for wildlife such as toucans and monkeys. Palenque contains remarkable architecture, sculpture, wall carvings, tombs of ancient rulers, and even a water system. Writings and symbols carved on tombs and buildings helped scientists understand the history of the city. The ruins of Teotihuacan (tay-oh-tee-wah- KAHN) are located near Mexico City. Scientists are not sure where the people of Teotihuacan lived before they built the city. However, scientists do know that it was one of the largest in the world at the time it was built. Teotihuacan has two main pyramids. The larger is the Pyramid of the Sun; the smaller is the Pyramid of the Moon. The city also includes great temples, palaces, and even apartment complexes. From studying the site, scientists know that like the Aztec and Maya, the people who built Teotihuacan sacrificed people to their gods.
From its native civilizations, to the Spanish conquest, to revolution and democracy, Mexico is a country with a rich history. Its artistic traditions and ancient ruins tell the long and fascinating story. The country is also one of geographic contrasts.

" A Spanish breakfast might have coffee, milk, or hot chocolate, a sweet roll, and sometimes cereal. They eat lunch—the biggest meal of the day—around two in the afternoon. Lunch may include soup, salad, a main course, and dessert. Dinner is a lighter meal and is served late, anywhere from nine to eleven in the evening. Each region in Spain enjoys its own style of food. Coastal regions typically serve seafood. People in central Spain often eat beans, lentils, lamb, and pork. Valencia, known for its rice dishes, is famous for paella—a rice dish that can be made with fish, meat, and vegetables. A delicious and popular soup called gazpacho comes from the Andalusian region of Spain. Made with tomatoes and other vegetables, the soup is often served cold in the summer as a refreshing meal. Tapas are finger foods that can be eaten cold or hot and are usually served on small plates. People serve shrimp and squid along the Spanish coasts, while people serve sausages inland.
The Spanish are a very proud people. Although many identify with the town or region they’re from, their celebrations and festivals bring them together as a nation. Some regions still try to preserve their own traditions, but the country has been unified for many years. Spain is one of the most lively cultural centers in the European Union. It boasts an amazing heritage due in part to the arrival of people from many different parts of the world who have brought celebrations, food, and architecture to Spanish culture. Although the Spanish treasure their rich and remarkable history, they are also a people who enjoy living in the present. Spain’s beauty, its long cultural heritage, and the warmth of its people help to make our world a more interesting place to live in.",987.0
" Dead whales have washed ashore with their guts stuffed with plastic bags they have mistakenly swallowed, thinking they were jellyfish or other food. Many seabirds are dying after swallowing plastic bits, and researchers are finding microplastics in fish, oysters, and other seafood we eat. As the plastic piles up, more people are taking action to help solve these problems. Communities are banning disposable plastic bags in their stores. Some countries are experimenting with charging customers a small deposit on each plastic drink bottle; they then get that money back when the container is returned. Norway’s “Deposit Return Scheme” has resulted in 96 percent of that country’s plastic bottles being recycled instead of becoming garbage. In some cases, kids are leading the way in tackling plastic pollution. Milo Cress was nine years old when he started the Be Straw Free campaign in 2011. He urged restaurants and their customers to stop using plastic straws. The organization estimates that Americans use half a billion straws every day, and straws are among the most common forms of plastic trash. Still, plastic pollution remains a big problem in search of an answer.
Plastic is here to stay for many, many reasons. Plastic products make our daily lives easier, more affordable, and more convenient. Chemical engineers and inventors used their creative genius and worked hard to create a material that has so many good uses. Now, similar minds need to embrace the challenge of creating new forms of plastic that do less harm to the environment. In the meantime, we all can take action to be more mindful of our plastic habits. We need no special talents or knowledge to reduce our use of plastic, reuse it when possible, and recycle it at every opportunity—while still enjoying its benefits.",1144.0
" In 1920, Stubby was an honored guest at the Republican National Convention, at which Warren G. Harding was nominated for president. After winning the presidency, Harding invited Stubby to the White House. Stubby also paid visits to Harding’s successor, Calvin Coolidge.
Many establishments with no-pet rules made exceptions for Stubby. The New York Times reported that the city’s exclusive Hotel Majestic had allowed Stubby to stay overnight with Conroy. Perhaps the greatest tribute paid to Stubby took place on July 6, 1921, in Washington, D.C. The occasion was a ceremony honoring members of the 102nd Infantry Regiment. Presiding over the proceedings was General John J. “Black Jack” Pershing, commander of U.S. forces in Europe during the war. During Stubby’s turn in the spotlight, Pershing praised him for “heroism of the highest caliber” and “bravery under fire.” The general then pinned a solid-gold medal to Stubby’s uniform. The Times observed that the happy hero “licked his chops and wagged his diminutive tail.”
Conroy and Stubby were never apart. When Conroy attended Georgetown University law school in 1921, Stubby went along and—in true Stubby manner—became the mascot of the Georgetown football team. At football games, he entertained crowds by butting the ball around the field with his nose. By the mid-1920s, Stubby, now approaching old age for a dog, was winding down. He died in his sleep in 1926, cradled in Conroy’s arms. Stubby’s final honor was recognition as a war hero by the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. His preserved body stands in a display case as if on alert. Beside him is a mannequin of a World War I soldier representing the many men who owed their lives to this brave dog.",1052.0

" Then, the elephant sprays the water from the end of its trunk into its mouth.
Elephants, especially female elephants, are social animals. Adult females live together in family groups, most often led by the oldest among them. The herd might be made up of a grandmother elephant, her grown-up daughters, and the daughters’ calves. They take care of each other and eat, bathe, and play together. From the moment an elephant is born, the whole herd helps the mother care for her 250-pound (110 kg) calf. Adult elephants work together to drive away predators. Other adults will even nurse the calf if it’s hungry.
Young elephants have an extra-long childhood and nurse from their mothers for up to three years. During this time, and for several years later, elephants learn vital survival skills, including where to find food and water, and how to use their trunks. They aren’t mature adults until they’re ten to fifteen years old. Then, males and females go their separate ways, with males leaving the herd to live alone or with other male elephants. Females stay with the herd and eventually raise their own calves. If an adult elephant doesn’t encounter serious trouble, it can live for sixty to seventy years. Sometimes an elephant lives so long that it runs out of teeth! It only grows six sets in its lifetime, and once they’re gone, the elephant can’t chew its food well anymore.
It’s hard not to feel a connection to nature’s king-sized elephants. We know they’re brainy and caring, and they like to have fun. Their awesome size and distinctive personalities make them impossible to ignore. If we all work to protect elephants, these giants of nature will roam the Earth for a long time to come.",847.0
" For example, a 1935 Hudson, N.Y., Sesquicentennial half dollar has a face value of 50 cents but was sold for $1 when it was first issued. Now it sells for between $1,000 and $5,000. Money made from the sale of commemorative coins is used to fund special projects.
When our nation was first formed, its economy depended largely on a mixture of foreign coins. Beginning in 1775, the Continental Congress issued currency to pay for the Revolutionary War. These notes, called Continentals, quickly became devalued because they were easily counterfeited and were not backed by gold or silver. On April 2, 1792, the United States Congress passed The Mint Act. For the first time, currency in the United States became standardized. Since then, U.S. coin production has grown from 1,500 coins a year to more than 11 billion coins a year, and the United States dollar has become one of the strongest currencies in the world.
The amount and type of money made in the United States has changed over the years. From Congress, to the U.S. Mint and the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, to the Federal Reserve banks, the government keeps coins and notes circulating and the value of U.S. money safe.
Many designs on money have changed to honor people and events in U.S. history. Security features have changed to keep counterfeiters from being able to use fake bills. New rules to keep pace with new technology mean the future holds further changes for U.S. currency. However, the function of money in the United States will remain the same. People will still use money to buy what they need and some of what they want. The use of money has become part of everyday life.",1079.0
" They had been attacking settlements and U.S. troops for years. Colonel Grierson and the 9th and 10th Cavalries were ordered to capture Victorio. After many battles and chases, they finally drove him into Mexico. He died there in 1880. Afterward, the 10th Cavalry remained in the Southwest for years, trying to bring the Apaches under control. The 9th Cavalry was sent to Indian Territory, where they fought outlaws and settlers who were trying to take land set aside for Native Americans.
The Buffalo Soldiers continued to work in the West, earning fourteen Medals of Honor between 1870 and 1890. The Medal of Honor is the highest award a U.S. soldier can earn. In 1898, the Buffalo Soldiers fought in the Spanish-American War. They took part in many battles and earned five Medals of Honor. Even so, some leaders in the U.S. Army still thought black soldiers were unable to perform as well as white soldiers.
After that war, between 1899 and 1904, the Buffalo Soldiers worked as park rangers, serving in several national parks in California. They built roads and trails, fought forest fires, and stopped people from hunting animals and stealing timber. During World Wars I and II, new black regiments formed, but they were still called Buffalo Soldiers and were still led by white officers. They were kept separate from white soldiers until the Korean War, when the troops were mixed in with other units.
People haven’t forgotten about the Buffalo Soldiers. Many books have been written about them and monuments raised to them. History remembers the Buffalo Soldiers as tough men who took on tough jobs. Although they were often treated poorly and often faced discrimination, they fought to prove they were good at their jobs. Their bravery and service are an important part of America’s story.",944.0
" At the equinoxes, the Sun crosses the equator, making day and night the same length. The people of Chichén Itzá may have used shadows on the pyramid as a calendar for planting and harvesting.
Today, Chichén Itzá is more popular than ever with tourists. Over one million people visit the site each year. Visitors can enter and explore many of the buildings, but some structures are off limits. For instance, visitors are no longer allowed to climb El Castillo. This rule helps protect the pyramid from the wear of climbers’ feet, and it also protects tourists from a possible fall.
Even though people can no longer climb the pyramid, there is still excitement for visitors. More than a thousand years ago, the builders planned an amazing event that people can still enjoy today. Twice a year when the Sun sets, its rays hit the edge of the pyramid and cast triangular shadows on one of the stairways. Slowly, the shadows move down like a slithering serpent. At the bottom of the stairs, the “serpent” connects to a stone carving of a giant snake head. Every year, visitors can enjoy this ancient animation.
While archaeologists have learned many things about Chichén Itzá, it remains a city of mystery. What do the carvings on the wall of the Great Ball Court tell us about the game and the Maya culture? When did the most powerful era in the city’s history end? And why did the Maya abandon Chichén Itzá in the 1400s? Today, historians continue to search for the answers to these questions. Those who work at the site are still unearthing structures and artifacts. There may still be items in the ruins that will reveal buried secrets about the history of Chichén Itzá.",905.0
" Some people take pieces home as souvenirs or to sell. Since 2011, the area of threatened reefs has increased by 30 percent. Even if we could stop global warming now, scientists predict that more than 90 percent of coral reefs will die by 2050. If we stand by and do nothing, though, we could lose them all.
Many countries have taken steps to preserve nearby reefs. In the United States, a government group makes maps of coral reefs. Satellite images help scientists watch for problems. Floating buoys measure sea levels, water temperature, wind speed, and air temperature. All this information helps scientists better understand reef damage and work to reduce it.
In Florida and on the Great Barrier Reef, it is against the law to take fish, plants, or coral from protected areas. People and boats are not allowed near many fragile reefs. But these efforts are only a start. Half of the world’s reefs have already been destroyed. Most of those that remain are threatened. It is up to all of us to help save coral reefs. Even if you don’t live near an ocean, you can help by doing your part to reduce global warming. Use less energy, walk or bike more, and recycle as much as you can.
You can also help by learning how communities around the world support resilient reefs. These reefs stay healthy or recover when faced with climate-related challenges. Community members plant crops that provide shade for coral reefs, which helps them stay cool. Other people grow plants that help prevent erosion and keep pollution from entering the ocean. Still others protect fish that help reefs maintain a balanced ecosystem. Each of us can do something to help coral reefs remain a beautiful natural wonder for centuries to come.

" Seats are spaced closely together, and seat backs are made to absorb an impact. This structure places passengers in a type of protective box. Interestingly, in most states, safety belts are not required on school buses, though a few states have passed bus safety belt laws. Other bus safety features may include flashing stop signs—to alert drivers that students are getting off or on the bus—and cameras that help drivers see what’s happening inside the bus and outside. We can expect to see more safety upgrades in the future.
Yellow Buses Go “Green”
Some school districts are also beginning to make changes to buses that help the environment. For instance, one school bus in New York has an electric engine that doesn’t pollute the air. The bus can travel for about 120 miles (190 km) before it needs to be recharged. Another “green” trend in school bus technology is the use of propane fuel. Propane is much less expensive than traditional bus fuel and less polluting, too.
School buses can also reduce pollution by replacing private vehicles on the road. The average school bus can drive fifty-four students. That eliminates about thirty-six private vehicles that would otherwise be used to drive students to school. This fact, along with newer, greener technology, can help keep the air cleaner.
As the school bus slows to a stop, Sarah opens her eyes, startled to find that she’s dozed off. She gathers her things and follows the other students off the bus. The bus pulls away from the curb, its job done for now. At the end of the day, it’ll be waiting for them, ready to start the whole journey again in reverse.",1012.0
" In the 1980s, Huerta pushed for the Immigration Reform and Control Act. In general, only American citizens can work in the United States. The government can allow people from other countries to work under certain programs. Seasonal farmworkers coming into the country were often stuck in the middle. Farms needed them, but it was difficult for them to work legally in the United States. Once the law was passed in 1986, it became easier for seasonal workers to find legal work.
Huerta was able to succeed as a female leader in a mostly male-dominated field. However, Huerta wants women to have more opportunities, especially in politics. In a 2017 interview with National Public Radio (NPR), she discussed the issues women face when struggling to balance work and family. She highlighted how important it is to have women in politics. “We do need women to run for office... we need a feminist to be at the table when decisions are being made so that the right decisions [that take women’s well-being into account] will be made.”
Huerta has also encouraged Latinas to run for office at all levels. In 2017, she supported Catherine Cortez Masto in her campaign to become the first Latina elected to the U.S. Senate. She was successful! Still, while Latinos made up approximately 17 percent of the U.S. population in 2017, Latino elected officials remain underrepresented.
Dolores Huerta has led a life of activism, including organizing and participating in protests, marches, and boycotts. She has worked persistently as a lobbyist for issues in which she believes. Huerta helped bring about important improvements in the lives of millions of farmworkers, from helping them gain the right to unionize to getting certain harmful pesticides banned. In many different ways, Dolores Huerta has made a lasting impact on American history.",1056.0
" By February 1, 1935, the work was finally completed. Workers plugged the diversion tunnels that had been allowing the Colorado’s waters to bypass the dam site. Water started rising behind the dam, overflowing the cofferdam, and forming Lake Mead. By the time the project was finished, more than 21,000 men had worked on it, with an average of 3,500 each day. The project cost $165 million, which is equal to $3 billion or more today.
Hoover Dam has welcomed visitors since 1937. Millions of people visit the dam each year, and close to a million take tours of the dam and power plant. The visitor center has displays about the region’s natural history as well as the history and construction of the dam. If you go, be prepared to be impressed. Visitors describe their experience with words like spectacular, amazing, and incredible. Fishing, boating, picnicking, and hiking are available year-round at Lake Mead. The area has nine wilderness areas, five hundred types of animals, and nine hundred types of plants.
The Colorado River is the main source of water in the southwestern United States. Hoover Dam controlled the Colorado for the first time in history and supplied farmers in Arizona, Nevada, and California with a trustworthy source of irrigation. The dam also provided drinking water and affordable electricity, which allowed Los Angeles, San Diego, Las Vegas, Phoenix, and other cities in the Southwest to grow. In addition, Hoover Dam provided jobs for thousands of men and became a symbol of hope during a very hard time.

" After Theseus killed the Minotaur, he followed the trail of yarn back out of the maze. The Minotaur myth was popular after the Greeks took over Crete. Just as Centaurs often represented the Persians, bulls could stand for Crete. Bulls were considered sacred to an important goddess in Crete. Theseus defeating the Minotaur could have symbolized the Greek conquest of Crete.
The fierce Minotaur was tiny compared to the giant Typhon (TY-fon), a winged monster with one hundred heads that represented the destructive forces of weather. Typhon had one human head and ninety-nine heads of other creatures, including lions, bulls, boars, snakes, and dragons. Below the knees, his legs were giant snakes. Instead of fingers, fifty serpent heads coiled forth from each hand. Fire flashed in his eyes, and flames whipped out of his mouth.
Only Zeus, the king of the gods, could match Typhon in battle. When Typhon threatened to take over the world, Zeus used thunder and lightning to combat Typhon’s fire and wind. Their battle shook the whole world. Zeus set all one hundred of Typhon’s heads on fire. He then imprisoned the monster beneath Earth. The ancient Greeks blamed Typhon for stirring strong winds that spread across land and sea during great storms. They also blamed him for sending forth lava from volcanoes. People were comforted by the idea that Zeus could defeat the destructive natural forces that Typhon represented.
Mythical creatures did not simply entertain or terrify the ancient Greeks. These creatures and the myths about them had deep meanings that helped people understand the world around them at the time and cope with challenges they faced. Mythical creatures played significant roles in ancient Greek culture, and they’re still popular today. Children and adults remain fascinated by their amazing stories.",962.0
" No decisions have been made yet about countries’ requests to own more of the Arctic region. Each country believes it has good reasons to expand its territory. The disputes continue to set the countries at odds with each other. Might there be a different approach to the changing Arctic region?
What About the South Pole?
The South Pole, at the other end of Earth’s axis, is also a place of extreme cold. Unlike the North Pole, however, it’s on a huge landmass—Antarctica, which is large enough to be called a continent. Since 1956, the United States has had a research station at the South Pole. Researchers study glaciers, Earth’s atmosphere, outer space, and more. Discoveries benefit all countries, not just the United States. An international agreement prevents any country from owning Antarctica or using its resources. The continent is set aside for scientific research and peaceful purposes only. No military activity is permitted there. Should those same guidelines be applied to the Arctic region?
Fifty or one hundred years from now, who will own the Arctic region, including the North Pole? Which path will win: peaceful cooperation or competition for control? Which direction do you think the Arctic countries should choose? A changing climate has changed our view of the Arctic region. As the region thaws and natural resources there become more available, countries are looking to the far north for new energy resources. In the years to come, as petroleum is likely to become much scarcer, this interest will only intensify. The countries that want to expand their areas of control in the Arctic region face important decisions. They need to consider economic, military, and other national concerns.

The few plants that can survive at this altitude must be able to withstand strong sunlight as well as subzero temperatures. Animals include birds of prey and a high-altitude spider.
• Almost nothing lives at Kibo’s summit (5,000– 5,895 meters [16,404–19,341 ft.]) because of the lack of water. Lichens are the main life forms.
Tanzania, where Mount Kilimanjaro is located, was called Tanganyika (tang-guh-NYEE-kuh) before it gained independence from Britain in 1961. Two years earlier, the country’s future president, Julius Nyerere (nih-RAIR-ee), said, “We, the people of Tanganyika, would like to light a candle and put it on the top of Mount Kilimanjaro.” He envisioned the candle shining beyond Tanganyika’s borders, “giving hope where there was despair, love where there was hate, and dignity where before there was only humiliation.” Because of Nyerere’s words, Kilimanjaro has become a symbol for independence for all of Africa. Kibo’s summit, called Uhuru Peak, gets its name from the Swahili word for “freedom.”
Mount Kilimanjaro is a rich natural area that is home to a wide variety of plants and animals, some found nowhere else on Earth. It is also a dramatic example of the creative force of volcanoes and a fascinating part of Earth’s geologic history.
To travelers who come from every corner of the world, Kilimanjaro is a mountain to climb and a personal goal to reach.

" They believe it might have been a large community project to unite people in the area. For fifteen hundred years, Stonehenge was an important center of activity. That came to an end about thirty-seven hundred years ago—no one knows why.
One of the most famous prehistoric landmarks in Europe, Stonehenge attracts more than nine hundred thousand tourists each year. At one time, visitors could touch and climb on the giant stones, but now they are mostly off-limits.
By 1900, many of the standing stones had fallen over, so British heritage groups decided to reconstruct the fallen stones using archaeological evidence. Giant cranes lifted the stones. Some standing stones were anchored in concrete. The restorers hoped these restorations would give the public a better idea of the monument’s original appearance.
Wowser!
At Stonehenge’s visitor center, tourists can see what life was like in England forty-five hundred years ago. Thatched-roof huts have been built using authentic materials and techniques. Volunteers show visitors ancient crafts and skills, such as rope weaving, pottery making, and stone knapping—the process of chipping flint to make stone tools.
Archaeologists continue to investigate the Stonehenge site. They use the latest technology such as magnetometers that detect magnetic fields, laser scanners that measure potential archaeological sites precisely, and ground-penetrating radar that can detect artifacts and structures hidden underground. These advances allow archaeologists to make new discoveries faster by showing them exactly where to dig.
The United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) named Stonehenge a World Heritage Site worthy of special recognition and protection. Stonehenge will continue to amaze people for thousands of years to come.

There are no definite answers to the global-warming problem, but many scientists around the world are looking into effective solutions. They feel it is in everyone’s best interest to understand as much as possible about decreasing the release of greenhouse gases.
Governments and industries around the world have taken steps to reduce ozone-destroying chemicals. They are cooperating in programs to measure and monitor the ozone layer. There are also things we can do as individuals to protect the atmosphere. We can stop producing more ground-level ozone by reducing the use of automobiles. And we can use hand-powered mowers instead of mowers that burn gasoline.
Protecting the upper-level ozone layer means trying to avoid releasing CFCs and ODCs into the atmosphere. Recycle the chemicals that cool old refrigerators and air conditioners. Avoid foam packaging, if possible. Write letters to industries that still use CFCs and ODCs, and ask them what they are doing to find alternatives.
Factories and certain products we use release chemicals that are destroying part of the protective blanket surrounding Earth. The chemicals being released into the air may be causing Earth’s atmosphere to warm up. Actions taken by governments from all around the world have helped ban certain chemicals. However, more action is needed to prevent future harm to our atmosphere.
The ozone problem has taught us many things. We now know that we need to control the use of certain chemicals. Scientists, politicians, and concerned citizens work together toward common goals. Perhaps the most important thing it has taught us is that we need to start thinking about how our current activities might affect not only people today, but also our future well-being and the health of our planet.",1043.0
" Motta remembers spending hundreds of hours putting a plane together. When one crashes, he picks up the pieces that are not damaged and keeps them as spares for other planes. Today, pilots can buy Almost-Ready-to-Fly (ARTF) planes. “Instead of two hundred hours building a plane, you can do it in about twenty,” Motta says. “In that time, you’ll have a plane that is respectable and good looking.”
While planes are challenging to fly, helicopters can be even more complicated to handle. Some types, such as mini helicopters, make learning to fly easier, especially indoors. Although these RC copters are small, they can still teach pilots many of the skills necessary to fly bigger helicopters. Quadrocopters, also known as quadcopters, have four spinning blades and can fly in all directions. Autogyros look like a cross between a plane and a helicopter. A propeller at the front or back moves the aircraft forward, which causes the unpowered blades on top to spin and keep the autogyro airborne.
RC technology isn’t all child’s play. Drones flown by pilots sitting miles away use the same basic technology and can do a variety of jobs. Within the next few years, remote-controlled drones could be flying in your neighborhood. Farmers might soon be using camera-carrying drones to locate crop-eating insects. Hospitals might use drones to fly human organs from one place to another for transplant. Some companies plan to use drones to deliver packages. TV crews used drones to cover the 2014 Winter Olympic Games in Sochi, Russia. The drones, operated by the Olympic Broadcasting Service, flew across the ski and snowboarding courses.

" Knowing Pompey still had command of his own armies, Caesar was left with no choice. Therefore, hoping to fix the broken government in Rome, Caesar crossed the Rubicon River with his armies in 49 and marched into the capital. Caesar believed he had the support of the citizens of Rome, but the result of his actions was a terrible civil war. Pompey brought his forces out to meet Caesar, but Caesar’s battle-tested troops quickly dominated and chased them out of Italy. Caesar pursued and destroyed Pompey’s army. Eventually, Pompey himself was killed.
Caesar returned to Rome a triumphant hero, but the government remained in crisis, and the Senate named Caesar dictator. Shortly before his death he was named dictator for life. Understandably, this greatly upset his opponents in the Senate. Rome was never supposed to be ruled by a king again, but in the Senate’s eyes, that was what appeared to be happening. In his short time as head of state, Caesar reformed the taxation system, began great public works, and granted Roman citizenship to many in the provinces. He was also very forgiving toward the many who had supported Pompey. This, combined with appearing as a king, led to Caesar’s downfall. On March 15, 44, the Ides of March, a group of senators assassinated Caesar.
Upon his murder, Caesar instantly became a martyr, and in 42 he was declared a god. The immediate aftermath of his assassination was chaos and, tragically, more civil war ensued. When it was finally over, the Roman Empire was born. The Roman Empire that Caesar put into motion carried on for centuries, shaping modern Europe and much of our world today.",1012.0

Many experts agree that the most recent growth of the Great Barrier Reef began between 6,000 and 8,000 years ago. At first glance, the Great Barrier Reef might look like a rock, but it’s not. It’s made from the outer skeletons of millions of animals called polyps (POL-ips), which are related to anemones and jellyfish. As the polyps die, new ones grow on top of the old skeletons. The many layers of skeletons form the limestone base of a coral reef. Other kinds of plants and animals also help make up the reef, such as algae, sponges, and shellfish. But the tiny polyp is responsible for most of this natural wonder’s structure.
Reefs are made from animals, and they supply food and shelter for other animals. They are sensitive to temperature changes in the ocean. Thousands of species live on the Reef, including 1,625 kinds of fish, more than 30 kinds of marine mammals, 50 kinds of seaweed, and 6 kinds of marine turtles. The Reef is also an important breeding area for animals, including birds, sea turtles, and several endangered species, such as the humpback whale and the sea cow.

People make kvass by soaking stale bread in water with yeast and sometimes other ingredients such as raisins or mint. Then they let the mixture sit for a few days. The finished product has a tangy, sour flavor. Some people use kvass to make a traditional soup called okroshka, which has cucumbers, meat such as sausages and salami, and boiled eggs as ingredients.

" But the French government owed money to King Charles. The English king delayed handing over the captured territories until the debt was repaid.
Finally, in March 1632, with the money paid, King Charles agreed to a new treaty returning all of New France to the French. Champlain was free at last to return to Quebec. He wasted no time in making preparations to do so. In 1633, Champlain returned to Quebec and resumed his duties as governor of New France. Upon his arrival in May, he was greeted warmly by both French colonists and his Indian friends. Champlain was now in his sixties, and he had led a full life. He was tired and feeling his age. Two years later—on Christmas Day 1635, a month after suffering a stroke—he died.
Samuel de Champlain’s accomplishments as an explorer and settler of the New World won him a secure place in history. Champlain traveled through what are now six Canadian provinces and five American states. His gift for establishing friendships with various Indian nations helped France establish a thriving fur trade and opened new areas for exploration. The little settlement he founded “where the river narrows” became Quebec City, the beautiful capital of the Canadian province of Quebec. Champlain had hoped that New France would endure as a French colony, but it was not to be. Over a period of about seventy-five years—from 1689 to 1763—France and England (after 1707, Great Britain) fought four more wars for control of New France.

" Their counting system was a base sixty, or sexagesimal, system. The way we measure time and calculate angles uses this same system, which originated thousands of years ago.
Around 3500 BCE, the Sumerians began using a round flat mechanical device to make clay bowls. The potter’s wheel sat horizontally on an axis and, when spun, allowed the potter to make a bowl with even edges and surfaces. It took a while for the Sumerians to realize they could use it as a way to easily move objects and transport people. After much experimenting, the Sumerians tried attaching one wheel to each side of a single axle. The result was a device that made it easy to carry loads. The cart rolled across the ground with minimal effort. Other civilizations copied the Sumerians’ invention, and wheels were soon used across the civilized world.
The Akkadian Empire ended about 2150 after many internal uprisings and an invasion by the Gutians (GOO-tee-uhnz), who were nomads from the mountains to the north. Gutian war parties held regular raids on the outer reaches of the kingdom. As a result, trade slowed and fields lay untended. The Akkadian ruler at that time, Shar-Kali-Sharri, struggled to maintain control as the Gutians intruded farther into Mesopotamia. Eventually, the Gutian nomads took over Akkad, and the Akkadian Empire collapsed.
The barbaric Gutians had little understanding of how a civilized society functioned. They were poor administrators. They allowed the canal network to fall into disrepair and brought on a terrible famine. Their 125-year rule of Sumer led to what came to be known as the Dark Age of Mesopotamia.

" He sent 700 British soldiers to take control of the weapons on the night of April 18, 1775. Gage also planned to arrest the leaders of the rebellion—Samuel Adams and John Hancock—who were in Lexington, a town not far from Concord. A Patriot doctor, Samuel Prescott, discovered Gage’s plans and warned the militia that the British were coming. On the way to Concord, the British soldiers encountered a group of 70 militiamen waiting for them on the village green in Lexington. The British soldiers tried to walk past the militiamen, but an unordered shot rang out. No one is sure which side fired the first shot, but that shot started the Revolutionary War. It would become known as “the shot heard ’round the world.” In the fighting that followed, eight militiamen died and ten were wounded, while the British suffered extensive losses. The British continued on to Concord.
The British destroyed some supplies in Concord, but the Americans had moved most of their weapons, hiding them before the British arrived. Patriot leaders Hancock and Adams escaped arrest. The Massachusetts militia arrived at Concord with nearly 500 men. They attacked the exhausted British soldiers at Concord’s North Bridge and continued the attack the next day as the British soldiers began to march back to Boston. The soldiers were retreating from the fight. The militiamen hid behind trees and stone walls to fire upon the lines of British soldiers, just as the French and Native Americans had during the Seven Years’ War. The professional British soldiers were humiliated by their defeat at the hands of a ragtag group of quickly trained colonists. At Lexington and Concord, 273 British soldiers and 93 militiamen died.

" The light comes from a special process called bioluminescence. This is the same process that produces light in fireflies. Jellyfish, squid, fish, and even bacteria are bioluminescent in this zone, where there is no sunlight. These lights make it possible for animals to see and communicate with each other. These lights also help them find mates or food, and they also make them incredibly beautiful. Some oceanographers divide the midnight zone into two additional zones: the abyssal zone and ocean trenches. The abyssal zone is totally dark, and it covers much of the ocean floor, including vast plains, mountains, valleys, and canyons.
Ocean trenches occur along faults where large plates of the Earth’s crust come together. The colliding plates create canyons and cracks of up to 10,000 meters (32,808 ft) deep. You would think that nothing could survive at the bottom of a trench in the darkness, cold, and pressure. But openings at the bottom of the trenches spew hot water and minerals from deep within the Earth.
Animals living in this zone have taken advantage of the warmth and nutrients. Special kinds of bacteria can use these nutrients in the same way that phytoplankton use sunlight. Tube worms, shrimp, and giant clams can all be found feeding on these bacteria around the openings, or chimneys. These chimneys were only recently discovered. Only a few submersibles, or submarines, have been built strong enough to withstand the enormous pressure at the bottom of a trench.
So you see, even though phytoplankton are only at the top of the ocean, we’re at the center of the food web, supporting all other life in the sea. Whether you enjoy the ocean for the beauty of coral reefs, the mystery of the abyssal zone, or some tasty fish and chips, you have us phytoplankton to thank.",1007.0

Today The Bill of Rights and other amendments to the Constitution guarantee the rights of all Americans, but sometimes people have to fight to keep their rights. That’s what happened to Alondra Jones. Alondra was an honor student at Balboa High School in San Francisco in the year 2000. Although she was a top student, Alondra struggled to graduate because her school had so many problems. Her high school didn’t have enough textbooks to go around, and there were no computers for students to use. The buildings were filthy, poorly maintained, and infested with rats. One day, Alondra visited another school where students had books, computers, and clean, safe buildings. That trip made Alondra realize that her school was very different from many other schools in her state.
Alondra decided to stand up for her rights. She joined almost one hundred other students in a lawsuit that forced the California Board of Education to change the way it funded its public schools. The lawsuit was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), a nonprofit legal organization that defends the rights of American citizens. The court that decided the case said that California was not giving “equal protection” to its students as required by the Fourteenth Amendment. It said that students like Alondra had a right to expect public schools in which they could get a good education regardless of their socioeconomic status.
The story of individual rights in America began with the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. It continues to change through new laws, new amendments, and the actions of citizens like Alondra who are willing to stand up for their rights. The Founders of the United States created a system that promised liberty and freedom to its citizens. It is up to all Americans to keep that promise alive.",1141.0
"” He poured, splattered, and threw paint on canvases laid on the ground, not perched on a standard artist’s easel. Abstract expressionists broke free of tradition and by doing so changed the future course of art.In the past, I would never have considered this type of painting art. After listening to Chloe explain Pollock’s inspiration, however, I now have a better understanding. I remember another thing Chloe told us: that pretty landscapes and realistic-looking people are not necessarily what makes good art. Rather, she says, it’s the art’s context, inspiration, and cultural impact. These aspects help us understand art’s significance and help us decide what we think about it. I’ll have to think about that one, but I feel like I’m starting to get what she means.
By now, my legs are getting pretty tired. Chloe leads us past hundreds of European paintings. I catch glimpses of famous works by Van Gogh and Monet before we head down the giant staircase and back to the Great Hall to end the tour. I’m overwhelmed by how much I’ve just seen and learned. The Met is an awe-inspiring place. It’s as if I’ve traveled around the world and back in time in a one-hour tour. Up until now, I had completely underestimated why art is so important. As I exit the museum, the sights, sounds, and smells of New York City bombard my senses. I take a break and sit on the great steps in front of the Met. I want to jot down some ideas for my assignment while they’re still fresh in my mind.

The Mole fell backwards on the snow from sheer surprise and delight. “Rat!” he cried in penitence, “you’re a wonder! A real wonder, that’s what you are. I see it all now! You argued it out, step-by-step, in that wise head of yours, from the very moment that I fell and cut my shin, and you looked at the cut, and at once your majestic mind said to itself, ‘Door scraper!’ And then you turned to and found the very door scraper that done it! Did you stop there? No. Some people would have been quite satisfied; but not you. Your intellect went on working. ‘Let me only just find a doormat,’ says you to yourself, ‘and my theory is proved!’ And of course you found your doormat. You’re so clever, I believe you could find anything you liked. ‘Now,’ says you, ‘that door exists, as plain as if I saw it. There’s nothing else remains to be done but to find it!’ Well, I’ve read about that sort of thing in books, but I’ve never come across it before in real life. You ought to go where you’ll be properly appreciated. You’re simply wasted here, among us fellows. If I only had your head, Ratty—”

" According to the Institute of Mechanical Engineers, which released a food study in January 2013, almost 50 percent of food produced is wasted. Grain is the world’s most important source of food. Yet as meat production has boomed for rich and developing countries, a third of the grain grown worldwide is used to feed livestock. It takes between 11 pounds (4.99 kg) and 16 pounds (7.25 kg) of grain and about 5,214 gallons (19,737 L) of water to create 1 pound (0.45 kg) of meat. Eating less meat means more grain and more water available for people in poor countries and protection of valuable grasslands. Average Americans use 3 times the food and 250 times the fresh water needed to survive. They could reduce their ecological footprint by eating smarter, recycling, and conserving energy. Americans are the world’s biggest consumers; they consume 20 percent of the world’s energy. They could instead be the world’s most efficient consumers if they make intelligent choices about how to live.
The Rapanui left records on carved tablets, but no one has been able to translate the ancient language yet. We might never know for sure what happened, but some experts believe that as Easter Island became overpopulated, the tribes fought for resources, the moai were toppled, and thousands died. Eventually, Europeans brought diseases that killed more. By 1877, only 111 people remained. Today, Easter Island’s population is growing again. Some of the moai have been restored. But most of the native plants and animals have become extinct, and the ancient culture of the Rapanui is lost. Hopefully, the tale of this little island can teach us to protect our limited resources on Earth, our own little island in space.",1061.0
" There is no easy way to remove oil from the environment once it’s been spilled. Authorities used a variety of methods to deal with the damage from the spill.
Absorption: Special towels are used to absorb oil that is coating sand and other material along the shore. Burning: When conditions are fairly calm and the oil is fairly thick, it can be set on fire. Burning removes oil from the surface but fills the air with harmful black smoke.
Chemicals: Planes flying over an oil spill drop chemicals that break the oil into tiny droplets that sink below the surface. Natural bacteria living in the ocean water then eat the droplets. Containment: Booms, or long floating tubes, are strung out to form a barrier to prevent the oil from spreading. Microbes: Tiny, microscopic oil-eating organisms are spread over the spill. They eat and digest Power washing: Power sprayers are used to remove oil from rocks and other objects that get coated with oil that comes ashore. Skimming: Ships with special equipment are used to skim oil collected within floating booms.
As long as the world depends on oil for energy, there will be pressure to look for new sources of oil. Many people oppose offshore drilling and the use of tanker ships to move oil across the oceans. They say the risks of oil spilling and leaking are not risks worth taking. Many others argue that our growing energy needs make drilling through the ocean floor necessary. Scientists know that big pockets of oil lie beneath the ocean floor in many regions of the world. Those who favor offshore drilling believe that taking proper safety precautions will minimize the risks involved. But as the Deepwater Horizon accident and others like it show, we can never guarantee that large oil spills won’t happen.",971.0
" That floor also has interactive displays about the tower and shows with views of the city projected onto three walls. In addition, it has restaurants and shops as well as a piece of the original spiral staircase to Eiffel’s office. Since 2004, the first floor has also featured an ice-skating rink every winter. The second floor—115 meters (377 ft.) high—has souvenir shops, restaurants, and “story windows” that describe the tower’s construction. A glass window offers a plunging view down to ground level.
Visitors can enjoy great views of the Eiffel Tower from many different angles by riding in a glass elevator. At the top—276 meters (906 ft.) above the ground—is a stunning view of Paris. Two levels, one covered and the other uncovered, allow people to enjoy the view day or night in any weather. Gustave Eiffel’s restored office is also on the top floor, as well as panoramic maps with directions and distances to other big cities. All three floors of the tower offer many opportunities for outstanding photos.
If Gustave Eiffel and his team were alive today, they would no doubt be pleased that their engineering wonder has brought so much joy to people around the world. Almost seven million people visit the Eiffel Tower each year. It’s been an important part of the plot in dozens of novels and movies, and it has inspired over thirty replicas. The tower is also the site of dazzling light and fireworks shows, including an amazing one to celebrate the beginning of the year 2000.

" The first ones were on the 3rd, 9th, and 24th floors. As the building grew taller, two more were added, one on the 47th floor and the other on the 64th floor.
The builders, or contractors, were supposed to stick to the schedule—and they did. They not only planned everything, but they also kept track of everything—such as how many bricks were laid and how much plaster was applied. With so much careful planning, you might think everything went well. It didn’t. One plan was a huge failure. Al Smith wanted the spire that rose above the 86th floor to be a stopping spot for airships. These airships, or dirigibles, were the modern way to travel back then. Smith said passengers could simply walk down a plank from a dirigible to the 102nd floor. Then they could take the elevator down and be on Fifth Avenue in minutes. It all sounded great, but when the first airship got close to the mast, the winds were too strong. The winds around the skyscraper are always too strong, so the plan was dropped.
Al Smith Was Right!
The Empire State Building opened on May 1, 1931, a little over a year after the first steel columns were set in place. The speed with which the tallest building in the world was constructed set a record that has not been broken to this day. Just after the building’s fiftieth birthday, it was declared a landmark, which means that by law it must be preserved to appear just as it always has. Today the world’s most famous office building is still a prominent feature of New York City’s skyline. Al Smith was absolutely right when he declared that the building had been built for generations to come.",970.0
" The idea behind overtime pay was to discourage employers from overworking employees and encourage employers to hire more workers (to avoid having to pay overtime). The act also established safety regulations in the workplace and banned most kinds of child labor. It set the minimum age at sixteen during school hours, fourteen for certain after-school jobs, and eighteen for dangerous jobs.
Labor Day was first celebrated in New York City in 1882. The celebration was held by the Central Labor Union of New York to give all working citizens a day off. In 1887, Oregon became the first state to pass a law making Labor Day an official holiday. Thirty more states passed similar laws before the U.S. government made Labor Day an official nationwide holiday in 1894.
Canada also celebrates Labor Day on the first Monday in September. More than sixty other countries around the world instead celebrate International Workers’ Day on May 1. The inspiration for International Workers’ Day was the May 4, 1886, Haymarket Affair in Chicago. Important people, including the president, give speeches on Labor Day, and parades have been common since the holiday began. Many communities also have festivals featuring music, crafts, boating, fall foods, classic cars, or other themes.
The labor movement improved the way workers are treated and paid. It set limits for workdays and workweeks, introduced safety regulations, brought an end to child labor, and more. Labor Day honors these accomplishments as well as the efforts of all American workers to build and sustain their country. So enjoy a day off on Labor Day and be sure to have some fun. Just remember to take a moment to honor the workers who labored to build a better future for themselves, their families, and every American citizen.",1151.0

Some smartphone apps can only identify colors after the user snaps a photo, but others can analyze them in the camera’s viewfinder without requiring the user to take a photo first. This lets users identify colors in real time.
Researchers have also created high-tech tinted lenses that filter out specific wavelengths of light. Special sunglasses that use these lenses allow people with red-green color blindness to distinguish between the two colors.
Although no true treatment for color blindness currently exists, that may soon change. In recent experiments, scientists were able to correct red-green color blindness in squirrel monkeys. The monkeys lacked the red photopigment and, as a result, couldn’t tell the difference between red and green. Researchers engineered a specially constructed virus to insert the red photopigment gene into the monkeys’ green cone cells. Within about twenty weeks, treated monkeys could distinguish between red and green dots.
This was exciting news! The monkeys had been color-blind since birth. Many doctors and scientists had predicted that it would be impossible to correct their color blindness because the monkeys’ brains would not have developed the connections needed to interpret color information. These connections usually develop when the animals are young.
Now that we know that color blindness can be cured in adult squirrel monkeys, there’s hope for a cure in adult humans, too.
Color Vision for All?
Every year, researchers gain a better understanding of color blindness and its causes. New tools help color-blind people choose ripe fruit and pick out matching clothes. People with red- green color blindness can use special glasses to allow them to tell the difference between shades of red and green.
Best of all, a treatment for color blindness may be available in the near future. Maybe someday soon, color blindness will become a thing of the past!",1111.0
" He entered many competitions around the United States. Five years after his retirement from the Air Force, Joe set yet another record. He flew a helium-filled balloon from Las Vegas, Nevada, to Franklinville, New York—a distance of 3,220 kilometers (2,000 mi). It took him 72 hours to fly the record-setting distance.
In 1984, at the age of 56, Joe decided to go for another record. No one had flown a balloon alone across the Atlantic Ocean—all the more reason for Joe to try it. On September 14, 1984, he took off from the state of Maine and drifted eastward. Almost 84 hours and 5,633 kilometers (3,500 mi) later, he landed his balloon in Italy. Joe had set another record.
The dictionary defines a hero as someone who commits an act of bravery or who shows great courage when undertaking a task. Based on this definition, Joe is certainly a hero. Many heroes in fields like exploration become well known, with their names appearing in the news and in textbooks. Joe Kittinger is not a name that comes to mind in connection with space exploration. In this sense, Joe is an unsung hero. His early work with high-altitude balloons was not undertaken for the purpose of setting records, but rather for the benefit of pilots and astronauts.
Despite being relatively unknown to the general public, Joe was recognized for his outstanding accomplishments. U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower awarded him the Harmon Trophy after Joe set the record for a high-altitude jump. Joe received many other awards and honors for his military, ballooning, and parachuting achievements, including the Silver Star, Distinguished Flying Cross, and Purple Heart.

" Take the cocklebur. A Swiss engineer named George de Mestral became curious about the cockleburs that stuck to his clothing and his dog’s fur. Wondering how they attached themselves so firmly, he took a closer look at the burrs under a microscope. He saw that they had tiny hooks that latched onto loops in the fabric of his pants.
Inspired by nature’s hook-and-loop fastener, de Mestral worked to recreate the design using fabric. Years later, the result was Velcro. Velcro is made up of two pieces of fabric, one covered in thousands of tiny hooks and the other covered in thousands of tiny loops. The hooks and loops allow the two pieces of fabric to “zip” together.
Magnified One Million Times (1,000,000x)
Because of the way light works, there is a limit to how much magnification a compound microscope can achieve. During the last century, scientists developed microscopes that use different ways to illuminate samples, including ultraviolet light and beams of energy called electron particles.
Microscopes that use electron beams to illuminate samples are called electron microscopes. They provide the greatest magnification of any type of microscope currently in existence. They can magnify samples up to one million times (1,000,000x)!
With each new degree of magnification, more detail is revealed about the tiniest structures of plants, animals, and materials. As a result, microscopes have allowed countless discoveries in nearly every field of science.
Microscopes make the invisible visible, allowing us to explore the world in an entirely new way.
Many cells and other small objects are transparent, or see-through. This makes them difficult to see under a microscope. Stains and dyes have been used since the 1800s to make objects stand out more against their backgrounds. This makes the objects easier to see with a microscope.",1070.0

In the beginning, the rapper was called the MC (Master of Ceremonies). As the DJ played music, the MC did a call-and-response to excite the crowd (MC: “Everybody say ho!” Audience: “HO!”). Rappers soon found they could please the audience even more by making simple rhymes that worked with the beat. A rapper was judged by the content, flow, and delivery of his or her rap. The content covered a wide range of subjects—from boastful rhymes to social and political commentary; all were fair game. The flow meant staying true to the beat while delivering the lyrics. To keep the same rhythm as the music, rappers stress a particular syllable to match the beat. Good delivery showed the mastery of the voice. This involved vocal presence (a unique, recognizable rapping voice), enunciation (clarity or stylized slurring of words), and breath control (breathing without interrupting flow).
Although breaking, graffiti art, and DJing are still popular, rap as a musical art form clearly broke away from the pack. In the beginning, the rapper was just a part of the hip-hop party. But once hip-hop records started becoming successful, the rappers themselves became the stars. Now, rap music has grown to the point where it is heard in almost all forms of music today, from hard rock to country pop.
In the early 1980s, as rap records became popular around the world, hip-hop culture became a global phenomenon. What started at a young girl’s street party in the South Bronx in 1973 has become a part of the world’s popular culture. Poverty and the lack of means to develop new mainstream music led to creativity and some of the most influential sounds of the twentieth century. All it took was imagination, the ability to express oneself, and the desire to have fun.",1098.0
" He did not know that when the Fairy kissed him that last time she had changed him altogether. And he might have sat there a long time, too shy to move, if just then something hadn’t tickled his nose, and before he thought what he was doing he lifted his hind toe to scratch it.
And he found that he actually had hind legs! Instead of dingy velveteen he had brown fur, soft and shiny, his ears twitched by themselves, and his whiskers were so long that they brushed the grass. He gave one leap and the joy of using those hind legs was so great that he went springing about the turf on them, jumping sideways and whirling round as the others did, and he grew so excited that when at last he did stop to look for the Fairy she had gone.

" No one has ever observed a whale shark birth, so scientists can only speculate about the event. They suspect that whale sharks give birth in the open ocean rather than near shore. Newborn pups grow more quickly than older juveniles, and females grow more quickly than males and are larger when full-grown. Whale sharks reach maturity at around thirty years of age. No one knows how long they live, but sharks as a group live for a long time. Because of whale sharks’ large size, scientists think they could live for one hundred years.
Whale sharks are hunted for their meat, skin, fins, and liver oil. They are easy to hunt because they often swim near the water’s surface, and they’re vulnerable to collisions with ships for the same reason. In addition, whale sharks are often caught by accident when people are fishing for other species. Pollution, destruction of their habitat, and factors related to climate change are additional threats to whale sharks. Whale sharks are not yet endangered, but they are classified as “vulnerable”—in danger of becoming endangered. Some countries have placed limits on the numbers of whale sharks that can be hunted in order to try to protect them from further decline. In addition, ecotourism is helping call attention to the value of these animals as one of Earth’s treasures.
You’re snorkeling again—this time in the Gulf A Streak of Luck of Mexico. As an enormous whale shark swims near, you have no fear.

" In 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt asked to meet with Muir to better understand the needs of wilderness areas in the West. Honored, Muir took him on a camping trip into Yosemite. Muir used the opportunity to advocate for setting aside wilderness areas as protected parks. As a result of that trip, more areas of Yosemite became part of the national park. Roosevelt also set aside many other wilderness areas for protection, including Crater Lake and Wind Cave National Parks. In his later years, Muir spent more time writing about his travels. He was awarded honorary degrees from four universities. Muir also led a twelve-year fight to protect Yosemite’s Hetch Hetchy Valley from being flooded by a proposed dam. Despite efforts to stop the project, including a letter Muir wrote to Congress, it was approved in 1913. However, the fight raised public awareness about the protection of wild places. It also contributed to the 1916 creation of the National Park Service, which established stronger protections for all U.S. national parks. John Muir died on December 24, 1914. Although he did not live to see the founding of the National Park Service, his efforts helped make it a reality.
John Muir was one of the first people to call for practical action on behalf of preserving wild places. As a founding father of the conservation movement, he devoted much of his life to protecting wilderness areas for future generations. John Muir came from humble beginnings and struggled for years to find his true path in life. Yet the natural world always called to him, inviting him to know it better and witness more of its wonders. As he did, his purpose became clear.

" When they have nothing else to do, however, many simply look out the windows or take photos. Who can blame them? The view is pretty amazing.
Exercise is incredibly important for astronauts. When people exercise on Earth, their bones and muscles must work against gravity, which makes them stronger. Because of the lack of gravity in space, it takes very little strength or effort to move things that might be extremely heavy on Earth. Because of this ease, astronauts’ bones and muscles weaken over time. To slow the decline, astronauts must work out at least two hours every day. The special equipment in the ISS gym includes a treadmill that uses straps to pull down on the astronauts as they run. Other exercise equipment in the gym uses resistance to help the astronauts stay strong. Even with such a grueling daily workout, most astronauts lose 20 to 30 percent of their muscle mass during their six-month stay.
When astronauts return to Earth from the ISS, the work isn’t over. Recovery from an extended period in space takes a long time. For a six-month stay on the ISS, astronauts have about six weeks of rehabilitation to regain lost muscle. It can take a whole year for an astronaut’s bones to fully recover. Despite all the hard work and inconvenience astronauts must endure, they know the time spent living and working in space is worth it. During their time in space and rehabilitation afterward, scientists monitor the astronauts’ physical and mental health. The information they gather has already helped astronauts live healthier and happier lives. As we look farther into space—to places that may take months, years, or even decades to reach—this vital information might mean the success or failure of future space exploration.",1045.0

On November 9, 1975, SS Edmund Fitzgerald, a huge freighter, left Superior, Wisconsin, fully loaded with iron ore. A storm was forecast, but the captain was not concerned. On the afternoon of November 10, the U.S. Coast Guard warned all ships to seek shelter. The Edmund Fitzgerald headed for Whitefish Bay, Wisconsin. At about 7:00 p.m., the captain reported the ship was taking on water but radioed, “We are holding our own.” Moments later, the ship no longer appeared on radar. No lifeboats were launched. None of the twenty-nine crew members were found. Days later, the Coast Guard located the wreck on the lake floor. The ship had been snapped in half. Investigators suspect a series of three rogue waves may have sunk the ship so quickly there was no time even to make a distress call.
Sailing the seas has always been a great adventure, one that has inspired thousands of novels and movies. Part of any true adventure, though, is the element of danger—and the sea has plenty of it. The oceans stretch vast distances, weather can turn suddenly savage, and threatening reefs and rocks hide along coastlines. Modern equipment makes shipping safer than ever, but dozens of shipwrecks still claim the lives of about two thousand people every year. Working on a ship remains one of the world’s most dangerous jobs. Sailors entrust their lives to their knowledge, skills, and the ships they serve on, but sometimes, they are left to depend on only their luck. Every shipwreck leaves behind mysteries. Some of these mysteries can be explored and eventually explained, and older wrecks may provide us with a glimpse into the past. Much of the time, though, the sea’s secrets are never revealed.",999.0

His Twitter site became one of the top 140 sites in the world, and he appeared in a Superman comic book and on the television comedy The Big Bang Theory. Tyson uses his fame to encourage better science and math education in schools, saying, “Kids are never the problem. They are born scientists. The problem is always the adults... That’s why my public focus is primarily adults.” He calls for more funding for space research, saying space gets people excited about science and that research and technology drive our economy. He points out that less than half a penny of each tax dollar goes to NASA—a small price to pay for keeping the United States a world leader in technology.
In 2014, Tyson hosted a new TV series called Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey. The original Cosmos series—the most watched program ever on PBS—aired in 1980 and was hosted by Carl Sagan, the man who had inspired the young Tyson.

" Mission simulators allow trainees to hone these skills. One mission has participants launch the space shuttle, fly it to the International Space Station, and dock the craft. Team members perform a variety of duties, but they must communicate on their headsets. Just like a real crew, they run through checklists to ensure that they remember their tasks exactly and stick to the schedule. Some trainees serve as astronauts, and others work in Mission Control, the command center back “on Earth.” Some simulated missions include mock voyages to the Moon, while others take place on models of a space station or other spacecraft. The crew must be ready to think fast if the simulator creates an emergency for them to deal with, such as a simulated engine problem or sudden meteor shower. For older trainees, a few space camps have made simulations for the future: a mission to Mars. Crews work together aboard life-size models of the Orion capsule and Mars lander at the space camp in Alabama. Real astronauts will live on Orion during the planned voyage to and from Mars. They will use the landing module to fly to the Martian surface and return to the Orion, which will remain in orbit around Mars.

DNA fingerprinting has helped solve many crimes since it was first used in 1985. However, some people are concerned about possible contamination affecting the accuracy of DNA testing as well as its possible misuse. Even so, DNA fingerprinting will continue to be used as long as it helps identify criminals and solve crimes.
Genetics is also used by many medical and health-care scientists. Genetics is used to diagnose, treat, and prevent diseases as well as to develop new medicines. Medical scientists are now discovering many genes that cause specific diseases. Identifying genes that cause a specific disease helps scientists develop medicines and vaccines to cure or prevent the disease. Genetics counselors also use genetics. They help parents and future parents figure out the odds of passing on genetic disorders to their children. Parents use this information to help them decide whether to have children or how to cope with the possibility of caring for children with genetic disorders. Some common genetic disorders that may be passed on from parents to their children are cystic fibrosis, Huntington’s disease, and breast cancer.
The field of genetics offers many job opportunities. Genetics is an exciting and relatively new branch of science that brings new developments and new opportunities almost daily. Whether in plant and animal breeding, medicine, criminology, or some other field, many career opportunities are linked to genetics.

" Buildings not already on fire were blown up to create firebreaks. Then on October 10, rain fell to help the firefighters extinguish the flames. The fire finally ended. Though everyone was relieved, they soon realized their loss. About 300 people had died; others remained missing. People’s homes, possessions, and workplaces were gone, dust and ash still filled the air, and areas of the city remained too hot to enter. Federal troops, commanded by General Philip Sheridan, arrived to prevent looting. People sent supplies and volunteers to Chicago, and the fortunate survivors collected food and clothing for the homeless.
The Chicago Relief and Aid Society opened homeless shelters and later provided materials for the building of small temporary houses. Business owners set up tables or carts and got back to work, and while many left the city as soon as possible, most stayed to rebuild. The rebuilding went rather slowly. People resisted making changes that would prevent another fire, but gradually they realized the need for stricter building and fire-prevention rules. They built safer housing, and officials improved the fire department. Again, people had learned a hard lesson.
Today, we are lucky to live in a time when fire safety is given great importance. Every area of the country has strict fire codes, and professional and volunteer fire departments train in fire prevention, firefighting, and lifesaving techniques. Buildings have fire alarms and sprinkler systems, and firewalls are built between houses. People learn from schools and the media what to do to prevent fires and how to plan for emergencies. Even with all this effort, terrible fires still occur. But because of modern fire prevention and firefighting, we hope to never see fires like the ones of Rome, London, and Chicago ever again.",1047.0
" Lincoln was finally convinced that as president, he had the authority to order abolition in the South. On January 1, 1863, the Emancipation Proclamation went into effect, freeing “thenceforth and forever” all the slaves in the South. Freed blacks rushed to join the Union army, and by the end of the war, over 180,000 former slaves had volunteered.
The summer of 1863 brought victory to Union forces at Gettysburg, a turning point in the war. President Lincoln, while dedicating a cemetery to the many soldiers who had died, delivered his famous Gettysburg Address. The speech lasted only two minutes, yet it is remembered for its simple beauty and eloquence. Lincoln spoke of the war as a test of whether the nation could survive as a democracy. He challenged those still alive to complete the unfinished work of those who had died, “that the government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.”
Under the newly named General Ulysses S. Grant, the Union armies won victories in the West and South. Lincoln saw hope of the war’s end as Confederate troops were defeated in Georgia and Virginia in late 1864. He was re-elected president and, in early 1865, cheered the Congressional passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which prohibited slavery in the United States.
The war ended on April 9, 1865, four years after it began, and cost 600,000 lives. The Union survived, and slavery was abolished. But only six days later, President Abraham Lincoln lay dead from an assassin’s bullet. A Confederate sympathizer, John Wilkes Booth, shot Lincoln while he attended a play at Washington’s Ford’s Theatre. As Lincoln’s body was carried back to his beloved Illinois on a funeral train, mourners by the roadside silently saluted this great American hero.",1147.0
"
The United States would not be able to stay out of the war, however, because British and French ships began seizing and searching U.S. ships in order to keep supplies from reaching their enemies. The British also seized the sailors on the ships they took, forcing them to serve as British sailors. This made U.S. citizens who had gained independence from Britain subject to Great Britain’s tyranny again. In 1812, President Madison told Britain to stop searching and seizing U.S. ships or there would be war. Not satisfied with the response, Madison declared war with Britain on June 18, 1812. The United States did not have the navy to fight Britain on the seas. An invasion to conquer British-controlled Canada failed, proving the army could not take on the giant nation again. For two and a half years, the United States remained at war with Britain. On December 24, 1814, the two countries signed a peace treaty to end the war.
Even though the war had officially ended, the United States engaged in one more battle against the British. On January 8, 1815, Americans decisively won the Battle of New Orleans under General Andrew Jackson (who was unaware a peace treaty had been signed). Almost three hundred British soldiers died. The U.S. death toll was less than twenty. The victory at the Battle of New Orleans made it clear that the United States, not Great Britain, truly controlled the western part of the country. It also made U.S. citizens feel like they had won the War of 1812, although, in truth, neither side was victorious. Maybe the most important outcome was that the late victory made the new United States of America feel truly united as one nation.",1116.0
" They then take a DNA sample from the suspect. If the two samples match, the investigators are closer to solving the crime. Law enforcement agencies are now building databases of DNA samples, much like they keep collections of fingerprints. These databases contain the DNA fingerprints of convicted criminals, as well as other evidence found at crime scenes. DNA also has been used to free people who were wrongly convicted of crimes.
DNA fingerprinting has helped solve many crimes since it was first used in 1985. However, some people are concerned about possible contamination affecting the accuracy of DNA testing as well as its possible misuse.

" As with any puzzle, every piece matters. It looks more and more as though CCD is a complicated blend of biological, chemical, and physical stresses.
Because of the complexity of CCD, scientists have yet to pinpoint the cause and recommend a cure. Solving the case of the disappearing honeybees will likely require additional research. In the meantime, we can use what we do know to create bee-friendly environments that will benefit plants, bees, and people. Honeybees benefit from having a variety of native wildflowers. Variety means ample forage and longer foraging seasons. People can create honeybee sanctuaries, places full of blooming plants where bees can avoid pesticides and thrive in a natural environment.
Reducing the need for bee transport is another way to reduce stress on honeybee populations. One way to do so is to establish permanent local apiaries. Rooftop and backyard beekeeping is becoming popular in many communities. Cities such as Seattle, Chicago, San Francisco, and even New York have made it legal to raise bees. The bees visit parks and gardens, producing honey and pollinating native fruit trees and plants. Even monoculture farmers can find small ways to help bees without sacrificing their harvest. Setting aside a small area to grow plants that would sustain bees all year long instead of just for a couple of weeks each year would support a population of homegrown pollinators. Farmers could even investigate more organic means of pest control that would let them avoid using toxic chemicals.
There is much we can do to help honeybees while scientists work to solve the mystery of colony collapse disorder. Honeybees are small but important contributors to the health and well-being of many other species, including humans. Taking action to protect them helps not only the bees but us as well.",1146.0
" Many canes had been found in his tomb. The researchers also found other evidence of what might have killed Tut. The scans showed that he had suffered a broken leg shortly before his death, and it had not healed properly. Hawass said the king may have developed an infection from the injury and died a few days later. From 2007 to 2010 researchers, including Hawass, studied Tut’s remains further using genetic tests. The new genetic tests showed the researchers two important conditions they hadn’t seen before. They found evidence that King Tut had multiple attacks of severe malaria, which was common in Egypt. The disease alone probably wouldn’t have killed Tut, but it may have left him very weak. They also found evidence of a deterioration of the bones in Tut’s left foot, called bone necrosis, which may have left the young king susceptible to other infections not yet discovered.
Mystery Solved?
So, is that the end of the mystery? Did young King Tut die from a combination of physical problems, an accident, a disease, and/or an infection from a broken leg? Maybe or maybe not. After reading the CT scans, some members of Hawass’s group said the broken leg might have also happened when Tut was being embalmed. Others felt certain that Howard Carter’s team caused the break when they removed Tut’s body from its inner coffin years ago. It’s still possible that Tut was poisoned or that the broken leg happened during a failed attempt on his life. But if either of those theories is true, we may never find definite proof of it or who did it. With new scientific research and DNA evidence, theories of how the young king lived and died become more provable. But different experts might interpret them differently. What’s your interpretation?",1087.0
" The battle ended in a rout as the normally disciplined French soldiers threw down their arms and ran for their lives. With this humiliating defeat, the Napoleonic Wars—and the Napoleonic era—finally came to a close. Many French people were glad; they were sick of endless war and the heavy taxes that had been required to support it. In 1815, France’s monarchy was restored. Until 1871—except for one brief period—France would be ruled by kings and even another emperor: Napoleon’s nephew, Napoleon III. Napoleon I took no part in these events. He was exiled to the remote British island of St. Helena in the South Atlantic Ocean. He lived the remainder of his life there under constant guard, dictating his memoirs. He died in 1821. His body was later returned to France and buried in Paris.
Napoleon had a major influence on the later history of Europe. The ideas of his civil code spread the ideals of the French Revolution to many other nations, which based their legal structures on them. In this way, he swept away many musty traditions and opened the way for a new and more modern era of European politics. Napoleon’s legacy also included the concept of total war, where all parts of a nation devote themselves to supporting a war effort. His constant wars left an estimated six million people dead across Europe. Napoleon’s battle tactics and campaign strategies have since been studied at military schools around the world. Britain’s Duke of Wellington, who led the allied forces at Waterloo, was asked who he thought was the greatest general of all time. Without hesitation, he replied, “In this age, in past ages, in any age—Napoleon!”",1060.0
" The speech ends with the most famous part: “that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.” Here, Lincoln again uses repetition but with a difference. Rather than using synonyms, Lincoln varies one phrase with simple prepositions to remind his audience of what the government of the United States is all about: people.
Today, the handwritten copies of the Gettysburg Address are national treasures. The speech is also carved into the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., where visitors are inspired by it every day. Yet we’re not certain what the audience thought of his address on that day in 1863.
Their reaction to Lincoln’s speech was quiet. Some say there was delayed, scattered applause, barely enough to be polite. One newspaper’s editorial merely commented, “We pass over the silly remarks of the President. For the credit of the nation we are willing that the veil of oblivion shall be dropped over them and that they shall be no more repeated or thought of.” Others describe the scene as hushed with “a dignified silence.” Some historians say there was no applause because the audience was so impressed. After all, in just ten sentences, Lincoln had summarized the war and the spirit of a nation. Just as the battle’s significance emerged over time, so has posterity’s appreciation of Lincoln’s famous speech. People revere Lincoln’s speech today because he preserved a vision of a nation founded on and dedicated to equality. He rescued not just the war effort, but also the ideal that all those men died for. Americans have been inspired by that vision ever since.",1052.0
" It seeks human rights for all people, whatever their race, religion, income, or gender. However, the UN remains a controversial organization and has many critics. Some opponents complain that its operations cost too much and waste money. Others point to the Security Council’s failures to prevent war and genocide—the mass murder of civilians. Another complaint is that the UN plays favorites, overriding the best interests of some countries in favor of others. At the same time, the organization has done a lot of good in its more than seventy years. It provides food to more than ninety million people worldwide who might otherwise starve. It vaccinates over half the world’s children, helping prevent international epidemics. It provides a forum where leaders can talk through their differences rather than fight about them.
The news people hear about is usually bad news—war, violence, and other conflicts. However, in the big picture there has been a lot of good news to share since the UN was founded. For the first time ever, less than 10 percent of the world is living in extreme poverty, according to the World Bank. A Human Security Report study indicates that deaths from warfare have fallen steeply and fairly steadily since World War II. WHO reports that people’s average life span has increased, and fewer children die before age five. Many factors contribute to these positive changes, but the UN has been one of them. Humanity faces many challenges in the decades ahead—climate change and environmental concerns among them. There is no easy way to solve these and other problems once and for all.

" The higher up the mountain a person climbs, the more difficult it becomes to breathe. At 5,500 meters (18,000 ft), a climber is breathing only half of the normal amount of oxygen. Near the summit, breathing capacity drops to 30 percent of normal. A climber’s heart pounds and breathing is very difficult. Climbers must stop and rest even when putting on their boots. At high altitudes, the thin air blocks out fewer of the Sun’s harmful rays. Exposed skin can be severely sunburned, and without proper eye protection, the Sun can burn a climber’s eyes in a matter of minutes. Light reflecting off the white snow can cause a person to go temporarily blind. It is very important to wear eye protection, even during cloudy periods.
Winds on Mount Everest can blow at hurricane force, more than 161 kilometers per hour (100 mph). These frigid winds can freeze exposed skin in less than a minute. Frostbite is a serious danger, and some unfortunate climbers have had fingers, toes, and even their noses amputated. Dehydration is also a serious problem for climbers, so it is important to drink lots of water. Because of the low temperature, all water must be re-melted before climbers can drink it.
Climbing Mount Everest is not for the faint of heart. In fact, when you consider the danger posed by freezing temperatures, high winds, blinding snow, and lack of oxygen, to say nothing of avalanches, crevasses, and icy slopes, you wonder why anyone would do it. It is the thrill of adventure, the sense of accomplishment, and the feeling of being on top of the world that brings thousands of people to Mount Everest.",1057.0
" When these molds are added to the cheese, they cause chemical reactions that change the cheese’s flavor and make the cheese ripen. Other fungi help food in different ways.

Be a Mushroom Hunter!
What do you think would be a fun way to learn more about fungi? How about if you go out and try to find them? You might spot some mold or mildew here or there, but you’ll probably have the most fun if you try “hunting” for mushrooms. But remember not to put any mushrooms in your mouth and to wash your hands after handling fungi! Although it is safe to eat some kinds of mushrooms, other kinds contain poisons that can make you very sick! It is difficult to tell the poisonous kinds from the nonpoisonous kinds—unless you are a very experienced mushroom hunter. In fact, you should always go with an experienced mushroom hunter. Fall and spring, after heavy rains, are the best times to look for mushrooms. Before you start your hunt, you may want to go to the library or search the Internet to find out more about the mushrooms that grow in your area. The mushrooms listed at the end of the book are meant to give you an idea of some of the many kinds of fungi in North America.

" A shaman is a physical and spiritual healer who is thought to have the capability of traveling to and from the spirit world for medicine.
When scientists examined Otzi’s body, they found a large number of mysterious tattoos. The tattoos included stripes, a cross, and small bars. These weren’t decorations meant for others to see, for they appeared only on parts of his body that would have been hidden by clothing. Were these 57 crudely carved tattoos found on the Iceman’s ankles, knees, and calves an ancient form of acupuncture? They were located on, or near, acupuncture points that would be used to treat ailments that Otzi likely suffered from—arthritis and back pain.
Do You Know?
A small depression was found in Otzi’s right earlobe. Did this mean that he wore an earring?
Some scientists think that Otzi may have worn jewelry, too. When his body was found, a leather string with a fringe, strung through the two-inch disk made of white stone lay nearby. Could this mysterious object have been worn by a medicine man, like Otzi, as a necklace?
Near Otzi’s body, researchers also found two mushrooms on a piece of leather. Scientists know that this kind of mushroom can be used to fight sickness. Was Otzi carrying them as medicine— something the hunters needed? Was the Iceman really a shaman?
These are just a few of the scientific theories about the Iceman. They change when the facts— the clues—change. But sometimes the clues remain the same and the scientists reinterpret the facts differently. How do you interpret the facts?

" In the years after the Shah’s death, it was practically abandoned. Thieves took many of the gems and semiprecious stones. Gold lamps, Persian carpets, and other decorations disappeared.
By the late nineteenth century, the British had replaced the Mughals as India’s rulers. They began restoration of the Taj Mahal. Neat lawns replaced the overgrown gardens. The British repaired damaged marble and replaced missing screens and lamps.
Since the nineteenth century, new enemies have threatened the Taj Mahal. Air pollution from iron foundries, factories, and other industries damages the marble’s soft surface. A yellow fungus known as “marble cancer” causes additional damage and discoloration. Increasing numbers of visitors also place more wear and tear on the monument.
The Indian government has put a number of measures in place to protect the monument. Today, a 2-kilometer (1.2 mi.) traffic-free zone surrounds the Taj Mahal to keep out polluting vehicles. Polluting industries have been banned from a larger protected zone surrounding the monument. In addition, public and private groups are working together to repair and restore the Taj Mahal’s structures.
The Taj Mahal may face challenges, but it has already survived earthquakes, lightning, wars, and floods. With a bit of luck and a lot of hard work, it will survive the coming centuries as well.
Today, the Taj Mahal sees thousands of daily visitors—millions each year—from all over the world. The United Nations declared the Taj Mahal a World Heritage Site. An international vote established it as one of the New Seven Wonders of the World.

" Few of these are breeding females—possibly as few as 350. The conservation status of dragons is “vulnerable,” which means at risk of becoming endangered. Competition with humans and wild dogs for food is a threat to the survival of Komodo dragons. In addition, dragons are losing their habitat to humans, and villagers may kill dragons that attack livestock. Laws protect dragons in Indonesia, and international law prohibits their sale or trade. Still, poachers sometimes kill them. Scientists in many places are working to keep Komodo dragons from becoming extinct. Indonesia established Komodo National Park in 1980 to protect these rare reptiles. Dr. Jessop, an Australian, along with scientists from Italy and Indonesia, established the Komodo Survival Program in 2007 to study wild dragons and devise ways to manage and conserve them and their natural habitat. Scientists in zoos in Europe, Indonesia, Canada, and the United States work to maintain a genetically diverse population of captive dragons.
Komodo dragons are remarkable, super-sized reptiles and the largest lizards in the world. If you see one in a zoo or even in a video, you can’t help but marvel at the way these giants are perfectly designed for the life they lead. They carry around the tools of their trade at all times, especially their razor-sharp teeth and long, strong claws. Watching a dragon move around, it’s not hard to imagine the damage it can do when it’s on the prowl for a meal or a mate. Komodo dragons are an important part of Earth’s biodiversity. Dr. Jessop encourages people to do everything they can to help these amazing creatures as well as other wild animals. Supporting conservation groups and seeking ways to find a balance between people’s needs and the needs of other living things can help these enormous lizards survive.",1184.0
" Today, ostrich plumes are not used nearly as much.
Ostriches can live separately or in herds of five to fifty or more birds. While they prefer to stay by themselves, ostriches may peacefully hang out and share grasslands near other grazing animals such as zebras and antelopes. The other animals benefit from the ostrich, which makes loud noises to warn when danger is near. Ostrich herds usually consist of one dominant adult male (the rooster), several females (the hens), and ostrich chicks. The male ostrich courts several females and chooses which ones can and cannot become members of the herd. Once his herd is established, the male ostrich digs a shallow indentation in the ground—his herd’s nest. The dominant female lays approximately six eggs in the nest. The eggs are the largest of any bird, weighing about 3 pounds each (1.4 kg). This number one hen allows other hens to share the nest, but her eggs are kept safest in the center. Egg-sitting duty is shared, with the dominant male taking the night shift and the dominant female working the day shift.
After about forty-two days, an ostrich chick hatches. The ostrich babies are the size of adult chickens and begin to run almost immediately after hatching. The male teaches the chicks how to survive in the wilderness. With any luck, an ostrich may live to age fifty or older.
Ostriches are grand, mysterious birds. They are fast-paced, skilled runners that stand up to predators. They have adapted to a hostile and dangerous environment without the ability to fly. For many reasons, scientists continue to be fascinated with this swift and flightless creature. Studies will continue to discover what makes the ostrich unique, and what traits this feathery mammoth could possibly have shared with the Tyrannosaurus rex millions of years ago.",1072.0
" According to other records, an elite division of Ramses’s army, called the Ne’arin, arrived just in time to save the pharaoh. After heavy losses on both sides, though, the two leaders declared a truce. Ramses withdrew his forces back to Egypt. Over the following year, Ramses commissioned many poems and wall carvings to tell the story of the battle. All of them described him as a hero. According to some experts, he’d begun history’s first propaganda campaign. Fifteen years later, the two nations were again on the verge of war, but fighting so far from Ramses’s base was difficult. Instead of fighting each other, Ramses II and the Hittite king united to create a peace treaty. It included clauses still used in modern peace treaties, such as an agreement not to attack one another’s territories. It also ensured that the two nations would be allies for years to come. A copy of this treaty now hangs on the wall of the United Nations General Assembly building.
Ramses II ruled until 1213 before dying of natural causes at the age of ninety-one. He outlived his oldest son and original heir as well as the next eleven sons in line for the throne. His thirteenth son became pharaoh after him, but the dynasty soon began to decline. One hundred fifty years after Ramses’s death, the New Kingdom came to an end. Ramses II was so famous in ancient Egypt that at least nine later pharaohs were named after him. Today, Ramses II is known as Ramses the Great. He built more monuments and temples than any other pharaoh in history. As a result, he left behind a legacy of art, architecture, and historical records that allows us to better understand the people and culture of his time.",1010.0

Cold-Water and Drift Diving—Ocean waters off the coast of California are cold, and to stay warm divers must wear thick wet suits or dry suits. Dry suits keep out all water, and many divers prefer them for cold-water or ice diving. Diving the Channel Islands also requires knowing how to drift dive. Drift diving involves letting ocean currents carry divers from one place to another. A chase boat follows to pick them up at the end of the dive. Divers can see the undersea kelp forests that are habitats for diverse marine wildlife around the Channel Islands. Creatures range from lobsters to bat rays to sea lions to otters.
Why Dive?
Diving into a lake or ocean is like plunging into another world. Below the surface live life-forms unlike any on land. Scuba divers are privileged to see this beautiful, alien environment up close. Diving is also unlike any other sport. Divers often describe gliding underwater as an awesome experience, like being able to hover and fly. Scuba is a fun skill to learn, and with training and good judgment it is very safe as well as thrilling. It is an adventurous way to explore places few people ever have a chance to visit. The maximum depth that advanced recreational divers are allowed to dive is 30.5 meters (100 ft.). To avoid getting the bends, divers are trained to ascend no faster than 9 meters (30 ft.) per minute. If a diver is 30.5 meters (100 ft.) underwater, how long should it take for him or her to ascend to the surface?",1004.0
" Betrayed by men he thought were his supporters, Richard was killed while fighting desperately on foot after losing his horse. His crown was picked up from where it had fallen, and Henry Tudor was crowned king of England on the battlefield, becoming King Henry VII. Years later, in 1534, Henry’s son, Henry VIII, broke with the Catholic Church and dissolved the monasteries. This act led to the destruction and loss of Greyfriars Priory, where, centuries later, Richard’s skeleton was uncovered.
The rest of the story is not so clear. After Henry VII took the throne, rumors raged about Richard and what might have happened to the two young princes in the Tower. Maybe Richard III ordered their murder. Maybe they lived for the two years Richard reigned as king, but were later killed by the new king, Henry VII, who had killed Richard. Maybe they were smuggled out of the country to safety. Today, fans of Richard III believe that the discovery of his skeleton may cause people to change their opinions about this medieval king. They believe he had strong sympathy for the rights of the common people and that he established many principles of modern law. These include the ideas that defendants must be considered innocent until proven guilty, that defendants have a right to bail, and that all laws must be known and published. What becomes of Richard now could change how his history is told.

" For the other fifty weeks of the year, those groves are terrible habitat for bees—there’s nothing to eat. Transport isn’t great for the bees, either. Millions of bees die from the stress each year, and once they’re on the road, the bees don’t have access to natural food sources. What beekeepers feed them instead, some scientists liken to junk food. Bringing in bees from different parts of the country (or the world) also spreads pests at a rapid rate. This is just one more piece of the complex puzzle of CCD.
Because of the complexity of CCD, scientists have yet to find an undeniable cause or cure for the disorder. However, there is still hope for honeybees. By making a few changes, humans can begin to create honeybee-friendly environments. One thing honeybees need is diversity; lots of different wildflowers means lots of forage. To answer this need, honeybee sanctuaries full of blooming plants are springing up. In these places, bees can escape pesticides and find plenty to eat.
A movement of rooftop and backyard beekeepers is growing, too. For a long time, it was illegal to keep bees in New York City, but that ban was overturned in 2010. Cities such as Seattle, Chicago, and San Francisco have also made it legal to keep bees. These beekeepers keep fewer hives and don’t truck them around. People who don’t keep bees can plant blooming plants. Even monoculture farmers can take a small portion of their land and grow plants that would sustain bees all year long, not just for a couple of weeks each year. They might also use different pesticides, or none at all. We all can make choices that help the honeybee. After all, the honeybee helps us every day.",1010.0

The U.S. government also gives grants (awards of money) to scientists to help them study “renewable” ways of producing energy. Most renewable energy sources do not use fossil fuels or emit greenhouse gases. They are called renewable, because—unlike fossil fuels— their supplies will not eventually run out. Renewable energy sources include hydropower and geothermal, wind, and solar power. Hydropower uses moving water, such as a river, to produce energy. Geothermal power uses hot water or steam from inside the ground. Wind power uses moving air. Solar power uses sunlight. Nuclear power is another way to produce energy that does not emit greenhouse gases. However, nuclear power produces dangerous wastes. Besides cutting emissions of greenhouse gases, we can also remove some greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. The best way to do this is by planting more trees.

" Fences block migrating range animals from following centuries-old trails that lead to important feeding grounds.
Even well-intentioned structures harm migrators. The huge blades of giant wind turbines used to generate clean electricity are deadly to migrating birds and bats. Large-scale solar farms, such as the Ivanpah solar plant in California’s Mojave Desert, are responsible for killing thousands of birds that fly into the concentrated beams of sunlight and are instantly burned to death. To address these problems, researchers use tracking devices to monitor migratory animals. They include the information in studies showing the impact of construction on the environment in hopes that new construction can be placed away from migration corridors. New awareness of migration routes and the behavior of migrators has inspired people to find ways to help rather than hurt them.
Some regions now have wildlife overpasses and underpasses where roadways and land migration routes cross. These wildlife-only bridges and tunnels help keep migrators and drivers away from each other and safe. Engineers are working to improve clean-energy devices that unintentionally harm migrators. Vertical wind turbines in development may one day replace the giant horizontal propellers on wind farms. Specially constructed “fish ladders” have been placed next to dams on salmon migration routes so that the fish can safely reach their spawning grounds. Information about how pollution affects migrators already stressed from their long journeys could lead to regulations designed to keep migrators safe. What’s most impressive about amazing migrators is how, despite these obstacles, they set out on their epic journeys year after year. These migrations across land, in the air, and through the sea are critical to the survival of these species. Understanding their importance can inspire us to take action to ensure that these important journeys continue for many years to come.",1261.0
" A small figurine is also baked inside the pastry, which comes with a cardboard crown. If you find the figurine in your portion, then you are crowned king or queen for the day. Another popular holiday is Bastille Day, which is held on July 14 and honors the day that the French Revolution began. On that day in 1789, French citizens stormed the Bastille, a prison in Paris, setting the prisoners free and taking control of the building. Today, French people celebrate their freedom with parades, speeches, and fireworks.
France is famous for its food and cooking styles, and many French people consider good food one of life’s greatest pleasures. One type of French cooking that has become popular around the world is called haute cuisine (OHT kwih-ZEEN) which means “high cooking.” Meals cooked in this way usually include rich dishes made with butter, cream, eggs, and spices. Many French people also cook delicious, low-fat meals that use fresh ingredients. French people can buy meat at a butcher, or boucherie (boosh-REE). At a bakery, or boulangerie (boo-LAHN-zhuh-REE), people can buy bread baked in long thin loaves called baguettes. For dessert, the French sometimes eat crepes, which are very thin pancakes, and tarts, or small pies made with fruit or eggs.
France is a modern country with a long and fascinating history. The ancestry of its people reflects a history of invasions and warfare. Today, many of its people enjoy lives filled with good food, art, and other leisurely pursuits. France has become a country known throughout the world for its architecture, art, food, and culture. Beautiful cities, villages, castles, and vineyards dot its rolling hills, plains, and mountains. With its landmarks and rich history, it is no wonder France is the most visited country in the world.",965.0
" Athletes often begin their training at an early age as coaches help them develop their natural abilities. Athletes who want to compete in the Olympics devote a great deal of time to honing their skills. Many countries maintain special Olympic training centers to support athletes while they train. Olympic competition is so strong that some athletes cheat. They think they need even more of an edge than nature and training can provide. In recent years, some Olympic athletes, often with the help of team trainers or doctors, have secretly used performance-enhancing drugs to win. The use of prohibited substances by these athletes has tarnished the image and reputation of the Olympics.
Since the mid-1970s, Olympic officials have routinely tested athletes for drug use. Olympic champions who fail a drug test can be stripped of their medals. For example, Marion Jones, the great American track star, had to return the five medals she won in the 2000 Summer Olympics because she admitted to using steroids to run faster. Controversies have also arisen concerning judges of figure-skating and diving competitions. Some judges may have awarded undeserved points to athletes from their own countries or agreed to trade points with other judges.
Olympic organizers work hard to keep the Games honest and fair for everyone. The Olympics continue to grow bigger and more popular each time they are held. Each Olympics includes the world’s best athletes, a new host country, and often some amazing surprises. Few Olympics pass without world records being broken. The modern Olympic Games encompass centuries of history and provide an opportunity for breathtaking individual and team efforts. Like the ancient Olympics, the modern Games continue to represent the ideal of sportsmanship and peaceful competition among nations.",1112.0
" When the ghost ship was found the next day, the second crew had disappeared as well.
In 1966, Captain Donald Henry’s tug, the Good News , was towing a cargo barge from Puerto Rico to Florida. When a dense fog suddenly swirled around the barge, the Good News lost the use of all of its instruments and partially lost power. For five minutes, the Good News struggled in a tug-of-war with the fog bank; it finally managed to pull itself and the barge free. People claim that a mysterious power causes the many losses of ships and crews in the Bermuda Triangle. Because weird lights are seen there, some think that UFOs capture humans and take them away.
Others say the unexplained losses are a result of the severe weather common in the area. Hurricanes and violent waterspouts blow up suddenly, and tidal waves are common. Any vessel that is destroyed would wash away without a trace. Some of the missing crews, when rescued later, tell stories of being forced to leave their storm-damaged ships. Some say that nothing unusual is going on in the area. They suggest that some of the losses blamed on the Bermuda Triangle actually happened hundreds of miles away. Other vessels that have been reported lost actually showed up later. Do you think the Bermuda Triangle is real or a hoax?
Mysterious occurrences—things we can’t understand—will always exist. Some people will think they are nonsense, and others will claim they are real. Now that you’ve read evidence here about four of them, it’s time to consider what you’ve read and determine what you believe. You can use the Internet and the library to find more information. What do you think about these mysteries, and what others can you find?",1017.0
" It was renamed the Elizabeth Tower in 2012 to celebrate Queen Elizabeth II’s sixtieth anniversary as queen of England. The tower tilts to one side because of some digging that was carried out in a nearby street, but fortunately it isn’t in danger of falling.
Big Ben has become one of the best-known landmarks in the United Kingdom, with millions of visitors seeing it each year. The Elizabeth Tower is one of the most photographed sights in London and has appeared in many movies. Citizens of the United Kingdom can make appointments to tour the tower. Once there, visitors make a difficult 334-step climb to the top. There were no elevators when the tower was built. From 62 meters (203 ft.) above the ground, guests enjoy a spectacular view of London, explore the behind-the-scenes tour of the giant clocks and their mechanisms, and get a close-up view of Big Ben itself. People from around the world are welcome to visit the Houses of Parliament. They can take a tour, watch debates, and even have afternoon tea there.
Indestructible?
The world over, Big Ben and the Palace of Westminster are among the most recognizable symbols of Britain. The structure has housed monarchs and politicians and withstood destructive fires and intense bombing, yet it proudly stands today as a national monument. United Kingdom residents and visitors are familiar with the chiming of Big Ben’s bell. It is broadcast live on some TV channels at midnight every New Year’s Eve, and the entire country stops to observe two minutes of silence each year on November 11, when Big Ben rings at 11:00 a.m. in remembrance of those who have lost their lives in wars. Every quarter of an hour, Big Ben reminds us of its presence. Perhaps it always will.",1076.0
"
The SS Edmund Fitzgerald was a huge freighter. On November 9, 1975, the ship left Superior, Wisconsin, fully loaded with iron ore and captained by Ernest McSorley. A storm was forecast, but the veteran captain was not concerned. On the afternoon of November 10, though, the U.S. Coast Guard warned all ships to seek shelter. The Edmund Fitzgerald headed for Whitefish Bay, Wisconsin. At about 7:00 p.m., McSorley reported that the ship was taking on water but radioed, “We are holding our own.”
Moments later, the ship was gone. It no longer appeared on radar. No lifeboats were launched. None of the twenty-nine crew members were found. The Coast Guard located the wreck on the lake floor within days. The ship had been snapped in half. Investigators suspect a series of three rogue waves may have sunk the ship so suddenly there was no time even to make a distress call.
Sailing the seas has always been a great adventure, one that has inspired thousands of novels and movies. Part of any true adventure, though, is the element of danger—and the sea has plenty of it. The oceans stretch vast distances, weather can turn suddenly savage, and threatening reefs and rocks hide along coastlines. Modern equipment makes shipping safer than ever, but dozens of shipwrecks still claim the lives of about two thousand people every year. Working on a ship remains one of the world’s most dangerous jobs. Sailors entrust their lives to their knowledge, skills, and the ships they serve on—but sometimes, they are left to depend on only their luck. Every shipwreck leaves behind mysteries. Some of these mysteries can be explored and eventually explained, and older wrecks may provide us with a glimpse into the past. Much of the time, though, the sea keeps these secrets to itself.",951.0
" The speech ends with the most famous part: “that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.” Here, Lincoln again uses repetition but this time with a difference. Rather than using synonyms, Lincoln varies one phrase with simple prepositions to remind his audience that the government of the United States is all about people.
Today, the handwritten copies of the Gettysburg Address are national treasures. The speech is carved into the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., where visitors are inspired by it every day. Yet we’re not certain what the audience thought of his address on that day in 1863.
Their reaction to Lincoln’s speech was quiet. Some say there was delayed, scattered applause, barely enough to be polite. One newspaper’s editorial negatively commented, “We pass over the silly remarks of the President. For the credit of the nation we are willing that the veil of oblivion shall be dropped over them and that they shall be no more repeated or thought of.” Others describe the scene as hushed with “a dignified silence.” Some historians say there was no applause because the audience was so impressed by the president’s words. After all, in just ten sentences, he had summarized the war and the spirit of a nation. Just as the battle’s significance emerged over time, so has appreciation of Lincoln’s speech. People revere Lincoln’s speech today because he preserved a vision of a nation founded on and dedicated to equality. He rescued not just the war effort, but also the ideal that all those men died for. Americans have been inspired by that vision ever since.",1047.0
" When Sigurd returned home, many of his Northmen remained behind and entered the Emperor’s body-guard, and my ancestor, a Norwegian born, stayed behind, too, with the ships that Sigurd gave the Emperor. Seafarers we have ever been, and no wonder; as for me, the city of my birth is no more my home than any pleasant port between there and the London River. I know them all, and they know me. Set me down on any of their quays or foreshores, and I am home again.”
“I suppose you go on great voyages,” said the Water Rat with growing interest. “Months and months out of sight of land, and provisions running short, and allowanced as to water, and your mind communing with the mighty ocean, and all that sort of thing?” “By no means,” said the Sea Rat frankly. “Such a life as you describe would not suit me at all. I’m in the coasting trade, and rarely out of sight of land. It’s the jolly times on shore that appeal to me, as much as any seafaring. O, those southern seaports! The smell of them, the riding lights at night, the glamour!” “Well, perhaps you have chosen the better way,” said the Water Rat, but rather doubtfully. “Tell me something of your coasting, then, if you have a mind to, and what sort of harvest an animal of spirit might hope to bring home from it to warm his latter days with gallant memories by the fireside; for my life, I confess to you, feels to me today somewhat narrow and circumscribed.”",930.0
" In return, he asked Alexander to battle Taxiles’s enemy Porus, who ruled nearby Indian lands. Alexander would need to subdue him in order to continue his march east. In June, Alexander and his troops arrived at the Hydaspes (hy-DAS-peez) River to fight Porus and his army. It is not clear whether Alexander used elephants in the fight. We do know that Porus’s elephants, having done damage to the Greeks, eventually panicked due to the intensity of the fight and retreated. Porus surrendered to Alexander. It was Alexander’s last big battle. Despite Alexander’s efforts to convince his followers to go farther east, there was mutiny among the weary troops. They convinced Alexander to return home. Alexander made it to Babylon before he came down with a fever. In June 323, Alexander the Great died.
Alexander the Great reigned for twelve years and eight months. He was thirty-three years old when he died. He never lost a battle. Alexander was brutal at times; the estimated number of people his armies killed is close to 750,000. Still, he is considered an excellent leader and military commander. Unifying his followers by sharing his vision and leading in war with superb understanding of battle, Alexander took back the Greek cities that Persia ruled. Furthermore, he extended his empire to Egypt and a large portion of central Asia, areas that had never been explored by Europeans. Alexander became a model for generations of military leaders who followed. He opened doors of knowledge in his explorations, learning about new religion and government. He also introduced the people he encountered to Greek culture and created a world that was more open to trade of new materials and, more importantly, new ideas.",970.0
" As always, Washington held firm in his views, but he felt the heat of disapproval from a public that had long adored him. Setting a precedent that almost all future presidents would follow until it became law in 1951, Washington ended his presidency after two terms.
Before leaving the office of president, Washington had one final message for the American people. In his Farewell Address, he spoke about issues he felt would impact the nation for years to come. Washington warned against making alliances with European nations that could draw the nation into future conflicts. He also cautioned—perhaps surprisingly, for a military man—that having too large an army could become “particularly hostile to republican liberty.” Washington retired to his beloved Mount Vernon in early 1797, where he resumed his passion for farming. On December 12, 1799, Washington complained of a sore throat and took to his bed, exhausted. Doctors treated him but to no avail. He died two days later at the age of sixty-seven.
The impact of George Washington’s life and presidency is still felt today. Not only was he America’s first president—setting numerous important precedents—but his personal character set the tone for how the world expected the American president to be, both stylistically and temperamentally. Many of the attributes he developed as a military officer, including courage, confidence, discipline, and an active, take-charge energy, served him well as president. Many presidents who followed have aspired to demonstrate those qualities in their own administrations. Military officer and Congressman Henry Lee, one of Washington’s contemporaries, characterized him as “first in war, first in peace, first in the hearts of his countrymen.” People admired Washington in his day, just as people admire him to this day. George Washington was truly the Father of His Country.",1134.0
" Although Elizabeth never publicly announced who would succeed her, she did so privately; there was no dispute over her choice. James VI, Elizabeth’s closest living relative and son of Mary, Queen of Scots, would be king. Mary and James were direct descendants of Henry VII, the first Tudor king. After Elizabeth died, James took the throne and became James I of England. The new Protestant king’s succession was peaceful, and by her action, Elizabeth finally brought together the thrones of England and Scotland. In 1707, the two countries united, ending one of the more bitter rivalries between two European countries. Elizabeth left James a strong government and a powerful navy. She had encouraged trade with foreign countries and funded the exploration of the New World. England was set to become a global empire and the Elizabethan Age came to be known as the “Golden Age” of England.
One of Elizabeth’s greatest accomplishments was to reduce the religious strife that had torn England apart. Under her rule, Protestantism was established as the official religion of England. During Elizabeth’s reign, women, too, experienced a new level of freedom. Elizabeth helped to foster the idea that women, as well as men, could do anything they wanted to do. She loved her country and proved to her enemies and allies alike that a woman—as much as a man—could be an intelligent, effective, and successful leader. Elizabeth was considered a giant among monarchs and one of the most popular and best- known female rulers in history. She was praised for her strong leadership and held in high regard for her support of the arts. Historically, she was also one of the most beloved and compelling personalities to ascend the English throne.",1066.0
" Australians speak English, and they pay for purchases with Australian dollars. Much of Australian culture comes from Britain. Australians still honor the queen of Britain as their ceremonial head of state. In 1999, Australians voted to keep this loyalty to Britain. In 2003, approximately 20 million people lived in Australia. Of all Australians, about 92 percent are Caucasian, or white, and 7 percent are Asian. Today, 350,000 Aboriginal people live in Australia. Almost every single Australian adult can read!
About 90 percent of Australians live in cities. Australian cities are modern, but they are long distances from each other. Australia’s capital city is Canberra, which is within New South Wales. Although it is the center of politics and government, it has some small-town charms. There are only around 500,000 residents. The city has art museums, the High Court of Australia, the Australian National University, and other important places.
Sydney is Australia’s largest city, with a population above four million. Within the city lie a business district, Chinatown, The Botanic Gardens, museums and art galleries, and many old buildings. Surrounding the city are national parks filled with plants and animals. Sydney is also home to some of the most beautiful beaches in the world. Australia’s other big cities include Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, and Adelaide. Like almost all of Australia’s cities, these are right along the coast.

" Galileo also released a small probe that parachuted into Jupiter’s atmosphere. This probe had instruments that measured wind speed and the amounts of different chemicals in the atmosphere.
Jupiter looks like a bright star that you can see in the southern part of the sky only at certain times of the year. To know exactly where and when to look for Jupiter, check the weather or astronomy section in your local newspaper. You can also check an astronomy magazine or website. If you look at Jupiter with binoculars, you will be able to see the planet’s four largest moons and watch them change their position around Jupiter from one night to the next. With a telescope of medium power, you can see the belts and zones on Jupiter as well as the Great Red Spot, which also all change from night to night. It’s fun to sketch what you see, but if you have a certain kind of telescope, you can use a camera to take photos instead.
What’s Next for Jupiter?
Jupiter is an exciting planet because it’s a big ball of surprises. Scientists are always learning new things about this enormous planet, and you never know what they might discover next. Scientists are working on many new plans to learn more about Jupiter and its moons. According to one of these plans, the United States and Europe would send a spacecraft to land on Jupiter’s moon Europa. This craft would then melt through the moon’s icy surface to study the ocean that scientists think might exist inside Europa, leading to the possible discovery of ocean life on this moon. There’s a lot to look forward to with Jupiter. Perhaps someday you will be able to discover an amazing new fact about this surprising giant in the sky!",1125.0

After leaving Yentna Station, the mushers race back to the starting point of the race over the same trail they followed to get there. They go through each of the same checkpoints they stopped at on the way to Yentna Station.

" Its antlers can weigh as much as a typical 11-year-old child, and those antlers can grow up to 25 millimeters (1 in.) a day!
Deer, including elk, moose, and caribou, are herbivores. Some are grazers (eating mostly grass), but most are browsers (eating leaves, shoots, twigs, and other plant parts). Deer are found in many habitats around the world, including grasslands, forests, rainforests, and tundra. Many deer migrate with the changing seasons to locate food.
Most male deer grow antlers, which are made of bone and covered in furry skin called velvet while they are growing. Antlers grow before the mating season, fall off after it, and grow again the following year. Caribou are the only kind of deer in which the females have antlers.
Cattle, sheep, goats, and antelopes vary widely in shape and coloring; however, they all share the feature of growing permanent horns made of bone and covered with a layer of keratin. All the males of this group and some females have horns; each horn is always a single spike. The horns can be simple, curved, or spiral in shape, and antelopes often have horns that are elaborately shaped. Many domesticated animals in this group are kept for milk, meat, and wool.
Ungulates are diverse creatures, each with a unique body and lifestyle that make it perfectly suited to the habitat in which it lives. Many ungulates, such as swine, sheep, and cattle, are raised in great numbers for food, milk, and hides. But many wild ungulates, such as the rhino, are endangered and survive only in captivity. Others are at risk of suffering the same fate because of environmental destruction, hunting, and other threats to their well-being. Habitat preservation and respect for life will allow these amazing animals to continue to survive into the future.",1043.0
" When an outbreak reaches this size, it is known as a pandemic —a disease that spreads rapidly around the world.
But the pandemic of 1918 was not the only major influenza outbreak in history. The Asian flu, which appeared in 1957, caused about 70,000 deaths in the United States. It got its name because it first appeared in China before coming to the United States in June 1957. Another strain of flu, the Hong Kong flu, was first detected in Hong Kong, China. In 1968, this virus caused another pandemic, resulting in 34,000 deaths in just the United States—as many people as live in a small city. And in 2009, the H1N1 swine flu became the first pandemic in 41 years, infecting people in over 70 countries.
Other outbreaks have caused widespread concern without developing into pandemics. These include the Russian flu in 1977 and the avian flu in 1997 and 1999. Both of these strains of flu began in regions of China and spread to other countries. Doctors are always on the lookout for the next major outbreak. They believe that if they can detect outbreaks quickly enough, they can keep them from becoming worldwide pandemics.
Because flu viruses can change and develop into new strains, influenza may never be eradicated. When you have the flu, the most important thing to do is take care of yourself and prevent others from getting sick. Keep your germs to yourself by staying away from other people and covering your nose and mouth when you cough or sneeze. Drink water like a thirsty camel and sleep like a hibernating bear. Getting a flu vaccine each year can also help. Most importantly, remember to attack back! Good food and rest will help the healthy cells in your body win the battle.",1031.0

" By the 1880s, cameras were becoming more portable. Photographs became more candid. Just as a photograph could capture a spontaneous moment, painters attempted to do the same. Their subjects might be simple moments in daily life, such as people waiting for a train or relaxing in a park.
In addition, by using cameras, artists learned to frame scenes in interesting ways. This technique is called cropping. In photography, an artist could cut away the edges to better frame the subject. The Impressionists understood this technique and used it to compose their own works. Works by the Impressionists show a strong influence from photography. In Renoir’s The Umbrellas (1881–1886), a group of people with umbrellas walk down a street on a rainy day. Many figures are cut off by the edge of the canvas. There is not one focal point in the center, but rather the viewer’s eye darts between different places, including the woman on the left and the girl on the right who both look out of the canvas.
Impressionism was an influential movement in the history of art. When the Impressionists started painting, their art wasn’t taken seriously. They were rejected by the Salon and had difficulty gaining acceptance. By moving away from traditional realistic art styles, they were able to pursue new ideas. They focused on capturing fleeting moments, working en plein air, and using certain photographic techniques while maintaining their own distinct style. Today, works by Monet, Degas, and other Impressionists sell for millions of dollars. They are considered masterpieces and are displayed in art museums around the world. By breaking the rules of traditional art, the Impressionists paved the way for other art movements. Thanks to their work, artists continue to experiment and make us question our ideas about art.",1014.0
" The initial trick-or-treaters in the 1930s and 1940s received cookies and fruit as well as toys and even pocket change.
Candy became a popular offering as trick-or-treating became more widespread in the 1950s. However, the tiny, individually wrapped Halloween candy bars common today didn’t appear until the 1970s. Although the treats have changed over the years, kids’ enthusiasm hasn’t. In the United States alone, more than 41 million children between the ages of five and fourteen went trick-or-treating in 2014.
Halloween’s popularity is on the rise. Especially in the United States and Canada, the number of people who celebrate Halloween each year is growing. Some cities are organizing community trick-or-treating events at malls, churches, and community centers. These events help kids pile up lots of candy in a short amount of time, and they also help to keep trick-or-treaters safe from street traffic. The crowds aren’t made up of kids alone; adults are celebrating Halloween in increasing numbers, too. In 2015, consumers actually planned to spend more on costumes for adults than on costumes for children. Many adults (especially young adults) participate in the festivities by hosting or attending Halloween parties as well as dressing in costume. Halloween is fun for kids—but adults definitely don’t want to be left out.
Halloween today looks very different from the Halloween celebrations of the 1950s, the 1800s, and the Samhain festival of the ancient Celts; its traditions continue to change, mixing the old with the new. From bonfires to chocolate bars, from coal-filled turnips to candle-lit pumpkins, Halloween is a holiday that changes with the times, providing fun and entertainment for one spooky night each year. Today, Halloween is rich with traditions from several different cultures that people of all ages can enjoy.",1155.0
" In June 1778, after that horrible winter, Washington attacked the British army, now under the command of General Henry Clinton, at the Battle of Monmouth. Neither side won the fight, which was the last major battle in the northern colonies.
British forces captured Savannah, Georgia, in December 1778. Then they attacked and captured Charleston, South Carolina, in May 1780. They won yet again at Camden, South Carolina, in August 1780. Many colonists in the southern colonies were Loyalists. Although Britain was winning the South, the Patriots would not give up.
The tide of the war started to turn in favor of the Patriots in October when they won a battle at King’s Mountain, South Carolina, in a speedy sixty-five minutes. They again won battles at Camden and Cowpens. Next, they forced British General Charles Cornwallis north into Virginia. Cornwallis had aided the British victory at Long Island and had taken command of British troops in the South. The Patriots’ alliance with the French began to pay off. French soldiers helped hold the British back and fought alongside colonists as part of the troops Washington led into Virginia. The most important battle of the war was about to begin. French ships drove off the British ships sent to rescue Cornwallis at Yorktown, on the coast of Virginia. The French fleet also brought extra soldiers to help the fight on land. The French and Patriot troops moved into Yorktown, surrounding the British army. The British fought for three weeks before surrendering on October 19, 1781. The Revolutionary War was over. The Patriots had won their war and were now independent from Britain. Now a group of colonies that was used to being supported by another country had to come together and build a brand new nation.",974.0
" He remained dedicated to his work and his ideas, yet he never achieved the sort of breakthroughs he’d had during the “miracle year” or with his General Theory of Relativity. Always in demand, he continued to give speeches, write articles, and meet regularly with fellow scientists.
Einstein was not an inventor, yet his curiosity led to the creation of many useful products. For example, Einstein’s ideas about the nature and behavior of light led scientists to develop new ways to control light, and these new technologies eventually led to the production of television cameras, remote controls for home electronics, and flat-screen computers. Einstein was also the first person to think of laser light, a technology that is now used in compact discs (CDs), digital video discs (DVDs), and supermarket checkout equipment. His proof of the existence of atoms and molecules led to the creation or improvement of a wide range of products, including shaving cream, toothpaste, personal computers and cell phones.
Einstein’s scientific ideas continue to influence new theories and technologies. Current ideas about the origins of the universe, the nature of space and time, and strange, intriguing objects called black holes all owe a large debt to Einstein’s work and original thinking. Einstein’s discoveries and equations provided the foundation for scientists to comprehend many aspects of the universe. Scientists have only recently been able to test and confirm some of Einstein’s most interesting theories.
Einstein once said, “The most beautiful experience we can have is the mysterious. . . . It is enough to try to understand a little of this mystery every day.” Until his death on April 18, 1955, Einstein’s curiosity led him to work to understand nature’s greatest mysteries. In doing so, he changed the way people think about time, space, energy, and matter—the foundations of the universe.",1420.0
" If found on private lands, fossils belong to the landowner, who can keep the fossils or get rid of them as desired. This includes auctioning them off to the highest bidder, regardless of where they will end up. The laws about fossil collecting vary in other countries. In Germany, a professional paleontologist must inspect every fossil that is collected. Scientifically important finds become the property of the government, with the finder paid a fee. Unimportant finds are returned to the finder, who is free to keep or sell them. Some people involved with the paleontology debate consider Germany’s policy to be one that the United States should adopt. Others think it would be a mistake for the United States to follow Germany’s example. They believe such strict policies would be expensive and inconvenient to enforce and would violate the property rights of American citizens.
Imagine that you’re out on a nature hike and you come across a fossil. Should you pick it up and take it home? Report your find? Leave it alone? Children and adults are generally curious about the natural world, and picking up rocks, fossils, and other objects can be fun. These items reflect the history of our planet—its geological cycles as well as its diverse life forms, many of which are now extinct. According to the Black Hills Institute of Geological Research, more than four-fifths of all important fossils have been found by amateurs. The Dueling Dinosaurs aren’t the last amazing fossil discovery that will take place in your lifetime. Many others will no doubt be made, some by academic scientists, others by commercial fossil hunters, and still others by everyday citizens on nature outings. What will the fate of those fossils be?",1019.0
" These traits make it ideal for many medical uses. Researchers hope to use it to create artificial ligaments or nearly invisible stitches for eye surgery patients. Unfortunately, it takes fourteen thousand spiders to make one ounce of silk. Since spiders tend to eat their neighbors, large-scale “spider farms” are out of the question. Instead, scientists used genetic engineering techniques (directly manipulating an animal’s genes) to insert spider silk proteins into goat DNA. The goats then produce spider silk proteins in their milk, which is easy to collect. Someday, researchers hope to engineer goats that can produce commercially useful amounts of spider silk. Since spider genes were inserted into goat cells in a laboratory, “spider goats” are considered transgenic rather than hybrid animals.
Animal Hybrids: Problem or Solution?
In the past, scientists thought that animal hybrids represented an evolutionary dead end. Most hybrids were sterile, and even those that could reproduce usually carried a combination of their parents’ traits. The parents were probably well adapted to their specific environments; by combining their characteristics, the hybrid would end up adapted to neither. In most cases, this is exactly what we see in nature: hybrid species are usually poorly adapted to their environments and often fail to survive and reproduce. However, when a species faces drastic environmental changes, it may not be able to adapt to the new conditions quickly enough to survive. Hybrids provide a way for two species to exchange genetic information. A hybrid animal could potentially gain traits that would allow it to survive where one or both parents could not. Are hybrid animals a threat to the survival of at-risk species like polar bears? Or are they nature’s way of helping species cope with rapidly changing environmental conditions? They may be a bit of both—only time will tell!",1163.0
" Frazier threw in the towel. Both men were so beaten up that Ali later said, “We went to Manila as champions, and we came back as old men.” Ali kept his title for another two and a half years before he lost it to Leon Spinks, but he fought Spinks again a few months later and won, becoming the only boxer to win the heavyweight crown three times. Ali didn’t fight again for two years, and when he did, he lost the title for good to Larry Holmes. At thirty-eight, his long career in the ring came to an end.
After retiring from boxing, Ali traveled the world speaking up for human rights. In 1984, he was diagnosed with Parkinson’s, a disease that makes it hard for the brain to control the muscles. As his health declined, it became difficult for the usually eloquent Ali to speak. But in 1996, he returned to the Olympic Games, this time to light the Olympic flame in Atlanta. Ali clearly struggled to lift the torch, but as the crowd cheered he held the flame aloft, a fighter to the end. In 2016, Muhammad Ali died at age seventy-four. The once controversial champ had become universally beloved. President Obama praised his activism, saying “Ali stood his ground. And his victory helped us get used to the America we recognize today.” Ali wasn’t just the greatest boxer who ever lived—he also helped transform his country by fighting for what he believed in. As Ali once said, “I am America. I am the part you won’t recognize. But get used to me—black, confident, cocky; my name, not yours; my religion, not yours; my goals, my own. Get used to me.”",1006.0
" Newer debit and credit cards have microchip technology, called radio frequency identification (RFID) chips, embedded into the cards. These chips carry more personal information about the cardholder’s account than is on the magnetic strips. When the card is swiped through a card-reading machine, the machine electronically contacts the bank to verify that the account has enough money in it or enough available credit. If the money or credit is there, the money is taken from the person’s account and moved to the store’s, restaurant’s, or company’s account. It is easier to carry one piece of plastic than to carry many bills. Plus, since cards have the owner’s name and information on them, the money is harder to steal than bills are.
However, credit cards can be dangerous because people forget that they must pay back the money they borrowed. Many people who use credit cards irresponsibly owe so much money to the banks that the banks take back, or repossess, the things the person bought. If that happens, a negative note is made on the person’s credit history, and he or she may not be able to borrow again for a long time. Plastic cards are less visible than money, but they can buy the same goods. Our invisible money allows us to trade with people around the world. With the help of catalogs and the Internet, people can use credit cards to buy goods from a person or company in another country. The money is automatically changed into a currency the other person can use.
Three thousand years ago, people bartered to trade goods or services with each other. Today, people trade with each other using bills, coins, and even invisible money. What sort of money do you think we’ll have in another three thousand years?",1052.0
" As visitors explore, they may see archaeologists hard at work continuing the excavation and preservation of Teotihuacán. Only 5 percent of the city has been scientifically excavated so far. In 1987, Teotihuacán was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and today it is the most studied site in Mesoamerica.
The millions of visitors who hike to many ruins and archaeological zones in and around the city cause a lot of wear on the site. So do natural factors such as rain and wind. New developers are another destructive threat to the site. In 2004, one developer received permission to build on ground that was once part of the great city. By law, the company was bound to report any artifacts dug up during construction. It found artifacts but didn’t report them. Instead, the company used heavy machines to dig and threw away priceless artifacts to save time, resulting in years of legal battles.
In 2013, archaeologists sent a robot carrying a camera through a small tunnel to a chamber under the Temple of Quetzalcoatl to take pictures. The photos showed a chamber filled with hundreds of spheres covered with a mineral powder that gave them a golden glow. The whole chamber—the walls and ceiling—glowed like gold, too. Long ago, everything in the chamber would have appeared brilliant under torchlight. There were also masks covered with crystals and jade. Archaeologists were stumped as to the purpose of the golden chamber. As archaeologists explore the many tunnels under the pyramids, they continue to find new artifacts, including a collection of obsidian knives and carvings of coiled jaguars. Perhaps one day archaeologists will finally discover who lived and ruled in ancient Teotihuacán.",1086.0
" Dragon Ball Z is an example of shonen anime that first aired in Japan in 1989 and continues to be shown on television stations throughout the world. Shojo —manga made for girls—at first starred female characters with story lines that focused on emotions and relationships, but eventually evolved to include more dynamic heroines who are actively involved in romance and adventure. The 1990s anime series Sailor Moon by artist Naoko Takeuchi is a classic example of shojo anime. It tells the story of a middle-school girl who is empowered by a magical broach to become a guardian of Earth and protect it from evil forces.
In the 1980s and 1990s, Japanese studios produced anime films that went on to be international hits. In 1984, Hayao Miyazaki released Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind, which saw great success. It told the story of a young princess who must save her planet. In 2001, the Japanese anime Spirited Away brought the tale of a young girl who enters the spirit world to the big screen. The director, Hayao Miyazaki, received much praise for the film’s artistry, and it eventually won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature. Anime is featured in the latest twenty-first- century media, too. Today there are dozens of video games based on manga comics or anime shows and movies. The interactive nature of the games is a thrill for anime fans. Characters from favorite shows, such as Astro Boy, Naruto, Digimon, Pokémon, and Dragon Ball Z, spring to life in video games, fulfilling their missions at the push of a button. Just like figures from long ago, the images on the screen enact tales of adventure and daring. The dynamic characters in anime, though, take modern storytelling art to a whole new level.",1277.0
" Toad, after due consultation with his friends, selected a handsome gold chain and locket set with pearls, which he dispatched to the gaoler’s daughter with a letter that even the Badger admitted to be modest, grateful, and appreciative; and the engine driver, in his turn, was properly thanked and compensated for all his pains and trouble. Under severe compulsion from the Badger, even the barge-woman was, with some trouble, sought out and the value of her horse discreetly made good to her; though Toad kicked terribly at this, holding himself to be an instrument of Fate, sent to punish fat women with mottled arms who couldn’t tell a real gentleman when they saw one. The amount involved, it was true, was not very burdensome, the gipsy’s valuation being admitted by local assessors to be approximately correct.
Sometimes, in the course of long summer evenings, the friends would take a stroll together in the Wild Wood, now successfully tamed so far as they were concerned; and it was pleasing to see how respectfully they were greeted by the inhabitants, and how the mother weasels would bring their young ones to the mouths of their holes, and say, pointing, ‘Look, baby! There goes the great Mr. Toad! And that’s the gallant Water Rat, a terrible fighter, walking along o’ him! And yonder comes the famous Mr. Mole, of whom you so often have heard your father tell!’ But when their infants were fractious and quite beyond control, they would quiet them by telling how, if they didn’t hush them and not fret them, the terrible grey Badger would up and get them. This was a base libel on Badger, who, though he cared little about Society, was rather fond of children; but it never failed to have its full effect.",1465.0
" Lincoln was finally convinced that as president, he had the authority to order abolition in the South. On January 1, 1863, the Emancipation Proclamation went into effect, freeing “thenceforth and forever” all the slaves in the South. Freed blacks rushed to join the Union army, and by the end of the war, over 180,000 former slaves had volunteered.
The summer of 1863 brought victory to Union forces at Gettysburg, a turning point in the war. President Lincoln, while dedicating a cemetery to the many soldiers who had died, delivered his famous Gettysburg Address. The speech lasted only two minutes, yet it is remembered for its simple beauty and eloquence. Lincoln spoke of the war as a test of whether the nation could survive as a democracy. He challenged those still alive to complete the unfinished work of those who had died, “that the government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.”
Under the newly appointed General Ulysses S. Grant, the Union armies were victorious in the West and South. Lincoln saw hope of the war’s end as Confederate troops were defeated in Georgia and Virginia in late 1864. He was re-elected president and, in early 1865, cheered the Congressional passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which prohibited slavery in the United States.
The war ended on April 9, 1865, four years after it began, and cost 600,000 lives. The Union was preserved, and slavery was abolished. But only six days later, President Abraham Lincoln lay dead from an assassin’s bullet. A Confederate sympathizer, John Wilkes Booth, shot Lincoln while he attended a play at Washington’s Ford’s Theatre. As Lincoln’s body was carried back to his beloved Illinois on a funeral train, mourners by the roadside silently saluted this great American hero.",1147.0
" The other dog made no advances, nor received any; also, he did not attempt to steal from the newcomers. He was a gloomy, morose fellow, and he showed Curly plainly that all he desired was to be left alone, and further, that there would be trouble if he were not left alone. “Dave” he was called, and he ate and slept, or yawned between times, and took interest in nothing, not even when the Narwhal crossed Queen Charlotte Sound and rolled and pitched and bucked like a thing possessed. When Buck and Curly grew excited, half wild with fear, he raised his head as though annoyed, favored them with an incurious glance, yawned, and went to sleep again. Day and night the ship throbbed to the tireless pulse of the propeller, and though one day was very like another, it was apparent to Buck that the weather was steadily growing colder. At last, one morning, the propeller was quiet, and the Narwhal was pervaded with an atmosphere of excitement. He felt it, as did the other dogs, and knew that a change was at hand.
François leashed them and brought them on deck. At the first step upon the cold surface, Buck’s feet sank into a white mushy something very like mud. He sprang back with a snort. More of this white stuff was falling through the air. He shook himself, but more of it fell upon him. He sniffed it curiously, then licked some up on his tongue. It bit like fire, and the next instant was gone. This puzzled him. He tried it again, with the same result. The on-lookers laughed uproariously, and he felt ashamed, he knew not why, for it was his first snow.",1013.0
" The dog-driver held the axe poised in his hand, and as Buck shot past him the axe crashed down upon mad Dolly’s head. Buck staggered over against the sled, exhausted, sobbing for breath, helpless. This was Spitz’s opportunity. He sprang upon Buck, and twice his teeth sank into his unresisting foe and ripped and tore the flesh to the bone. Then François’s lash descended, and Buck had the satisfaction of watching Spitz receive the worst whipping as yet administered to any of the teams.
“One devil, dat Spitz,” remarked Perrault. “Some dam day heem keel dat Buck.” “Dat Buck two devils,” was François’s rejoinder. “All de tam I watch dat Buck I know for sure. Lissen: some dam fine day heem get mad lak hell an’ den heem chew dat Spitz all up an’ spit heem out on de snow. Sure. I know.” From then on it was war between them. Spitz, as lead-dog and acknowledged master of the team, felt his supremacy threatened by this strange Southland dog. And strange Buck was to him, for of the many Southland dogs he had known, not one had shown up worthily in camp and on trail. They were all too soft, dying under the toil, the frost, and starvation. Buck was the exception. He alone endured and prospered, matching the husky in strength, savagery, and cunning. Then he was a masterful dog, and what made him dangerous was the fact that the club of the man in the red sweater had knocked all blind pluck and rashness out of his desire for mastery. He was preeminently cunning, and could bide his time with a patience that was nothing less than primitive.",932.0
" Also, they held it a mercy, since Dave was to die anyway, that he should die in the traces, heart-easy and content. So he was harnessed in again, and proudly he pulled as of old, though more than once he cried out involuntarily from the bite of his inward hurt. Several times he fell down and was dragged in the traces, and once the sled ran upon him so that he limped thereafter in one of his hind legs. But he held out till camp was reached, when his driver made a place for him by the fire. Morning found him too weak to travel. At harness-up time he tried to crawl to his driver. By convulsive efforts he got on his feet, staggered, and fell. Then he wormed his way forward slowly toward where the harnesses were being put on his mates. He would advance his forelegs and drag up his body with a sort of hitching movement, when he would advance his forelegs and hitch ahead again for a few more inches.
His strength left him, and the last his mates saw of him he lay gasping in the snow and yearning toward them. But they could hear him mournfully howling till they passed out of sight behind a belt of river timber. Here the train was halted. The Scotch half-breed slowly retraced his steps to the camp they had left. The men ceased talking. A revolver-shot rang out. The man came back hurriedly. The whips snapped, the bells tinkled merrily, the sleds churned along the trail; but Buck knew, and every dog knew, what had taken place behind the belt of river trees.",964.0
" The small lava chunks and bits of ash harden into lightweight black rocks called cinders. The cinders pile up around the vent into a cone-shaped hill with a crater at the top. Such hills are called cinder cones. Brand-new volcanoes that suddenly appear often form cinder cones. Other cinder cones pile up inside the craters or calderas of larger, older volcanoes. Most cinder cones erupt only once. Because cinder cones are made of loose rocks, they usually erode quickly in the wind and rain.
Lava domes also result from small, brief eruptions, but the lava that forms these structures is a thick, pasty liquid that oozes from the vent and quickly hardens. Sometimes, more lava pushes up and expands through the center of the dome, cracking the outside. These domes often form in areas with other volcanic activity. They are often found in the craters and calderas of larger volcanoes. Like composite volcanoes, lava domes often explode violently.
Volcanoes are the most spectacular evidence we have that Earth is a changing planet. Lava pouring from a volcanic vent creates new rock and new land. Volcanic ash makes extremely fertile soil that is useful for farming. In some places, people use the geothermal energy from volcanoes to run power plants and produce electricity. Some people even live inside volcanoes! In Rabaul, in the country of Papua New Guinea, volcanoes sometimes erupt inside the town. Volcanic mountains, including Mount Fuji in Japan, Mount Rainier in Washington, and Mauna Loa in Hawaii, are some of the most recognizable and beautiful mountains in the world. It is no wonder that humans often choose to live near volcanoes. But we should always remember that volcanoes can be violent, dangerous places. Volcanoes unleash some of Earth’s most powerful forces.",1068.0
" When the oceans are healthy, puffins thrive.
Wildlife scientist and puffin expert Dr. Stephen Kress first became interested in nature in fourth grade. He saw that spreading suburbs near his home were wiping out natural habitats. As he learned more about nature, he decided to pursue a career in wildlife.
In the early 1970s, Dr. Kress visited Eastern Egg Rock, a small island off the coast of Maine. Atlantic puffins had lived there one hundred years earlier. Dr. Kress wondered if it might be possible to bring them back. He founded Project Puffin and used imaginative techniques—including “thinking like a puffin”—to bring these seabirds back to Eastern Egg Rock. As of 2014, the island had 148 breeding pairs.
Project Puffin is sponsored by the National Audubon Society, which works to protect birds, other wildlife, and their habitats. To learn more about Project Puffin, visit the program’s website: http://projectpuffin.audubon.org/.
To see puffins in the wild, keep in mind that they’re out at sea for a good part of each year. They’re only on land during the breeding season. They’ll mainly be found on remote cliffs and islands, but it’s worth the effort if you can get there. Choose a place that allows wildlife viewing, and be careful not to disturb nesting birds.
People may hike many miles to see puffins and only catch a faraway glimpse of one or two. You may have an easier time seeing them on a boat tour, and you’ll likely be able to observe them from a closer distance. Tour operators know the best places to find puffins, and they’ll share many details regarding the habits of these birds. Wherever you go to see puffins, be sure to bring binoculars and a camera. These pint-sized clowns are guaranteed to amuse and fascinate.",1019.0
" The Gaucho Festival of San Antonio de Areco is a popular event that takes place every November. Gauchos show their horseback-riding skills during a ten-day celebration that includes bronco riding, parades, and dancing.Another important celebration in Argentina is the national day of independence on July 9. Families and friends spend time together to honor the events of 1816. They celebrate with traditional food and parades.
As in other areas of Argentine culture, Spanish, French, and Italian immigrants to Argentina have brought their own tastes to what citizens eat. Today, foods from all these cultures are popular in Argentina. Since meat is widely plentiful, it is not unusual for people to eat beef twice a day. Steak and other cuts of meat are always available and are often grilled on an open pit or barbecue. Served nearly everywhere, empanadas are tasty pastries that can be filled with meat, vegetables, cheese, or fruit. Italian foods such as ravioli, pasta, and pizza are also popular. Besides food, another product consumed by Argentines is a tea called yerba maté. This drink is made from the dried leaves of the yerba maté plant. Argentines say it gives them energy and helps their minds stay alert.
Solidly shaped by its European roots, Argentina has much to offer, including its beautiful land as well as its population, which has expanded to include people from China, South Korea, and other Asian nations. Argentines are committed to democracy and feel that their country will continue to prosper. A forward-thinking country, Argentina sets strict standards to protect the environment, encourages women to take part in government, and believes in equal rights for all people. Although political unrest has been a big part of the country’s past, its citizens—along with the rest of the world—hold great hope for its future.",1142.0

When Frank Romero, who is of Mexican descent, began painting more than forty years ago, he became part of a group of artists called Los Four. During the civil rights movement, Los Four used their art to help raise awareness of and pride in Hispanic culture. In 1974, their work was exhibited in the first major art show featuring U.S. Hispanic artists in the country’s history. Romero’s art often depicts social conflicts and struggles. It can also be large! He has painted more than fifteen murals around Los Angeles, some more than 20 feet (6 m) in length. His art has also appeared in shows around the world.
From the time she was a little girl, Sonia Sotomayor, who is of Puerto Rican descent, dreamed of becoming a judge. Sotomayor became the first member of her family to graduate from college. In 1992, she became the first Hispanic federal judge in all of New York State. In 2009, Sotomayor achieved her biggest “first” yet. She became the first Hispanic judge on the Supreme Court, the highest court in the country. Every year, Sotomayor and the eight other Supreme Court judges select the cases they hear. Their decisions on the cases can affect the way people in the United States live. Since Sotomayor joined the court, she has heard cases dealing with health care, parental rights, gun control, and much more.

Human activities are not the only causes of wildlife injuries. Natural disasters, such as wildfires, tsunamis, and hurricanes, hurt animals, too. Terri Crisp spends much of her time rescuing animals that are affected by natural disasters. During a raging California wildfire in 1986, Terri rescued a Shetland pony by coaxing it into a car. She worked to save sea otters and loons in 1989 during the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska, and in 1992, she worked to rescue hundreds of animals hurt by Hurricane Andrew. She founded the organization Noah’s Wish to train volunteers to rescue animals that are at risk because of disasters.
Incredibly, many wild animals knew to run inland before the 2004 Asian tsunami hit land; however, pets and farm animals did not fare so well. Several people in the areas hit by the tsunami depended on working farm animals; many of these animals were killed, injured, or left in devastated areas without food. The Humane Society International worked with other organizations and volunteers to help the animals—and the people who cared for them—get their lives back on track.
Rehabbers often use animals that cannot return to the wild as ambassadors to help teach people to respect wildlife. Children and adults learn about wildlife that live in their local area and about respecting habitats so that wild animals can continue to find food and shelter. Wildlife rehabbers do important work in caring for injured wild animals and returning many of them to the wild. You can help rehabbers’ efforts by respecting wildlife and by calling a rehabber if you see an animal in distress. One phone call might give a wild animal the opportunity to grow up and live a free and healthy life.",1174.0

Soon after the destruction of the Twin Towers, people launched plans to build a new structure on the site. In 2006, after much debate, construction of a new tower, One World Trade Center, began. The tower is one of the tallest buildings in the world. It was completed in 2014. Other towers are still being built on the site.
In addition to the new buildings, a memorial and a museum were built at Ground Zero. The memorial honors those who lost their lives in the attacks. It features two large reflecting pools set within a grove of trees. The names of all the victims are inscribed in bronze panels bordering the pools. The memorial also features North America’s largest artificial waterfalls. The pools and twin waterfalls were built within the footprints of where the Twin Towers once stood. The museum tells the story of 9/11 and the events leading up to the tragic day. It has portraits of the victims of the attack and artifacts from the original site. The museum’s purpose is to educate the millions of people who visit the site each year. The hope is that what they learn will help build a better future for all people and prevent a tragedy like 9/11 from ever happening again.",939.0
" It is known from two well-preserved fossils, about 145 million years old, which were discovered in Europe. Compsognathus was one of the smallest dinosaurs that ever lived—some of these creatures were only the size of a chicken. Compsognathus had a long, thin neck and tail and long hind legs. On each of its short front legs, it had only two claws—an unusual feature for a dinosaur. Like other coelurosaurs, Compsognathus hunted by running after insects, lizards, and other diminutive animals and grabbing them with its razor-sharp claws and teeth.
Scientists know what this dinosaur ate because one of the fossils of Compsognathus includes the remains of its last meal in its stomach. The type of lizard seen in the stomach had extremely long legs, so this lizard must have been a fast runner. Thus, Compsognathus had to be quick to capture this prey.
Much has been learned about prehistoric animal life from fossils. Some of the most fascinating fossils ever uncovered prove that, ages ago, there were creatures that had some characteristics of birds and other characteristics of reptiles. Fossils of these organisms lead scientists to theorize that birds developed from dinosaurs. Dinosaurs roamed the Earth for more than 150 million years, but they were unable to adapt when environmental conditions changed about 65 million years ago. According to scientists, Earth’s climate may have changed dramatically around that time, perhaps as the result of a meteorite impact. Although dinosaurs did not survive this change, birds did. Today, there are more than 9,700 species of birds thriving from the frigid Arctic and Antarctic to the torrid tropics. Some scientists actually classify birds as living dinosaurs. So the next time you see a songbird singing outside your window, might you really be watching and listening to a dinosaur?",1128.0

For many years, most people knew Leonardo da Vinci only as an artist since he had created such masterpieces as The Last Supper and La Gioconda, better known to Americans as The Mona Lisa. They had no reason to think of him as anything other than a wonderful painter, especially since his only published book was on the subject of art. It wasn’t until the Industrial Revolution in the 1880s that Leonardo’s documents began to resurface, and people learned of his innovative ideas. By then, many of his creations had been reinvented and the credit given to others. Many areas of study could have been advanced by Leonardo’s ideas centuries ago, if only half of his 13,000 pages of research and drawings hadn’t been lost. Leonardo da Vinci’s art and notebooks have been studied or written about by such famous people as the playwright Oscar Wilde, the poet William Butler Yeats, the psychologist Sigmund Freud, the scientist Albert Einstein, and the artist Andy Warhol. One of his biographers wrote that Leonardo has always been “more studied than understood,” since he didn’t write much in his journals about his personal life and feelings. Leonardo also didn’t date most of his works and notebooks, so there is much confusion about when things occurred in his life and why.
Although his biographies contradict one another, the fascination of Leonardo’s life and discoveries continues even today. He created over 1,500 detailed drawings of the human body, which was a great achievement. His enormous contribution to scientific studies in the area of anatomical illustrations alone is priceless. He lived his life in pursuit of knowledge and took on the responsibility of solving problems on his own. He certainly modeled his life after one of his quotes, “Knowledge of all things is possible.”",1283.0
" Another important celebration is the Lantern Festival, called Obon. Held in the summer, Obon allows the Japanese to honor their ancestors. During the festival, lanterns or candles are lit and set on rivers and lakes to float slowly away.
Rice is an important part of the Japanese diet. It is sometimes served in small round cakes, called mochi (MOH-chee), as a snack. Japanese people also rely heavily on the surrounding ocean for food and incorporate fish and other seafood into many meals. In cities, sushi (SOO-shee) and sashimi (sah-SHEE-mee), both made with raw fish, are popular fast food choices. Many Japanese believe that food should look just as good as it tastes. Meals are typically served as several different small dishes, including soups and sometimes noodles. Like their Chinese neighbors, the Japanese usually eat with chopsticks, which are long, thin utensils made of wood. The Japanese follow many rules when preparing and presenting certain types of food. For example, one traditional ceremony is centered around serving tea and includes a highly organized and elegant process. This tea ceremony is usually held in a special room created just for that purpose.
Japan is a small island country covered with mountains, yet it includes crowded, bustling cities filled with high-tech industries. The land shakes with earthquakes, volcanoes erupt, and typhoons rage, but Japan’s people continue to thrive. Over thousands of years, the Japanese have learned to make the most of the land and waters around them. They grow tons of rice in small areas. They harvest large amounts of fish and seafood from the ocean, too. Timeless traditions and customs mingle with cutting-edge technology, making Japan a place that embraces two worlds—the ancient and the modern.",997.0
" The computer converts the signals into an image that takes the shape of the radio waves emitted from their source. The computer also assigns different colors to various parts of an image to indicate the different strengths of radio waves within the image.
Land-based telescopes will continue to grow in size and their technology will become more specialized. The powerful digital camera on the Pan STARRS 1 (PS 1) telescope in Hawaii tracks asteroids and comets that might threaten Earth. It can map one sixth of the sky every month. Once it becomes operational, the newer PS 4 will be four times as powerful as the PS 1. But there is little doubt that future observation of space objects will be best accomplished in space, beyond any interference from Earth’s atmosphere. Scientists are hard at work building a telescope that will replace the Hubble.
The new telescope, called the James Webb Space Telescope, will have a 6.5-meter (20 ft.) diameter mirror. It will have a tennis-court-sized shield to block the Sun’s radiation. The mirror’s light-gathering capacity will be ten times greater than that of the Hubble Telescope. The Webb Telescope will gather both visible light waves and low-energy infrared waves. In order to get an object this large into orbit, it will be launched folded up and then unfolded in orbit. Most scientists agree that the ultimate telescope would be built on the Moon. Scientists are planning an observatory that would be built on the Moon’s surface. Since the Moon has very little atmosphere, there would be minimal interference to light coming from distant objects in space. The mysteries of space are slowly being revealed. No one knows what the newest telescopes will discover, but whatever it is, these powerful eyes on space will help us to see it for ourselves!",1097.0

His North Vietnamese corecipient, Le Duc Tho (LE DUK TAH), turned down the prize to avoid being associated with Kissinger. Even President Barack Obama’s Peace Prize in 2009 was questioned. The election of an African American president was groundbreaking and inspired the world with hope. Yet in 2009, he hadn’t done much more than get elected. The award surprised even the president himself.
The Nobel Foundation awards cash, a diploma, and a gold medal with Alfred Nobel’s image to each prizewinner. The ceremony takes place at the Stockholm Concert Hall. The King of Sweden hands the gold Nobel Prize Medal to the recipient in a box. At a later date, the recipient is given a document stating the amount of the cash prize. The amount varies based on whether the award is given to an individual or shared among a group. In 2015, the amount of an individual prize was eight million Swedish kronor, or just under one million U.S. dollars. If the prize is shared among multiple recipients, the eight million Swedish kronor are divided equally. Then the guests are transported to the Stockholm City Hall for the Nobel Banquet. There are speeches, dancing, a full concert, and a fancy dinner. Formal dress is required.
Although not without controversy, the Nobel Prize has had a lasting and positive global influence. The awards highlight the work and dreams of great thinkers from all over the world. The fame and cash prizes let these extraordinary individuals continue their work. The prizes honor freedom, peace, and the commitment to improving the lives of humankind.",976.0
" Researchers are now working on creating a human heart made of both natural tissue and artificial materials. People who receive 3D organs may avoid the usual problem faced by transplant patients—rejection of the new organ. Whenever a foreign object is introduced into the body, the immune system treats it as a threat and attacks it. Transplant patients must take special medicine after surgery so their immune system doesn’t destroy the transplanted organ. This medicine may also make patients more prone to infection. However, if the organ is made from the patient’s own cells, rejection is less likely to occur. Patients may not have to take as much medicine, and they heal and recover more quickly with fewer complications.
Some 3D engineers have taken this technology to new heights—literally! A team of architects in Amsterdam is using a giant, portable version of a 3D printer to build a three-story house out of plastic. The machine creates interlocking bricks from layers of melted plastic that will be assembled into thirteen rooms. Construction will take three years—a long time by house-building standards. The team hopes this experiment will open the door to new ways of thinking about home construction using manufacturing processes such as 3D printing.
The future of 3D printing holds endless possibilities. This amazing technology allows people to customize all sorts of products, from plastic dental braces to apartment-sized furniture to buildings. As the technology continues to evolve, 3D printers may be used in rather unusual situations, such as long-term space missions. With a 3D printer on board their spacecraft, astronauts would be able to manufacture replacement parts should old parts break down, or design and create new devices to help them live in space. This innovative technology could help humans survive as they explore strange, new worlds!",1172.0
" They won yet again at Camden, South Carolina, in August 1780. These three battles had the highest casualty rates of the war. Many colonists in the southern colonies were Loyalists. Although Britain was winning the South, the Patriots would not give up. The tide of the war started to turn in favor of the Patriots in October when they won a battle at King’s Mountain, South Carolina, in a speedy sixty-five minutes. This battle was one of the few in the war that did not involve British soldiers— it was fought by Patriots against Loyalists. The Patriots again won battles at Camden and Cowpens. Next, they forced British General Charles Cornwallis north into Virginia. Cornwallis had aided the British victory at Long Island and had taken command of British troops in the South. The Patriots’ alliance with the French began to pay off. French soldiers helped hold back the British and fought alongside colonists as part of the troops Washington led into Virginia.
The most important battle of the war was about to begin. French ships drove off the British ships sent to rescue Cornwallis and his troops at Yorktown, on the coast of Virginia. The French fleet also brought extra soldiers to help the fight on land. The French and Patriot troops moved into Yorktown, laying siege to the British army for three weeks before they surrendered on October 19, 1781, thus ending the Revolutionary War. The Patriots had won their war and were now independent from Britain. The United States of America officially became independent from Great Britain with the Peace of Paris in 1783. Now a group of colonies that was used to being supported by another country had to come together and build a brand new nation.",1046.0
" Their vehicles were open to attack from Allied tanks and fighter planes that had already arrived at Sword. The German counterattack failed, but it did prevent British troops from linking up with Canadian troops from Juno Beach that day as planned. While the British were unable to reach the town of Caen, the mission was still considered a huge victory for the Allies. Allied forces managed to stabilize the beach and advance roughly 4 miles (6.4 km) inland before meeting up with the Canadians the following day. Allied troops would eventually capture the town of Caen six weeks later, on July 20, 1944.
Although the cost in Allied and Axis soldiers’ lives was high, Operation Overlord was a tremendous success. Through great sacrifice, Allied forces succeeded in gaining a foothold from which to begin to push back German forces and free occupied France. While this operation was a huge military victory for the Allies, it was also a day of mourning. Owing to the large amount of activity on D-Day, it was difficult to record accurate numbers of casualties on either side. The term casualties refers to all losses suffered by the armed forces: killed, wounded, missing in action, and prisoners of war. Historians estimate that the Germans had between four thousand and nine thousand casualties, and the Allies had more than six thousand casualties on D-Day. The war dragged on for roughly another year as Allied troops continued to capture German-occupied territories in Europe. Germany finally surrendered on May 8, 1945, and Japan surrendered on August 15, 1945, officially ending the war. D-Day and the eventual liberation of France proved to be significant turning points in World War II. Without the efforts and sacrifices of Allied soldiers on D-Day, the war may have had a much different outcome.",1245.0

If you have a family garden, you can donate extra produce to a local food pantry—or plant an extra patch of vegetables to donate! You can also donate part of your allowance and encourage others to do the same. Kids in Loudoun County, Virginia, came up with a plan to allow kids to donate a dime to the food bank each time they bought lunch. Encourage a school campaign to buy products to support food banks or work with a local company to raise funds for a local food bank. Find out what the local food bank and charities need and at what time of year the need is greatest. Share what you find with friends, family, and neighbors. Most people don’t know a lot about hunger in their own communities. Let them know by writing a letter to your local newspaper. Write a report on hunger in your community and present it to your class. Write letters to your representatives in Congress and to your state and local governments. Encourage them to support programs that help ensure that no child goes hungry.

" Evidence suggests that tribes from far and wide journeyed to Stonehenge and many settled there permanently. Perhaps they came to trade or band together for protection, or they could have been drawn by an abundance of food in the region.
Stonehenge is one of the most famous prehistoric landmarks in Europe. The Stonehenge the public sees today is not what people saw in 1900. By then, most of the giant stones had tilted or toppled. But in the last century, heritage groups have restored parts of the monument based on archaeological evidence. In 1958, cranes were used to lift some of the stones, and some of the standing stones were anchored in concrete. The restorers believed these restorations would give the public a better idea of the monument’s original appearance.
Researchers continue to investigate Stonehenge and the surrounding area. Today, they use the latest technology to help them map what is hidden beneath their feet. This equipment includes magnetometers that detect magnetic fields, laser scanners that measure potential archaeological sites precisely, and ground- penetrating radar that can scan as deep as 9 meters (29.5 ft.) underground.
Stonehenge is an amazing landmark of an ancient time and place. Visitors marvel at the ingenuity of those who designed the monument to align with the sun’s movements. Impressed by its massive stones, they can pictu0he kind of teamwork and muscle it must have required to raise the heavy stones and link them together. For centuries, Stonehenge served as a central sacred site for the people who lived in the lands around it. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) named Stonehenge a World Heritage Site worthy of special recognition and protection. Today, it stirs the imaginations of people all around the world.",1126.0

He had travelled some miles, his horse and he, and he was feeling drowsy in the hot sunshine, when the horse stopped, lowered his head, and began to nibble the grass; and Toad, waking up, just saved himself from falling off by an effort. He looked about him and found he was on a wide common dotted with patches of gorse and bramble as far as he could see. Near him stood a dingy gipsy caravan, and beside it a man was sitting on a bucket turned upside down, very busy smoking and staring into the wide world. A fire of sticks was burning nearby, and over the fire hung an iron pot, and out of that pot came forth bubblings and gurglings, and a vague suggestive steaminess. Also smells—warm, rich, and varied smells—that twined and twisted and wreathed themselves at last into one complete, voluptuous, perfect smell that seemed like the very soul of Nature taking form and appearing to her children, a true Goddess, a mother of solace and comfort. Toad now knew well that he had not been really hungry before. What he had felt earlier in the day had been a mere trifling qualm. This was the real thing at last, and no mistake; and it would have to be dealt with speedily, too, or there would be trouble for somebody or something. He looked the gipsy over carefully, wondering vaguely whether it would be easier to fight him or cajole him. So there he sat, and sniffed and sniffed, and looked at the gipsy; and the gipsy sat and smoked, and looked at him.
Presently the gipsy took his pipe out of his mouth and remarked in a careless way, “Want to sell that there horse of yours?”",1260.0
" Port cities also suffered as the Luftwaffe tried to cut off relief supplies carried by convoys of Canadian and American ships. After eight months of bombing, the Luftwaffe conducted the last of its massive raids on May 10, 1941. In June, Germany launched a surprise invasion of Russia and the rest of the Soviet Union. The Blitz was over. Between the Battle of Britain and the Blitz, Great Britain was battered and burned after months of air war. Some 40,000 British civilians had died, and more than a million homes were destroyed or badly damaged. The country, though, had thwarted Hitler’s grand plan and survived to carry on the fight.
Great Britain had withstood everything Nazi Germany could drop on it. Now British forces had the chance to regroup, rebuild, and rearm. By the beginning of 1942, Great Britain had formed a formidable alliance with the United States, which had entered the war in December 1941, as well as the Soviet Union. American bombers and fighter planes joined the RAF in striking German targets on the continent. By holding out against the Luftwaffe’s overwhelming air campaign, Great Britain had preserved a crucial base for Allied air operations. Together, the British and Americans used their air power to pound Germany’s forces, industry, and cities. In a great irony, Great Britain was the staging ground for an Allied invasion of German-occupied France a few years later, in June 1944.
On June 18, 1940—before the Battle of Britain began—Prime Minister Winston Churchill had delivered a speech. He encouraged British citizens to uphold their duty to their country so that when future generations looked back on this time, they would say it was Britain’s “finest hour.” To many British, their country’s conduct and courage in World War II still represent its finest hour.",1121.0

Although those young Czech refugees are now old, many still call themselves “Winton’s Children.” Some made their own remarkable contributions to the world as research scientists, religious leaders, and filmmakers. Winton’s work has earned him much recognition and many honors from the governments of both Great Britain and the Czech Republic. In 2002, he was made a knight by Queen Elizabeth II, an award reserved for people who have demonstrated acts of bravery, service, or success. In 2014, he received the Czech Republic’s highest honor, the Order of the White Lion. Winton even had a distant planet named for him by two Czech astronomers.
In 2009, to mark the seventieth anniversary of Winton’s last train, a railroad trip repeated the journey that Winton’s Children made between Prague and London. The train followed the same route; on board were many of those Winton had saved. Winton greeted the group himself at London’s Liverpool Street station with open arms. The trip came a few months after he celebrated his 100th birthday.
After his secret was revealed, Winton spoke often about his decision to save the Czech children. He claimed that he did nothing special or heroic, which is why he never talked about it. “I just saw what was going on and did what I could to help,” he once said. To thank Winton for his actions, some of the people he saved gave him a ring. It’s inscribed with a line from a book of Jewish laws known as the Talmud. It reads: “Save one life, save the world.” Sir Nicholas Winton died on July 1, 2015, on the 76th anniversary of a train journey that carried the largest number of children from Prague—241.

" George III began to prepare his country for another war. The Napoleonic Wars lasted until Great Britain finally defeated Napoleon in 1815.
In 1809, at the age of seventy-one, King George III was in his fiftieth year on the throne. He attained more popularity in his old age than he ever knew previously. A terrible personal tragedy befell him the following year, when his youngest daughter, Princess Amelia, died of tuberculosis. She was just twenty-seven, and her death seemed to trigger a decline in his health, both mental and physical. Nearly blind and very thin, King George relapsed into the mental illness that had tortured him decades earlier. His violent mood swings became more common. In 1811, his son George, Prince of Wales, became regent, or temporary ruler, of Great Britain by an act of Parliament. In January 1820, the king died, and his son became King George IV. Tens of thousands attended the royal funeral.
King George is remembered as a strong yet complicated man. Some historians think of George III as the king who lost important colonies in America and defeated Napoleon. Others often focus on his mental health issues. However, many historians have begun to rethink their opinions of him. Many historians now believe symptoms of his mental illness could be linked to a rare physical disease. As a leader, George III always put his country first. He led his nation to victories in the Seven Years’ War and the Napoleonic Wars. He also fought to keep Great Britain’s colonies in America. The king’s personal life has been given more consideration, and history has shown that George was a hard worker, a loyal husband, and a loving father.",1020.0
" On May 10, 1869, workers, railroad owners, journalists, and politicians gathered at Promontory Point for the completion of the Transcontinental Railroad. The race was over—the Union Pacific had laid 1,086 miles (1,748 km) of track, and the Central Pacific had laid 689 miles (1,109 km), though the Central Pacific got extra money for building through the Sierra Nevada.
To celebrate the completion of the first railroad to cross the United States, the heads of the two companies would drive the last four spikes into the track. Four spikes were made of gold and silver from mines in California, Nevada, and Arizona. These spikes had lengthy inscriptions and required a special hammer for a ceremonial “tapping” before the real spikes were driven into place. Workers from both companies dragged the last rails into place. Leland Stanford, head of the Central Pacific, and Thomas Durant, head of the Union Pacific, both took up sledgehammers. They carefully aimed—and missed! But the telegraph reporters sent out the signal anyway. The telegram was one word: “Done!” The Transcontinental Railroad was complete.
Suddenly, California was a few days of travel away from New York instead of months. Railroads soon stretched to Salt Lake City, Oregon Territory, and the Southwest. Towns sprang up along the track now that trains could bring passengers, supplies, and mail quickly and safely. The Union Pacific and the Central Pacific made millions of dollars because every railroad town had to purchase land from the railroad companies. The end of the Civil War had reunited the country from north to south. And for the first time, a transcontinental railroad united the country from east to west.",1090.0
" It will be difficult to maintain different growing conditions inside your greenhouse box.
Use the clothespins to attach the second sheet of plastic to the top of your box. Now you have a greenhouse. Place your greenhouse in a sunny location inside your house and watch your seeds sprout.
Check on your greenhouse about once a week. Be sure the soil inside your greenhouse stays moist, but not wet. After the initial watering of your seeds, use a spray bottle of distilled water (water that has been left out overnight in a container with no lid) to keep your plants watered. You may notice some water form on the inside of the plastic cover. This is normal, but make sure the soil is not too wet. If the soil does become too wet, pull back the plastic sheet so the greenhouse can dry out some before re-covering the box. After your seeds have germinated, weed out the weakest plants. Leave only the strongest plants in the small space of the greenhouse. You can make the strong plants stronger by feeding them plant food or compost after weeding out the weaker plants. Do this only if the plants will later be moving to a garden outside. Plant food and compost will likely make the plants outgrow your indoor greenhouse too quickly if you want them to remain indoors during their whole growing cycle.
You now have a place in which you can enjoy gardening year-round like other gardeners around the globe. You can try growing plants, fruits, vegetables, seedlings, and flowers in your protected cardboard greenhouse, even when there is snow outside.

During one game, two Detroit fans threw the body of an octopus from a seafood shop onto the ice—eight legs for eight needed wins. Detroit ended up winning that year, and the octopus was considered good luck. This strange Detroit tradition continued for years. In one 1995 game, fans threw thirty-six octopuses onto the ice. In yet another 1995 playoff game, two fans tossed a 38-pound (17.2 kg) octopus onto the ice. The next year, a 50-pound (22.7 kg) octopus was thrown onto the ice. This crazy tradition continues today!
The Edmonton Oilers could have been mistaken for an All-Star Team from 1983 to 1990. Led by “The Great One,” Wayne Gretzky (GRET-ski), the team won five Stanley Cups during those years. Gretzky was so dominant that Boston Bruins coach Terry O’Reilly once said, “He’s the best. There should be a league rule that he has to be passed around from team to team every year.” Gretzky wasn’t the only Oilers star, however. Six other Oilers players from that era were also inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame. Years later, the team was officially awarded Dynasty status by the Hockey Hall of Fame for its long string of wins in relatively few years.

"S. soldier can earn.
In 1898, the Buffalo Soldiers fought in the Spanish-American War. The conflict lasted ten weeks. They took part in many battles and earned five Medals of Honor. Even so, some leaders in the U.S. Army still thought black soldiers were unable to perform as well as white soldiers.
In the 1890s, the army wanted to see if bikes could replace horses since bikes were cheaper and easier to care for. The Buffalo Soldiers rode 1,900 miles from Fort Missoula, Montana, to St. Louis, Missouri. The roads were bad. They crossed the Rockies, rivers, and shifting sandhills, and still averaged 50 miles a day. Before long, though, bikes were replaced with motorcycles.
After that war, between 1899 and 1904, the Buffalo Soldiers worked as park rangers, serving in Sequoia, Yosemite, and Kings Canyon National Parks in California. They built roads and trails, fought forest fires, and stopped people from hunting animals and stealing timber. During World Wars I and II, the original cavalry and infantry units were disbanded and reorganized. The new regiments were still called Buffalo Soldiers, though, and were still led by white officers. They were kept separate from white soldiers until the Korean War (1950–1953). The army disbanded the last regiments of Buffalo Soldiers in 1951, and the troops were integrated into other units.
People have not forgotten about the Buffalo Soldiers. Many books have been written about them. Monuments to them stand in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, and El Paso, Texas.
History remembers the Buffalo Soldiers as tough men who took on tough jobs. Although they were often given poor equipment and supplies, they never let that stop them. In the face of racism, they fought to prove that they were good at their jobs. Their bravery and service are an important part of America’s story.",944.0

Ma has also created several movie soundtracks of his own. He has recorded with bluegrass and jazz musicians as well as with orchestras all over the world.
Because Ma’s blend of backgrounds has always been important to him and his music, he founded the Silk Road Ensemble in 1998. This group is made up of musicians and composers from twenty countries. They collaborate on music that draws from traditions all over the world. The Silk Road was a trade route that ran through Asia hundreds of years ago, uniting cultures across the entire continent.
Silk Road isn’t just a musical ensemble. It’s also a nonprofit group that uses music and art to connect people from different cultures.

While many successful musicians credit hard work or natural talent, Yo-Yo Ma says he has no idea why he became one of the world’s most popular musicians or why other talented performers don’t reach the same level. “I’m an accident,” he once said. He claims his success is a combination of many things—his parents, his sister, various teachers, Paris, New York, his experience performing at a young age, meeting his wife, even raising his children. If any one of those things had been different, he feels as though he might not have become a world-famous musician.

" Third, they face pressure from other cultures, often those that are more powerful in economic terms. These factors may put a language at risk. Field linguists, such as those who work for the Enduring Voices Project, a collaboration between the National Geographic Society and Living Tongues Institute of Endangered Languages, travel the world to catalog and record the most endangered languages. It is important to document fluent speakers of an endangered language to protect the variety of human knowledge. Researchers want to preserve the vocabulary, pronunciation, and grammar of vanishing languages by creating a library of materials. By recording speakers of these languages doing different activities, such as singing a song, preparing a meal, or building a house, linguists create “living dictionaries” that show how these people describe the world around them.
Like students in Hawaii, children around the world take immersion classes as another way for communities to bring back endangered languages. These classes are taught totally in the language that people hope to preserve. For example, only around 125,000 of New Zealand’s 4.7 million people speak Maori, an endangered language of a native Polynesian people. Today, many children take Maori immersion classes. The aim is to get very young children using Maori every day. If young people learn the endangered language, it has a much better chance of staying alive.
Saving languages is about taking care that knowledge and human experience do not disappear. As languages like Chinese, Spanish, and English spread farther around the world, it becomes more difficult to prevent other languages from vanishing. Linguists know that saving Maori, Mandan, or any other endangered language is about more than memorizing words and pronouncing them correctly. It’s about saving a culture and way of life that can teach us more about humanity.",1253.0
" In more recent times, condors died from flying into electrical power lines. These dangers have also lowered the number of Andean condors, but they face additional perils as well. Some South American villagers shoot condors because they believe the birds kill their livestock. Astoundingly, at one time in the United States, fewer than ten California condors were alive in the wild. The species was unbelievably close to extinction. But in 1987, scientists humanely rescued them. Scientists carefully brought the condors to areas where they could safeguard the condors and help them raise their young. After five years and great effort, scientists began releasing California condors back into the wild. They attached numbered tags on the birds’ wings. These tags help the scientists know how many condors exist as well as track how they are coping. By May 2013, more than 230 California condors were flying free. In South America, organizations have secured reserves for condors. They’ve also worked to inform the public about extinction and to clarify that condors are not hazardous to livestock. Today, it is estimated that a few thousand Andean condors survive in the wild.
If you extend your arms straight out from your sides, what do you suppose your “wingspan” is? Whatever the measurement, it’s probably only around half the expanse of an average condor’s wingspan. California and Andean condors are among the most enormous flying birds in the world. They are very rare, so most of us can only imagine a giant condor elegantly sailing above. The populations of these birds were once much larger than they are today, but they are slowly making a comeback. Threats to magnificent condors still exist, but if people understand their plight, condors may be able to soar high in the sky for years to come.",1046.0

After World War I ended, Marie worked tirelessly and successfully to turn the Sorbonne’s Radium Institute into a world-class center for research on radioactivity. Marie’s daughter Irene and her husband were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1935. Sadly, Marie didn’t live long enough to celebrate that achievement. We now know that radioactive substances are very dangerous, but that was not known during Marie’s life. She died at age sixty- six on July 4, 1934, from a type of anemia that is often caused by long-term radiation exposure. Marie was buried next to Pierre. In 1995, their remains were moved to the Panthéon in Paris, where France’s most brilliant citizens are buried. Marie was the first and only woman to be buried there for her own achievements.
Marie Curie’s work caused a revolution in scientific understanding about the nature of atoms and opened up new frontiers in medicine. It also led to the discovery of radiocarbon dating, a way to determine the age of ancient life forms. Marie showed that careful, purposeful scientific investigation can yield extraordinary breakthroughs. As amazing as Marie Curie’s scientific contributions were, her legacy went beyond them.

" Many see this new sport as something that will grow in popularity and attract fans who now enjoy car races or video games. Some sports television channels have even broadcast drone race competitions. Drone races are held around the globe. It seems this sport of the future is really taking off!
As drone use increases, it presents new challenges. Regulators are concerned that drones may pose a hazard to conventional fixed-wing aircraft and standard-sized helicopters. Unlike commercial aircraft, drones are not required to file flight plans and do not show up on flight radar. Because drones are so small, they can be hard for pilots to see until it is too late. And since independently operated drones have no way to communicate with each other, they may collide. For these reasons, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is working to set guidelines for drone operators. As of 2017, drone operators must be licensed. They must notify airports if they will be flying a drone within 8 kilometers (5 mi.) of an airport. Also, drones cannot be flown near national monuments or over major sporting events where many people gather. A disabled or out-of-control drone could put bystanders in danger.
Even with the risks, it seems drones are here to stay. Years ago, people looking to the future predicted that humans would rely on robots to do many tasks they could not or did not want to do. That prediction seems to be coming true as “flying robots” assume a larger role in our lives. Drones, combined with other technological advances, present opportunities for making lives better and letting us see the world from a new perspective. Drones may someday replace fireworks. Swarms of tiny drones equipped with bright multicolored lights can be programmed to fly in formation and create dazzling displays.",1102.0
" It is designed to travel to space on top of a rocket but glide back down to Earth. SpaceX created a different version of its Dragon capsule for moving people back and forth to space stations. Two other companies, Boeing and Blue Origin, also designed capsules that would go up on a rocket and splash down into the ocean at the end of the mission.
What if you wanted to visit space for more than a few minutes at a time? At least one company—Bigelow Aerospace—is working to make space hotels a reality. Bigelow is creating a “balloon habitat.” The habitat folds up into a rocket’s cargo area and expands when it is placed into orbit. The company is working on a unit that will house six people in a space similar in size to the ISS. The skin of the Bigelow habitat is made of strong fabrics such as Mylar and Kevlar. Building a space station out of fabric may seem strange, but Bigelow engineers say that the fabric will actually work better than metal. While these blow-up habitats aren’t ready yet, Bigelow sent two empty test models into space in 2006 and 2007. If things go as planned, more pieces will be launched and joined into the world’s first private space station.
The final flight of the space shuttle marked the end of one period in space travel. It also meant the beginning of an exciting new age of commercial spaceflight. Private companies around the world are working hard to bring their spacecraft designs from the drawing board to the real world. Companies will provide many new options for sending cargo and people into space and for staying in orbit for extended periods of time. Are you ready for the commercial space age?",1075.0
" Although these RC copters are small, they can teach pilots many of the skills necessary to fly bigger helicopters.
Quadrocopters, also known as quadcopters, have four spinning blades, usually at the corners of the vehicle, and can fly in all directions. Autogyros look like a cross between a plane and a helicopter. A propeller at the front or back moves the aircraft forward, which causes the unpowered blades on top to spin and keep the autogyro airborne. One advantage of all the copters is that they don’t need a runway to take off or land.
RC technology isn’t just a hobby. Drones flown by pilots sitting miles away use the same basic technology and can perform various civilian and military tasks. Within the next few years, remote-controlled drones could be flying in your neighborhood. Farmers might soon be using camera-carrying drones to locate crop-eating insects instead of having to physically inspect each field. Hospitals might use drones to fly human organs from one place to another for transplant. Some companies plan to use drones to deliver packages.
TV crews used drones to cover the 2014 Winter Olympic Games in Sochi, Russia. The drones, operated by the Olympic Broadcasting Service, flew across the ski and snowboarding courses. They captured great footage of the events without getting in the way of the athletes.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is looking at creating new rules for commercial drones that would allow them to be used in ways that keep the public safe. Those rules probably won’t affect hobbyists who fly for fun. What seemed like magic one hundred years ago is quickly becoming an important part of our everyday lives. It’s still a blast to play with as well!",1137.0
" It’s ideal for many medical uses, including creating artificial ligaments or nearly invisible stitches for use during eye surgery.
Unfortunately, a single ounce of spider silk requires fourteen thousand spiders. Since spiders tend to eat their neighbors, large-scale “spider farms” are out of the question. Instead, scientists used genetic engineering techniques to insert silk proteins from the golden orb weaver spider into goat DNA. Goats then produce the spider silk proteins in their milk, and scientists extract those proteins in the lab. Someday, researchers hope to engineer goats that can produce commercially useful amounts of spider silk. Since spider genes were artificially introduced—inserted into goat embryos in the laboratory—“spider goats” are considered transgenic rather than hybrid animals.
Animal Hybrids: Problem or Solution?
In the past, scientists thought that animal hybrids represented an evolutionary dead end. Most hybrids were sterile, and even those that could reproduce usually carried a combination of their parents’ traits. The parents were probably well adapted to their specific environments, but by combining their characteristics, the hybrid would end up adapted to neither. In most cases, this is exactly what we see in nature: hybrid species tend to be poorly adapted to their environments and often fail to survive and reproduce. However, when a species faces drastic environmental changes, it may not be able to adapt to changing conditions quickly enough to survive. Hybrids provide a way for two species to exchange genetic information. A hybrid animal could potentially gain traits that would allow it to survive where one or both parents could not. Are hybrid animals a threat to the survival of at-risk species such as the polar bear? Or are they nature’s way of speeding up the adaptation process, helping species cope with rapidly changing environmental conditions? They may be a bit of both—only time will tell!",1245.0
" Experts estimate that over several decades, the Inca population declined by 95 percent. Food supplies to the city may have stopped, and the site was most likely too remote for people to stay without support. As a result, time and nature hid Machu Picchu from the modern world as trees and vines began to cover the city. It stayed hidden for centuries, known only to locals who farmed in the area.
The people of Peru are very proud of Machu Picchu, and in 1983 the ancient city was designated a United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage Site. UNESCO seeks to preserve important historical places that have special cultural or physical significance. Machu Picchu is recognized as a place that can teach future generations a great deal about the Inca culture. When Hiram Bingham left Machu Picchu, he took thousands of artifacts with him. These went to Yale University so he could study them during his years of research. When Bingham died, there the artifacts remained. For almost a century, the Peruvian government asked that they be given back. In 2007 an agreement was reached, and the university returned most of the artifacts.
To preserve the ancient ruins, the Peruvian government has limited Machu Picchu’s daily visitors to 2,500 since 2011. Security cameras, timed visits, and certified guides have also added an extra layer of protection to the famed city. Today, historians continue to study Machu Picchu in hopes of discovering new information about the Inca. We have learned a great deal about their history and customs, but there are many more mysteries to uncover about this amazing culture and place.",1091.0
" She set up twenty mobile X-ray stations and two hundred fixed installations. Not content to just coordinate assistance, Marie learned how to use X-ray equipment and taught herself to drive so she could operate the portable X-ray machines herself.
After World War I ended, Marie worked tirelessly and successfully to turn the Sorbonne’s Radium Institute into a world-class center for research on radioactivity. Marie’s daughter Irene and her husband were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1935. Sadly, Marie didn’t live long enough to celebrate that achievement. We now know that radioactive substances are extremely dangerous, but that was not known during Marie’s life. She died at age sixty-six on July 4, 1934, from a type of anemia that is often caused by prolonged radiation exposure. Marie was buried next to Pierre. In 1995, their remains were moved to the Panthéon in Paris, where France’s most brilliant citizens are buried. Marie was the first and only woman to be buried there for her own achievements.
Marie Curie’s work revolutionized scientific understanding of the nature of atoms and opened up new frontiers in medicine. It also led to the discovery of radiocarbon dating, a way to determine the age of ancient organic material. Marie showed that careful, purposeful scientific investigation can yield extraordinary breakthroughs. As remarkable as Marie Curie’s scientific contributions were, her legacy went beyond them. In the face of persistent discrimination, her clear-sighted certainty about her purpose gave her an unwavering determination and gave the world an inspiring model.

Reefs are living organisms made out of some animals, and they supply food and shelter for other animals. They are sensitive to temperature changes in the ocean. Thousands of species live on the reef, including 1,625 kinds of fish, more than 30 kinds of marine mammals, 500 kinds of seaweed, and 6 kinds of marine turtles. The Reef is also an important breeding area for animals, including birds, sea turtles, and several endangered species, such as the humpback whale, the large green sea turtle, and the dugong, or sea cow.
As one of the most interesting and beautiful places on Earth, the Reef is a popular destination for groups of scientists, scuba divers, and tourists. In 1981, it was listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO, a division of the United Nations that focuses on education, science, and cultures of the world. Environmentalists are working with all of these groups to protect the Reef so future generations can learn from it and enjoy its beauty. Additionally, multiple institutions and universities are performing research at the Reef to learn how they can help protect it.

" The lake would receive and deliver the water from and to the locks. Stevens directed workers to dig from both ends of the lock site and meet in the middle. Each lock was 70 feet (21.3 m) deep and 110 feet (33.5 m) wide. Building these monster locks took four years.
Stevens, although highly successful, unexpectedly resigned from the project in 1907. Roosevelt then sent Major George Washington Goethals of the Army Corps of Engineers to Panama. Goethals took over as supervisor and oversaw the building of the canal. Much of Stevens’s work up to that point had involved preparation and excavation. Under Goethals’s command, actual construction could begin on the canal’s three sets of locks. Work crews also began building Gatun Dam across the powerful Chagres River. When workers finished the canal in 1914, the locks worked just as planned. The Panama Canal soon became an important navigation route.
The United States controlled the canal until the end of 1999, when Panama took it over as part of a treaty agreement. By the early twenty-first century, the canal was showing its age. More than fourteen thousand ships and three hundred million tons of cargo were passing through its locks annually. It badly needed a makeover to allow it to handle larger ships and resolve the problem of traffic jams. In 2006, the people of Panama voted to build two new sets of locks and two new navigation lanes to connect those locks to the existing channels.
In 2016, forty-thousand workers completed the $5.4 billion, ten-year construction project. The new locks allow much larger ships to pass through the canal, effectively doubling the amount of cargo it can handle each day. The expansion is yet another marvel of engineering in the canal’s long history.",1030.0

In the early 1800s, treasure hunters flocked to the valley in droves. Like early tomb robbers, they removed anything of value to sell to wealthy collectors. That changed in 1857, when the Egyptian government established the Antiquities Service to protect the country’s ancient monuments and artifacts. As a result, today’s explorers use techniques designed to protect and preserve the tombs and their contents. A special department of the United Nations designated the Valley of the Kings one of the first World Heritage sites in 1979. Over a million people visit the tombs each year.
Eighteen tombs are open to the public on a rotating schedule and, with the exception of Tutankhamen’s tomb, visitors can see any three of the open tombs with their entry ticket. (Tutankhamen’s tomb requires purchase of an additional ticket. The treasures originally found in Tutankhamen’s tomb are housed in the Cairo Museum of Antiquities.)People who accidentally touch the walls can discolor or damage the ancient paint and carvings. The rotating schedule of open tombs gives each tomb regular breaks from the crowds. Scheduled closures also provide time for tomb restoration and maintenance. Experts hope this will counter the effects of keeping the tombs open to the public.
For decades after Howard Carter’s sensational discovery of Tutankhamen’s tomb, the Valley of the Kings yielded few new secrets. That changed in 1989, when Egyptologist Kent Weeks took a closer look at a tomb (KV 5) previously labeled “uninteresting.” Clearing flood debris from the tomb revealed a previously undiscovered corridor leading to at least 150 chambers. The Valley of the Kings is one of the richest archaeological sites in the world. If experts are correct, there is more history to be uncovered.",1072.0
" It appeared that the sea inside the fog was bubbling and choppy, while the sea outside was calm. People claim that a mysterious power causes the many losses of ships and crews in the Bermuda Triangle. Christopher Columbus claimed to have seen strange white lights on the horizon, and his compass malfunctioned. Because weird lights are seen there, some think that UFOs capture humans and take them away.
Others say the unexplained losses are a result of the severe weather natural to the area. Hurricanes and violent waterspouts blow up suddenly, and tidal waves are common. The Gulf Stream, which flows through the Triangle, is known to cause violent atmospheric changes. Any vessel that is destroyed would wash away without a trace. Some of the missing crews, when rescued later, tell stories of being forced to leave their storm-damaged ships. Some say that nothing unusual is going on in the area and that more strange accidents happen there simply because it is one of the most heavily traveled areas of the ocean. They also suggest that some of the losses blamed on the Bermuda Triangle actually happened hundreds of miles away. Other vessels that have been reported lost showed up later. Some vessels claimed to have been lost in the Triangle existed solely in the imaginations of storytellers. Do you think the Bermuda Triangle is real or a hoax?

"S. ships in order to keep supplies from reaching their enemies. The British also seized the British-born American sailors on the ships they took, forcing them to serve as British sailors and making U.S. citizens who had gained independence from Britain subject to Great Britain’s tyranny again. In 1812, President Madison told Britain to cease searching and seizing U.S. ships or there would be war. Not satisfied with the response, Madison declared war with Britain on June 18, 1812.The United States did not have the navy to fight Britain on the seas. An invasion to conquer British-controlled Canada failed, proving the army was not ready to take on the powerful nation again. For two and a half years, the United States remained at war with Britain. On December 24, 1814, the two countries signed the Treaty of Ghent, agreeing to end the war.
Even though the war had officially ended, the United States engaged in one more battle against the British. On January 8, 1815, Americans decisively won the Battle of New Orleans under General Andrew Jackson, who was unaware a peace treaty had been signed. Almost three hundred British soldiers died in what was one of the worst defeats suffered by the British. The U.S. death toll was less than twenty men. The victory at the Battle of New Orleans made it clear that the United States, not Great Britain, truly controlled the western portion of the country. It also made U.S. citizens feel as if their new country had won the War of 1812, although, in truth, neither country was victorious. Maybe the most important outcome was that the late victory made the new United States of America feel truly united as one nation.",1160.0
" While some neighbors welcomed back their Japanese American friends, many communities met the returnees with distrust and discrimination.
Many Japanese Americans carried deep emotional and psychological scars. Many urged their children to excel in school and at work to protect themselves from being victimized again. For decades afterward, most other Americans forgot about this unjust chapter in U.S. history. That began to change in the 1970s as more survivors spoke about their experiences. In 1981, the U.S. Congress formed a commission that found no evidence of any anti-American espionage or sabotage carried out by a Japanese American or Japanese immigrant during the war. In 1991, on the fiftieth anniversary of the Pearl Harbor attack, President George H.W. Bush issued another formal apology: “No nation can fully understand itself... if it does not look with clear eyes at all the glories and disgraces, too, of the past.... The internment of Americans of Japanese ancestry was a great injustice, and it will never be repeated.
Japanese Americans have continued to remind their fellow citizens of that commitment. Since World War II, some Americans have called for rounding up other groups in the United States and repeating the same injustice. Survivors of the incarceration camps have been some of the loudest voices urging that this must never happen again—to any group. Actor and activist George Takei, whose family was incarcerated in Arkansas when he was five, called the mass incarceration of Japanese Americans, “a decision steeped in racism, war hysteria, and lack of political leadership.” He added, “We must never repeat the mistakes of the past. To hold to this, our civic leaders must not only stand up to fearmongering, they must also understand our history so it does not ever repeat.”",1174.0
" A 2014 feature film about him, The Theory of Everything, garnered high acclaim. Hawking was also featured in the opening ceremony of the 2012 Paralympic Games in London. In his speech, he gave a nod to the scientific tradition of gathering knowledge from direct observation and encouraged the audience to stay curious about the universe.
During his last years, Hawking worked at the University of Cambridge as director of research in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics. He was also the founder of the Centre for Theoretical Cosmology. He taught and mentored students and continued to explore questions about the nature of the universe.
Stephen Hawking asked big questions about the nature of the universe and opened up new worlds of scientific thinking. Many of his ideas have stood the test of time, though others have not. Nevertheless, he was always eager to take on topics that don’t have easy answers and to model rigorous and fearless scientific inquiry. In doing so, he fueled a wealth of scientific research by inspiring other researchers to explore his ideas as well as ask their own questions. In addition to his remarkable scientific contributions, Hawking was an inspiration for his unbridled zest for life. His mind was so brilliant and unstoppably curious that even with the severe limitations of his illness, he felt compelled and determined to continue to find meaning and purpose in living. Stephen Hawking was born on the three hundredth anniversary of Italian astronomer Galileo’s death, and he died on Albert Einstein’s birthday. It is fitting that Hawking shared such important dates in his life with two scientists who also revolutionized our ideas about the universe.",1223.0

The sled swayed and trembled, half-started forward. One of his feet slipped, and one man groaned aloud.

" These robots may look like people, but so far they are not very good at acting like people.One problem is that it’s hard for robots to do many different things the way people can. In fact, the more automatic a task is for a human, the harder it is to program a robot to do it. Each of us learned to walk, but after that, we do it by instinct.
To get around this problem, scientists begin by programming a robot to only deal with one very simple task, such as rolling or walking on many legs. Then they add other simple programs one by one until the robot can do many different tasks successfully. This idea began with robots that imitate insects. These tiny bug-bots move and react just like insects and can send signals to each other. Several companies have built robot dogs as expensive toys and companions. These dogs bark, move, and perform tricks. More advanced models can recognize their owners’ voices and faces, and respond with actions or flashing lights.
True artificial intelligence, or AI, involves human-level intelligence. It involves the ability to learn, react to new information, and make decisions independently. Scientists are still working on creating computers and robots with real AI. Some robots are able to adjust their own programming as they gain experience. This kind of machine learning allows robots to improve the way they work over time.
Robots are already a big part of modern life, and they are becoming more common every day. Robots work in many factories, vacuum people’s homes, and mow their lawns. In some areas, robots deliver meals from restaurants or fly through the sky carrying packages from online stores. As robots continue to improve, we can expect them to keep changing the way we work and live.",1031.0

" But humans are increasingly encroaching into elephant habitats. Humans build roads, plant crops, cut down trees, and construct houses in territories where elephants once roamed freely. At one time, elephants lived in nearly every part of Africa and across South Asia. Today, they are restricted to a small fraction of that territory. Poaching is another challenge. Even though many countries have laws protecting elephants, hunters continue to slaughter them for their ivory tusks. Ivory is especially popular in China, where it’s carved into art. Some people believe ivory objects bring good luck, even though methods for getting ivory are tragic for the elephant. Humans and elephants have a long history together. Some studies report that ancient armies used elephants in battle. Asian elephants have been used to move trees and other heavy objects throughout history. Elephants have been kept and studied in zoos for hundreds of years. However, today many experts argue that zoo environments rarely meet elephants’ needs. Their natural family structures are not supported and due to their high intelligence, elephants are likely to be bored and stressed in captivity. Animal welfare activists fight to have zoo elephants moved to sanctuaries where they can live a more natural existence.

Why Hockey?
Hockey is a challenging sport to play, but by learning the rules and practicing, committed young players can become skilled. They need to be good skaters, and even if they are, they must be prepared for serious bruises. Yet if hockey is so challenging, why are millions of people of all ages hooked on it? Jeremy Rupke coaches hockey and maintains a website to help players improve their skills. In his words, “Hockey is a fast-paced, action-packed game that requires quick thinking, communication, and a lot of skill. Everyone works together as a team for a common goal. Hockey is a great way to have fun, challenge yourself, and make a lot of new friends.” “Perhaps one of the greatest feelings in hockey is when the game starts and everything else in your life stops. Once the puck hits the ice, all your worries disappear. It’s just you and the game.”",1035.0
" Heartbroken, Odysseus watched helplessly as his home began fading away in the distance. With no sails on the ship and no way to steer, Odysseus and his men were being blown over the furious seas away from Ithaca, back in the direction from which they’d come. Oh, weak man! Why did I let myself sleep? Odysseus cried to himself. Hours from home, and now this! He prayed to Poseidon, god of the seas, to calm the waves, and to Zeus, god of the sky, to end the storm. However, his prayers went unanswered. The gods had other things in store for Odysseus, and he would not see his home for many more years.
Driven by the howling winds, Odysseus and his men cowered in fear onboard their ship, helpless to sail in the storm. Eventually, they ended up back at Aeolus’s island. “Odysseus, why are you here?” Aeolus asked, as the men came ashore. With great shame, Odysseus told Aeolus what happened with the bag of winds. “It was not my fault,” he said. “It was my men.” He pleaded with Aeolus to help him once again. However, despite Odysseus’s desperate pleadings, Aeolus was firm. “Surely the gods have decided to test you, Odysseus,” he said. “To be turned away after getting so close to home can only mean the gods are against you, and I cannot go against the gods’ wishes. Good luck to you, wise Odysseus. I cannot help you again.” Aeolus was right. Odysseus would suffer much bad luck, and struggle mightily, before he would finally reach Ithaca.

" Sacagawea said he was too young but that he could go in a year. After leaving, Clark wrote a letter to Charbonneau thanking him for Sacagawea’s service. For such a long and dangerous journey, Clark wrote, she deserved a greater reward than they could offer her when they parted.
Lewis and Clark were heroes back in Washington, D.C. Congress gave each member of the party extra pay as well as land. When Charbonneau heard about the rewards, he took Sacagawea and Pomp, now four, to St. Louis, where Clark lived, in the fall of 1809. Pomp stayed in St. Louis with Clark, while Charbonneau and Sacagawea left after two years to join another expedition in present-day South Dakota. Sacagawea gave birth to a daughter, Lisette, in August 1812. Four months later, at about age twenty-five, Sacagawea died of a fever. The following summer, the fort’s clerk, John Luttig, took Lisette to join Clark and Pomp in St. Louis. Clark became the legal guardian of both children.
We don’t know much about Sacagawea, but we do know that she traveled thousands of miles and survived extreme conditions as part of the Lewis and Clark expedition. She found food, served as an interpreter, and reassured the people they encountered that the expedition had peaceful intentions. Sacagawea’s life has been the subject of myths that exaggerate her contributions, yet her real contributions were impressive enough. She came from the humblest of beginnings as a female Native American in the 1700s who was kidnapped and sold. She showed sufficient character and courage in difficult circumstances to prompt two famous explorers to write about her. The fact that we continue to tell her story and create art to honor her is evidence of her contributions. Sacagawea left a lasting mark on American history.",1112.0

Because of her suspension, Yanyan, one of the top swimmers in the world at the time, was not allowed to compete in the 2000 Olympic Games.
Steroid use among teens is a major problem. One study suggests that 6 percent of middle school and high school boys and 5 percent of girls use steroids. The Centers for Disease Control reports that 5.3 percent of high school girls admit to using anabolic steroids. When teens are caught using steroids, they are usually no longer allowed to play sports, and they can even be kicked out of school. This one poor choice in middle or high school can cause problems for a person’s entire future. Researchers say teens take steroids because they are influenced by the media’s perception of a beautiful body. They also take steroids because of the highly competitive nature of school sports. Many student athletes hope steroids will give them an edge to win. Unfortunately, in an attempt to enhance their physical appearance or abilities, they damage the very thing they are trying to improve—their bodies.
Steroids change who you are. In an effort to gain a competitive edge or just larger muscles, the body and mind transform—and this transformation comes at a price. By using steroids, athletes at all levels run the risk of being labeled cheaters. They tear apart their bodies and minds to earn an artificial victory. In the end, they are left with terrible side effects that may never subside as well as the knowledge that everything they achieved was just “one big lie.”",1108.0
" To this day, judges and barristers in the United Kingdom court system wear wigs as part of their uniforms. Toupees came into fashion during the eighteenth century, too. While still ornately curled and powdered, they had one major advantage—they were much cooler and lighter. Full wigs were extremely hot to wear as well as quite heavy. In 1795, the English government imposed a tax on both wigs and wig powder. The tax only lasted a few years, but raised a lot of money for the government. However, the tax also caused the end of the wig-wearing trend in Britain. By the 1850s, many people in Europe had stopped wearing wigs. Common people often saw them as an unnecessary luxury that only the aristocracy could afford. Some enterprising people collected old wigs and sold them in the streets for small sums of money. People bought them to use as floor mops and polishing rags.
Hair Today, Gone Tomorrow?
As technology improved in the twentieth century, people began to create wigs out of nylon threads, which resembled real human hair but cost quite a bit less. Nylon also allowed for a larger color selection—wigs could be any color of the rainbow, which gave people access to an even greater variety of looks and locks. Today, people continue to wear wigs for many reasons. They wear them to appear fashionable and stylish or simply to change their appearance. People who are bald or losing their hair wear wigs to boost self-esteem. Performers such as clowns or actors might wear wigs as part of their costumes. Styles have changed, depending on the fashion of the time, but whether they are long or short, fancy or plain, wigs have played an important role in human history. Who knows what the next great fashionable hairstyle will be?",1060.0
" Ranji was also an important political figure. He represented India in the League of Nations, the predecessor of the modern United Nations.
Sir Donald Bradman (1908-2001) was a legendary Australian cricketer known as the best Test batter of all time. Bradman had a Test batting average of 99.94, meaning he almost never missed. To put that in perspective, the next best cricket batter ever has an average of 60.97. After World War II, Bradman served as captain of an Australian team nicknamed “the Invincibles.” The Invincibles went on a record-breaking tour of England, playing an undefeated series of thirty-four matches (playing 112 days of a 144-day tour). Since 1889, each year five cricket players are named as Cricketers of the Year by Wisden, a cricket publication. In 2009, Claire Taylor (1975–) became the first woman to win the honor. In college, Taylor played on the men’s cricket team, developing a batting style that was more typical of the men’s game than the women’s. She made the leap to professional women’s cricket and became one of the finest batters the game has seen.
Nice Match!
So just how did cricket become an international phenomenon? The history of the British Empire and ongoing development of new and exciting playing styles certainly played an important part, but perhaps the answer lies in cricket’s two most compelling features. When a cricket player is at bat, it does not matter who that player is or where he or she came from; all players compete as equals on the field. Furthermore, by cricket tradition, every player deserves the same level of respect. It could be that cricket became popular with players and spectators around the world because its values—equality and respect—are values everybody can share.",1125.0

People from around the world enjoy Moroccan food, which contains elements of Spanish, French, Berber, and Arab cuisines. One of the Moroccan main dishes is couscous, which is a tiny round pasta. As in other Arab countries, people serve bread with meals. Moroccans use a special clay pot called a tagine (tah-ZHEEN) to cook many dishes. The word tagine appears in the names of dishes people cook in this type of pot. Meat is plentiful in Morocco and is featured in dishes such as kebobs of many varieties and a lamb stew that people serve during the holy month of Ramadan. Another popular meat dish is b’stillah (buh-STI-lah), which is a pastry filled with pigeon meat and topped with sugar. People also eat fish regularly in coastal areas. Tomatoes, onions, peppers, and eggplant are hallmark vegetables of Moroccan cuisine. The flavors of garlic, olives, lemons, and spices such as saffron, cumin, coriander, and cinnamon are often present in Moroccan food. People often wash down their meals with mint tea or black coffee.
Morocco is a land with an ancient history, filled with snowy mountains, sunbaked desert dunes, and inviting beaches. The different areas are home to a variety of interesting animals. Due to its location, tourists to this unique land find Morocco a bridge to Africa as well as a gateway to Europe. Morocco stands out in the region for its mild climate in the north, its strong ability to grow crops, its reforms regarding gender equality, and its delicious, world-famous cuisine.",1047.0
" Spider-Man and Batman comics, to use two familiar examples, have been challenged in some communities because of adult language or themes. Readers, teachers, and librarians have discussed censorship on panels at several recent comic cons. One result of these discussions has been the rise of the labels “graphic novel” and “graphic memoir” to describe comic books that are intended for adult audiences. Some comics are still aimed at children, but comics as a whole are no longer “kids only.” Some comics are fictional and some aren’t; some are educational, and some are meant for entertainment. Some deal with adult themes, while others provide an escape into fantasy worlds. Since comics are diverse, should all comics be shelved together in libraries and schools? What role do comics have in our larger society? These questions are frequent topics at comic con panels.
The expansion of the comic book landscape can be challenging, but overall it’s an exciting time for comic cons. The huge diversity of the comics available today has resulted in bigger, more diverse audiences for comics and conventions. Fans of every age, gender, and nationality can find themselves represented in a comic somewhere. Heroes might look like Superman, a young girl from Botswana, or a reporter on the ground in Bosnia. There is no limit to what can happen in a comic book or who can be its heroes. In the end, this is what draws people to comic cons. The cons (and the fictional stories that inspire them) create worlds where ordinary people can be transformed into heroes. People lose themselves in possibility every time they dress up as a favorite character, trade books and trivia questions with fellow fans, and shake hands with an artist at a comic con. Many people return to that experience over and over.",1056.0

The Tokyo Imperial Palace plays a very important role in modern-day Japan. The emperor performs many of his state duties, such as receiving foreign officials and awarding honors, at the Imperial Palace. In addition to its governmental importance, the Imperial Palace is a popular site for tourists and Tokyo residents alike. Many joggers enjoy running a route around the palace grounds, and the palace offers a quiet spot for reflection in the midst of fast-paced city life.
In the springtime, over 260 cherry trees burst into bloom, their delicate pink flowers stretching over the Chidori-ga-fuchi moat in the northwest area of the Imperial Palace grounds. This area is the most popular location for cherry blossom viewing in Tokyo. Over a million people visit the moat from late March to early April each year. Visitors can enjoy walking on a footpath beneath a canopy of cherry blossoms or marvel at the beauty while gliding along the waters in a rowboat. An important historic, cultural, and governmental site such as the Imperial Palace must be very carefully maintained. The Imperial Household Agency is in charge of running the palace grounds. The agency has about one thousand employees devoted to these tasks. It spends billions of yen (millions of U.S. dollars) each year; in 2016, the agency spent about 5.5 billion yen ($48 million U.S.) on palace expenses.
The Imperial Palace seems to be a place untouched by time. In the heart of bustling Tokyo, its lush grounds contain thick, impenetrable forests. Its serene gardens and graceful wooden buildings are a balm for weary souls. The palace grounds have been home to shoguns and emperors for centuries. As a cherished part of Japanese history and culture, they will no doubt be a beloved part of Tokyo life for generations to come.",1198.0

Law enforcement agencies are now building databases of DNA samples, much as they keep collections of fingerprints. These databases contain the DNA fingerprints of convicted criminals as well as other evidence found at crime scenes. DNA has even been used to free people who were wrongly convicted of crimes. DNA fingerprinting has helped solve many crimes since it was first used in 1985. However, some people are concerned about the possible contamination affecting the accuracy of DNA testing as well as its possible misuse. Even so, DNA fingerprinting will continue to be used as long as it helps identify criminals and solve crimes.
Genetics is used by many medical and health-care scientists. It is used to diagnose, treat, and prevent diseases as well as to develop new medicines. Medical scientists are now discovering many genes that cause specific diseases. By identifying genes that cause a specific disease, scientists can develop medicines and vaccines to cure or prevent the disease by targeting the treatments to those specific genes. Genetics counselors also use genetics to help parents and future parents figure out the odds of passing on genetic disorders to their children. Parents use this information to help them decide whether to have children or how to cope with the possibility of caring for children with genetic disorders. Some common genetic disorders that may be passed on from parents to their children are cystic fibrosis, Huntington’s disease, and breast cancer.
The field of genetics offers many job opportunities. Genetics is an exciting and relatively new branch of science that brings new developments and new opportunities almost daily. Whether in plant and animal breeding, medicine, criminology, or some other field, career opportunities linked to genetics abound.

" If the money or credit is there, the money is withdrawn from the person’s account and deposited into the store’s, restaurant’s, or company’s account. It is easier to carry around one piece of plastic than it is to carry many bills. Since cards have the account holder’s name and information on them, the money is harder to steal than bills are. Credit and debit cards make a person’s money more secure. If the cards are lost or stolen, a phone call to the bank can cancel them and new cards can be issued. That system is impossible with cash.
However, credit cards can be dangerous because people forget that they must pay back the money they borrowed. Many people who use credit cards irresponsibly owe so much money to the banks that the banks take back, or repossess, the things the person bought. If that happens, a negative note is made on the person’s credit history, and he or she may not be able to borrow again for a long time. Plastic cards are less visible than money, but they can buy the same goods. Our invisible money allows us to trade with people around the world. With the help of catalogs and the Internet, people can use credit cards to buy goods from a person or company in another country. The money is automatically changed into a currency the other person can use.
Three thousand years ago, people bartered to trade goods or services with each other. Today, people trade with each other using bills, coins, checks, and even invisible money such as debit and credit cards. What sort of money do you think we’ll have in another three thousand years?",991.0
" This wind pushes water up the Adriatic Sea into the lagoon. When a strong acqua alta occurs, city squares and businesses end up soaked.
To combat this, the city has been working to install seventy-eight mobile floodgates into the lagoon. These gates rest on heavy concrete foundations. When a high tide is looming, authorities will be able to raise the floodgates and seal off the lagoon from the sea. The gates will then protect the city against tides almost 3 meters (10 ft.) high. They are expected to handle sea level concerns over the next century.
Most research looks at the impacts of global warming by 2100. Yet one of the biggest impacts for humans will be long-term sea level rise. It will last twice as long as human history—but today’s humans can help change the course of history. Scientists have determined that the most effective way we can combat sea level rise is by curtailing our emission of gases that warm the atmosphere, in particular the main culprit: carbon dioxide. This is easier said than done. The growing world population consumes energy at an ever-increasing rate. And when governments fail to pass legislation that would reduce emissions, it makes this goal even harder to accomplish.
Meanwhile, to keep people and property safe in the future, both planners and ordinary citizens must prepare now. Some places have begun; others don’t appear to have clear plans in place. As the seas rise on coastal people, those of us on higher, drier ground have to wonder: What can we do to help avert this crisis? It’s a compelling question.

" He remarried, this time to a woman named Deianira. However, this marriage was also ill-fated. When Hercules and his new wife were traveling, a centaur named Nessos offered to transport Deianira across a deep river while Hercules made his own way. Midway across the river, Nessos began to assault Deianira. Upon hearing his wife’s desperate and panicked screams, Hercules swiftly shot off an arrow that he had dipped into the poisonous blood of the Hydra, one of the monsters that he had conquered during his labors. As Nessos bled to death, he rubbed his cloak into his blood, which had mixed with the poison. Offering his cloak to Deianira, he whispered, “In the future, if your husband ever wrongs you, give him this cloak, for it has been soaked in a special love potion.”
Later, when Hercules and Deianira had become alienated from each other, she remembered the cloak. She gave it to Hercules, who wrapped himself in it, only to be instantly seized with unendurable pain. Wild with agony and unable to wash the poison from his skin, Hercules commanded a great pyre to be built and lay down in the midst of the flames, hoping to perish and end his torment. Zeus looked down upon the pyre from his home on Mount Olympus and was deeply moved. Turning to his wife, Hera, he said, “Has he not suffered enough? Let your anger be stilled.” Hera bowed her great head and consented. After all, he was a son of Zeus, and he had demonstrated that he was mighty and courageous beyond human expectations. The gods raised Hercules up, and he ascended in a pillar of fire to Mount Olympus, where he lived as a demigod forevermore.",1132.0

Don’t Swim There!
Electric eels are top predators and are common in their environments, which are usually muddy or sandy slow-moving rivers. Scientists have found them in the Amazon and Orinoco Rivers and their tributaries in northern South America. Because electric eels prefer slow-moving or calm fresh water, they can also be found in swamps, creeks, and ponds or along the edges of lakes in tropical plains or forests. Because they breathe air, electric eels can survive in water with little oxygen and even out of water for hours as long as their skin stays wet.
Electric eels mostly mate in small ponds. Male eels build nests by creating bubbles with their saliva, and female eels lay hundreds of eggs in the bubbles. Male eels guard the nests and the hatched baby eels until they are about 10 centimeters (3.9 in.) long. Then the baby eels have to start defending themselves with their shocking abilities, which aren’t as powerful as an adult’s. Young electric eels are vulnerable to animals, such as crocodiles, that might risk preying on them before they grow larger.
Scientists understand more about electric eels now than Humboldt did, but researchers are not yet done learning. Scientists at Yale University are looking at electrocytes as a model for cells to replace batteries in medical devices—such as pacemakers, which keep a human heart beating. Pacemaker batteries contain chemicals that could poison a patient if the device breaks. Researchers want a battery that won’t harm the insides of a human body and won’t run out of power. What Humboldt wrote more than two hundred years ago could still apply today: “We are, doubtless, very far from having discovered all the secrets of the electrical action of fishes.” What will electric eels help scientists understand next?",1167.0

A carriage drove up one day and stopped before the house. When the footman dismounted from the box and opened the door the gentleman who was the father of the Large Family got out first. After him there descended a nurse; then came down the steps two men-servants. They came to assist their master, who, when he was helped out of the carriage, proved to be a man with a haggard, distressed face, and a skeleton body wrapped in furs. He was carried up the steps, and the head of the Large Family went with him, looking very anxious. Shortly afterward a doctor’s carriage arrived, and the doctor went in. “There is such a yellow gentleman next door, Sara,” Lottie whispered at the French class afterward. “Do you think he is a Chinee?

" Today, soccer is a worldwide phenomenon whose appeal continues to grow.
Soccer has had a wealth of gifted players over the years. Pelé is widely considered the greatest soccer player in the history of the sport and is the only player ever to have played on teams that won the World Cup three times. Playing as striker for Brazil’s national team, he was active from 1956 to 1977, scoring 1,281 goals in 1,363 matches, a world record that still stands. Pelé’s gifts included an amazing talent for anticipating players’ movements. Playing as a forward for seventeen years, Mia Hamm helped the United States win the first FIFA Women’s World Cup in 1991 as well as the 1999 Women’s World Cup. She won gold medals at the 1996 and 2004 Summer Olympic Games and was included on FIFA’s 2004 list of the “125 Greatest Living Soccer Players.” In addition to her formidable soccer triumphs, Hamm has also been a powerful role model for girls aspiring to succeed in sports.
World Cup soccer is far from the only way to play the game. Some players choose futsal, a fast-paced indoor version of soccer. Others prefer to play on the shore and choose beach soccer. Most players, however, prefer something a little more traditional and opt for old-fashioned soccer. There are many ways for students to get involved. They can find out if their city or town has a soccer organization with teams for different age groups. Coaches will help young players build handling skills and learn offensive and defensive strategies.

Detroit ended up winning that year, and the octopus was considered good luck. This strange Detroit tradition continued for years. In one 1995 game, fans threw thirty-six octopuses onto the ice. In yet another 1995 playoff game, two fans tossed a 38-pound (17.2 kg) octopus onto the ice. The next year, a 50-pound (22.7 kg) octopus was thrown onto the ice. This crazy tradition continues today!
The Edmonton Oilers could have been mistaken for an All-Star Team from 1983 to 1990. Led by “The Great One,” Wayne Gretzky (GRET-ski), the team won five Stanley Cups during those years.

" Their sounds, which are louder than a jet engine, can travel for miles through the water. Yet even though whale sounds are powerful, they are difficult for people to hear since they are produced at extremely low frequencies. The frequencies are too low for the human ear to detect without special equipment. Some scientists think blue whale sounds, or songs, function as a type of sonar that allows the whales to navigate dark ocean waters. Other scientists think that these whales sing to communicate with each other about where they are and what they’re doing.
Researchers know that only male blue whales sing. They have also found that whales in one part of the world sing songs that are slightly different from songs sung by whales elsewhere. In calm seas, their songs can be detected by other blue whales up to 1,000 miles (1,600 km) away. The blue whales of the Indian Ocean have the most musical and versatile songs, producing four separate “notes” as they sing.
Blue whales continue to fascinate researchers around the world. In the early to mid-twentieth century, so many blue whales were hunted that they were nearly driven to extinction. Blue whales also face other dangers, including collisions with ships in the open ocean. As an endangered species, these whales are protected under the International Whaling Commission. However, hunting bans remain hard to enforce, and the blue whale population has yet to fully recover. Marine biologists and other scientists study migration movements and feeding patterns in order to better understand how these giants of the deep live and what they can teach us about life and survival in the ocean. By monitoring environmental and human-related threats, the goal of keeping blue whales safe from harm and helping their numbers rebound may still be achieved.",1156.0

After the Columbia space shuttle was launched in 1981, satellite rescue missions became easier. Technology on board the shuttles improved the chances of success. Manned Maneuvering Units, which looked like legless chairs strapped to an astronaut’s back, allowed astronauts to move freely outside the spacecraft without being tied to the shuttle. Robotic arms could snag satellites and retrieve them for use in different orbits. Since the U.S. Shuttle program shut down in 2011, NASA has tested and researched new techniques and equipment to ensure that there are other options for repairing satellites in orbit.
Space is a busy place, especially with space junk and thousands of aging satellites in low-Earth orbit. Currently there is no international law that says old satellites must be removed from their orbit. Objects in orbit above 500 miles (804 km) can stay there for thousands of years! Over time, satellites in some orbits get pulled back into Earth’s atmosphere where they most often burn up before reaching the ground. NASA and other agencies are working with innovative ideas to get rid of aging satellite traffic in space.
Satellites are clearly here to stay. Continually evolving satellite technology will continue to change our lives even more in the future. One recent development is Internet Routing In Space (IRIS), which allows for more instant transfer of voice, video, and data communication to remote areas. Researchers have recently developed satellite-imaging programs that let farmers track herd animals or monitor water supplies and irrigation levels. Improving satellite technology adds greatly to scientific knowledge. Satellites make it possible for us to communicate information quickly to people all over the world. Satellite images help us to come up with better ways to protect our planet. Research satellites will continue to probe our galaxy, helping us unravel the mysteries of the universe.",1200.0
" It has been described as the grandest section, and because of the many renovations, it is the safest section to walk. Badaling is also the site of the Great Wall Museum, which has nine exhibition halls on topics related to history, construction, art, and culture. Other sections of the wall are less crowded than Badaling, and many are also considerably steeper.
Visitors lucky enough to explore the Great Wall should expect to do a lot of walking, climbing, and picture taking. They can also take a guided tour to learn about the wall’s history and construction. Cable car rides are available at some sections, and outdoor enthusiasts can hike from one section to another and camp overnight. Other adventures include a toboggan ride at Mutianyu and paragliding at Simatai. People with a taste for extreme sports can participate in the Great Wall Marathon, which is one of the most challenging marathons in the world. The event, which began in 1999, involves 2,500 runners from more than 60 countries.
Contrary to rumors, the Great Wall isn’t visible from space, but it’s still impressive. Its length is equal to almost half the distance around Earth’s equator. A new section was discovered in 2011 in Mongolia’s Gobi Desert. An expedition led by British explorer William Lindesay turned up a 100-kilometer (62 mi.) length of wall, one part made from blocks of volcanic rock and the other from mud and shrubs. Using carbon dating, scientists linked it to the Western Xia (SHEE-yuh) dynasty (1038–1227), which hadn’t been known to build walls before this discovery.

Now the reeds take it up—forget, forget, they sigh, and it dies away in a rustle and a whisper. Then the voice returns— “Lest limbs be reddened and rent—I spring the trap that is set—As I loose the snare you may glimpse me there—For surely you shall forget!

" The German counterattack, although a failure, prevented British troops from linking up with Canadian troops from Juno Beach that day as planned. While the British were unable to reach the town of Caen the same day, the mission was still considered a huge victory for the Allies. Allied forces managed to stabilize the beach, advance roughly 4 miles (6.4 km) inland, and repel the German counterattack before meeting up with the Canadians the following day. Allied troops would eventually capture the town of Caen six weeks later, on July 20, 1944.
Although the cost in Allied and Axis soldiers’ lives was high, Operation Overlord was a tremendous success. Through great sacrifice, Allied forces succeeded in gaining a foothold from which to begin to push back German forces and liberate occupied France. While this operation was a tremendous military victory for the Allies, it was also a day of mourning. Because of the large amount of activity on D-Day, it was difficult to record accurate casualty numbers on either the Allied or the Axis side. The term casualties does not exclusively mean deaths, but rather all losses suffered by the armed forces: killed, wounded, missing in action, and prisoners of war. Historians estimate that the Germans had between four thousand and nine thousand casualties, and the Allies had more than six thousand casualties on D-Day. The war dragged on for roughly another year as Allied troops continued to capture German-occupied territories in Europe. Germany finally surrendered on May 8, 1945, and Japan surrendered on August 15, 1945, to officially end the war. D-Day and the eventual liberation of France proved to be significant turning points in World War II.

" Caesar had a son with Cleopatra, and he restored her to the throne of Egypt. Caesar returned to Rome a triumphant hero. In 46, he declared himself dictator.
Caesar’s concentration of power enraged and frightened his opponents in the Senate. The Roman people had sworn that they would never again be ruled by a single monarch, but it seemed to them that Caesar was doing exactly that. In his short time as head of state, Caesar instituted many reforms: he updated the taxation system, began great public works, and expanded the Senate—padding it with his own supporters. A surprisingly lenient ruler, Caesar forgave many of those who had supported Pompey and even granted them important positions. Caesar meant to reform the republic, but the mixture of his perceived arrogance and his leniency led to his downfall. A group of senators conspired against him, and on March 15, 44, the Ides of March, they attacked and murdered Caesar.
Upon his murder, Caesar instantly became a martyr, and in 42 he was deified—declared a god. But the immediate aftermath of his assassination was chaos: the streets of Rome were awash with violence and, tragically, more civil war ensued. After years of conflict, Caesar’s great-nephew Octavian rose from the tumult to become Emperor Augustus Caesar—the first Roman emperor. During his judicious reign, the empire would largely stabilize. It is impossible to know what Caesar might have accomplished had he not been assassinated. This brilliant man of ceaseless energy set out to repair the broken republic, and in a sense he succeeded.

" Saladin’s brother negotiated a truce with Richard; Saladin and Richard never actually met. The truce, signed on September 2, 1192, lasted three years. Saladin’s terms were generous: he allowed the Franks to keep the coast between Tyre and Jaffa. The rest of the land, including Jerusalem, would be Muslim land, but Christians would be allowed free access to holy places. That truce ended the Third Crusade.
After the truce was signed, Saladin went home to Damascus. He died just six months later, on March 4, 1193, at age fifty-five or fifty-six. Because he never cared much for money or a lavish life, he gave everything away, so there was no money for a proper burial. He was later buried in a mausoleum built by his son in Damascus. After Saladin’s death, his family continued to rule over Egypt and nearby lands until 1250, when another group gained power. Jerusalem remained mostly under Muslim rule for centuries.
Saladin was, and continues to be, revered by the Muslim world for uniting them and for reclaiming Jerusalem for Islam. Despite the fact that Christians lost control of Jerusalem to him, many also held Saladin in high esteem. Regardless of religion, people recognized Saladin as a notable leader—fierce in battle and compassionate to friend and foe alike. He was highly regarded throughout Europe and the Middle East as a man of great integrity, intellect, and military skill who was generous to his enemies and who inspired respect in everyone he met. When Saladin was near death, he told his oldest son, “I have become as great as I am because I have won men’s hearts by gentleness and kindness.” Saladin set an example of an honorable leader during his lifetime, and he continues to set an example today.",1113.0
" He sent 700 British soldiers on a secret mission to seize the weapons on the night of April 18, 1775. Gage also planned to arrest the leaders of the rebellion, Samuel Adams and John Hancock, who were in Lexington, a town not far from Concord. A Patriot doctor, Samuel Prescott, discovered Gage’s plans and warned the militia that the British were coming. On the way to Concord, the British soldiers encountered a group of 70 militiamen waiting for them on the village green in Lexington. The British soldiers tried to walk past the militiamen, but an unordered shot rang out. No one is sure which side fired the first shot, but that shot started the Revolutionary War. It would later become known as “the shot heard ’round the world” as noted in a poem by Ralph Waldo Emerson called “Concord Hymn.” In the fighting that followed, eight militiamen died and ten were wounded, while the British suffered extensive losses and then continued on to Concord.
The British destroyed some supplies in Concord, but the Americans had moved most of their weapons, hiding them before the British arrived. Patriot leaders Hancock and Adams escaped arrest. The Massachusetts militia arrived at Concord with nearly 500 men. They attacked the exhausted British soldiers at Concord’s North Bridge and continued the attack the next day as the British soldiers began to march back to Boston. The militiamen hid behind trees and stone walls to fire upon the lines of British soldiers, just as the French and Native Americans had during the Seven Years’ War. The professional British soldiers were humiliated by their defeat at the hands of a ragtag group of quickly trained colonists. At Lexington and Concord, 273 British soldiers and 93 militiamen died. The Revolutionary War had begun.",1101.0
" His most conspicuous trait was an ability to scent the wind and forecast it a night in advance. No matter how breathless the air when he dug his nest by tree or bank, the wind that later blew inevitably found him to leeward, sheltered and snug.
And not only did he learn by experience, but instincts long dead became alive again. The domesticated generations fell from him. In vague ways he remembered back to the youth of the breed, to the time the wild dogs ranged in packs through the primeval forest and killed their meat as they ran it down. It was no task for him to learn to fight with cut and slash and the quick wolf snap. In this manner had fought forgotten ancestors. They quickened the old life within him, and the old tricks which they had stamped into the heredity of the breed were his tricks. They came to him without effort or discovery, as though they had been his always. And when, on the still cold nights, he pointed his nose at a star and howled long and wolflike, it was his ancestors, dead and dust, pointing nose at star and howling down through the centuries and through him.
And his cadences were their cadences, the cadences which voiced their woe and what to them was the meaning of the stiffness, and the cold, and dark. Thus, as token of what a puppet thing life is, the ancient song surged through him and he came into his own again; and he came because men had found a yellow metal in the North, and because Manuel was a gardener’s helper whose wages did not lap over the needs of his wife and divers small copies of himself.",1139.0
" But Buck possessed a quality that made for greatness—imagination. He fought by instinct, but he could fight by head as well. He rushed, as though attempting the old shoulder trick, but at the last instant swept low to the snow and in. His teeth closed on Spitz’s left foreleg.
There was a crunch of breaking bone, and the white dog faced him on three legs. Thrice he tried to knock him over, then repeated the trick and broke the right foreleg. Despite the pain and helplessness, Spitz struggled madly to keep up. He saw the silent circle, with gleaming eyes, lolling tongues, and silvery breaths drifting upward, closing in upon him as he had seen similar circles close in upon beaten antagonists in the past. Only this time he was the one who was beaten. There was no hope for him. Buck was inexorable . Mercy was a thing reserved for gentler climes. He maneuvered for the final rush. The circle had tightened till he could feel the breaths of the huskies on his flanks. He could see them, beyond Spitz and to either side, half crouching for the spring, their eyes fixed upon him. A pause seemed to fall. Every animal was motionless as though turned to stone. Only Spitz quivered and bristled as he staggered back and forth, snarling with horrible menace, as though to frighten off impending death. Then Buck sprang in and out; but while he was in, shoulder had at last squarely met shoulder. The dark circle became a dot on the moon-flooded snow as Spitz disappeared from view. Buck stood and looked on, the successful champion, the dominant primordial beast who had made his kill and found it good.",897.0
"” Most of the American bomber crews had no idea that pilots from 332nd were black; one of them even called it the “Army’s best-kept secret” of the war. The German pilots who learned to fear the fighting skills of the pilots of the red-tailed Mustangs called them the “Black Bird Men.”
In the final years of the war, the 332nd flew 200 bomber escort missions while losing less than 25 bombers in total to enemy aircraft. This was an incredibly low number of losses. Other fighter escort groups sometimes lost that many bombers to enemy fighters during a single mission!
By the end of the war, the Tuskegee Airmen had proved their courage, skill, and fighting abilities to everyone. They had destroyed 112 enemy aircraft in the air and another 150 on the ground, as well as damaging hundreds more. They also destroyed more than 950 railroad cars, trucks, and other vehicles and received hundreds of medals for their achievements. Just as importantly, they won the respect and gratitude of the white bomber crews whom they protected on mission after mission. These results came with a price. The Tuskegee Airmen lost sixty-six pilots to enemy attacks and accidents and had thirty-two pilots captured.
After fighting to free Europe from the Nazis, the Tuskegee Airmen returned home to a country that still treated them as second-class citizens. No welcome-home parades greeted these returning heroes. The military, however, took note of their amazing achievements. The Tuskegee Airmen had shown that racial segregation was an unfair system that could not claim to be based on real differences in ability. Their success was one reason that President Harry S. Truman decided to end segregation in the military in 1948. But the fight to win full civil rights for all Americans was just beginning.",1108.0
" Earvin “Magic” Johnson became famous on the court with the Los Angeles Lakers and the Olympic Dream Team. He amazed fans with his all-around mastery of the game, particularly his ability to pass the ball in surprising and skillful ways—almost as if it was magic! Michael Jordan is often regarded as the greatest player ever in basketball. Along with being one of the best defensive players and holding an impressive number of records, Jordan gained the nicknames “Air Jordan” and “His Airness” for his ability to leap into the air doing his famous slam dunks. In high school, media sensation and basketball superstar LeBron James led his team to three Ohio state championships. Immediately after graduating, he was picked to join the Cleveland Cavaliers, where he broke records as the youngest player in NBA history to be Rookie of the Year and score ten thousand career points. Often bullied as a child, Brittney Griner overcame her early difficulties to consistently break records and attract acclaim as one of the best female athletes in the sport. She stands 6 feet 8 inches (203 cm) tall and wears men’s size-seventeen shoes. George Mikan might have made basketball the sport of “big men,” but Griner has made it also the sport of “big women.”
Basketball has come a long way since its simple beginnings. Media coverage of the sport keeps fan interest peaked all year, and with basketball courts available in neighborhood parks, schools, and even in some driveways around the world, anyone who is interested in learning the game will find it easy to do. Schools and basketball clubs in communities everywhere supply options for practicing the sport or joining a team. Who knows where the next great basketball stars will come from?",1291.0

Jack Nicklaus, nicknamed the “Golden Bear,” is generally considered the greatest golfer in the history of the sport. During his professional career, from 1961 to 2005, he won over one hundred competitions, including a record-setting six Masters Tournaments among a total of eighteen majors. Patty Berg’s professional golfing career began in 1940, after she had already won twenty-nine amateur titles. As a professional, she won an impressive sixty tournaments and fifteen major titles, and as one of the founders of the LPGA and its first president, she helped open doors for women in professional golf. Eldrick Tont “Tiger” Woods is considered by many to be one of the greatest golfers currently playing. His talents were evident by the time he was eight, and he became a professional golfer in 1996 at the age of twenty. The following year, he won the Masters Tournament, becoming the youngest man to earn the title. He currently has more career victories on the PGA Tour than any other active player.
Golfers are aware of bunkers and ponds, but sometimes they encounter unexpected hazards as well. A baboon ran down a fairway at the 2014 Nedbank Challenge in South Africa, and a herd of kangaroos hopped around the course during the 2013 Women’s Australian Open. No doubt the most unusual setting ever was... the Moon! Astronaut Alan Shepard went to the Moon in 1971 and hit a few golf balls while he was there. Few players will ever experience golfing on the Moon or with baboons, but the ancient sport of golf is available to anyone with a club and a golf ball. With lots of practice, young players will learn what millions of golfers and at least one astronaut already know: golf is out of this world!",1153.0
" Raised in Manhasset, New York, on Long Island (an area with a longtime lacrosse culture), Jim excelled in the sport at Syracuse University and always saw the game as the ultimate outlet for his athleticism.
Like Jim Brown and Oren Lyons Jr., Gary Gait played for Syracuse University. Gary, along with his twin brother, Paul, broke almost every collegiate record there was to break. The two forever changed lacrosse play in terms of speed and trick ball handling. Gary went on to a successful career in both the National Lacrosse League and Major League Lacrosse, and he remains Syracuse’s all-time leading goal scorer. He currently coaches the women’s lacrosse team there. Jen Adams is the head coach of the women’s team at Loyola University in Maryland. Before that, this young Australian came to America and shattered many records in women’s lacrosse. She is famous for her speed and agility on the field, and for her great team play and sportsmanship. Jen scored a record 445 goal points playing for the University of Maryland Terrapins, and in 2009, she played for the Australian team at the Women’s Lacrosse World Cup.
For hundreds of years, First Nations people played the traditional game that became known as lacrosse. It was a deeply spiritual and political tradition for many tribes. Today, lacrosse lives on for people all around the world. Lacrosse is a fast-growing sport that more and more people are embracing. The speed of the game, its unique challenges, and the interactive team play make it simply irresistible to young athletes, and as a result, youth clubs are popping up across North America.

" Its grapefruit-sized seedpods, which are hard and tough, typically don’t break open when they hit the ground, even though they sometimes fall from 100 feet (30.5 m) or higher.
The agouti is one of the only animals in the forest with strong enough teeth and powerful enough jaws to break through a seedpod’s thick shell. The agouti eats some of the seeds and scatters others throughout the forest by burying them far from the parent tree. The seeds eventually sprout into trees, and the long process begins all over again. Mistletoe plants in the desert rely on a bird called a phainopepla (fay-no-PEHP-luh) to spread their seeds. The phainopepla loves to snack on the seeds, which are buried in the plant’s berries. The bird uses its beak to separate the skin from the berries and then disperses undigested seeds wherever it leaves its droppings.
The world would be a very different place without symbiotic relationships. Without the help that these natural partnerships provide, many species would be more vulnerable to predators and pests, more likely to be isolated in smaller patches of habitat, less apt to bloom and spread, or faced with fewer choices for food. Scientists are still learning about how these special relationships work and are discovering new ones all the time.
Each symbiotic relationship is a little different and provides each species with a slightly different benefit. What all symbiotic relationships have in common, though, is that each organism that participates in the relationship receives something that helps it in return. The end result is that fish, birds, humans, and all sorts of other living things on our planet have a better chance of surviving, reproducing, and living longer, healthier lives.",1167.0
" Some water boys thought it was a thrill working on the beams, but they quickly learned not to look down, but instead to look to the end of the beam.
Some people thought the Empire State Building would be struck by lightning and destroyed or that winds would batter and sway the top floors, causing people to fall. As for the lightning, during one summer, a scientist recorded lightning striking the mast forty-eight times without any damage. When a hurricane struck with winds up to 120 miles per hour (193.1 kmph), the top of the building did sway, but only a few inches, and no one fell. Disaster did strike, however, during World War II. It was a Saturday when the pilot of a U.S. Army Air Force bomber became disoriented in the fog and crashed it into the building. Fourteen people perished in the crash and the fire that followed, but the building stood strong.
The Empire State Building became the world’s tallest skyscraper when it was completed in 1931. It held that title for longer than any other building, until the World Trade Center took over as the tallest in 1971. The Empire State Building has been designated America’s favorite building and one of the Seven Wonders of the Modern World. Soon after the building’s fiftieth birthday in 1981, it was declared a landmark, which means it must be preserved to appear as it always has— with renovations and modernizations, of course, including air conditioning! Today, the world’s most famous office building is still a prominent feature of New York City’s skyline, proving that Al Smith was accurate when he declared that the building had been built for generations to come.",1148.0
" By 1962, the number of polio cases in the United States dropped to fewer than one thousand. Salk’s vaccine was effective but expensive to produce, so that year the United States approved Sabin’s live-virus vaccine, which was cheaper than the killed-virus vaccine and given on a sugar cube instead of in a series of shots. The last cases of naturally occurring polio in the United States were in 1979. Since most of the few remaining cases were caused by the live-virus vaccine, the United States decided to use only the killed-virus vaccine after 2000. Salk had not only developed the first polio vaccine, his vaccine finally eradicated the disease in the country.
In 1960, Salk founded the Salk Institute as a place for scientists to work for the good of humanity. He researched diseases such as cancer and HIV/AIDS until his death in 1995. Today, the Salk Institute does cutting-edge medical research and has produced several Nobel Prize winners. Salk did not receive a Nobel Prize. At the time, many in the science community agreed with Sabin when he said that Salk’s work was “pure kitchen chemistry. He didn’t discover anything.” Salk was the only major polio researcher never elected to the prestigious National Academy of Sciences. Time magazine named Salk one of the hundred most important people of the twentieth century. He brought together discoveries from decades of polio research and applied new ideas to create the first polio vaccine. He received thanks from his country and the rest of the world for saving thousands of children from the crippling disease. Salk believed that medical research should focus on making a difference for humankind, and he achieved his goal.",1150.0
" SpaceX created a crewed version of its Dragon capsule for moving people back and forth to space stations. Two other companies, Boeing and Blue Origin, also designed capsules that would go up on a rocket and splash down into the ocean at the end of the mission.
What if you wanted to visit space for more than a few minutes at a time? At least one company—Bigelow Aerospace—is working to make space hotels a reality. Bigelow is creating a “balloon habitat” that folds up into a rocket’s cargo area. When it is placed into orbit, the habitat expands and can be joined to other pieces. The company is working on a unit that will house six people in a space similar in size to the ISS. The skin of the Bigelow habitat is made of strong fabrics like Mylar or Kevlar. Building a space station out of fabric may seem strange, but Bigelow engineers say that the fabric will actually work better than metal. NASA is looking at buying one of these habitats to expand the ISS. While these blow-up habitats aren’t ready yet, Bigelow sent two empty test models into space in 2006 and 2007. If things go as planned, future inflatable habitats will be launched and assembled into the world’s first private space station.
The final flight of the space shuttle marked the end of one era in space. It also marked the beginning of an exciting new age of commercial spaceflight. Private companies around the world are working hard to bring their spacecraft designs from the drawing board to the real world. Companies will provide many new options for sending cargo and people into space and for staying in orbit for extended periods of time. Are you ready for the commercial space age?",1107.0

Physical exercise—especially exercise that raises your heart rate—also has brainwide benefits. Dr. Arthur Kramer is the director of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology at the University of Illinois, where he studies how exercise affects the brain. “Exercising is good for your body and your brain,” Kramer says. “Research has shown that children who regularly exercise have better memories and attention and often do better on school tests.”
Dancing is good for your brain because learning new steps and patterns makes the brain form new neural connections. It also calms the brain’s stress response, which lowers tension in the body and makes you a happier person. Sleep is another key to healthy brain function. According to Dr. Ken Paller, director of the Cognitive Neuroscience Program at Northwestern University, evidence suggests that your brain replays memories during sleep. That may help skills and information “stick” in your memory. However it works, it’s clear that getting too little sleep decreases your ability to learn and think.
Brain protection is the most important key to brain health. Shock-absorbing fluid, called cerebrospinal fluid, and a hard skull guard your brain against injury. If you land on concrete, though, a fall from only two or three feet can crack your skull or bruise your brain. Swelling or bleeding inside the skull quickly cuts off the brain’s blood supply—and your brain can survive only a few minutes without oxygen. Wearing a helmet during sports provides extra protection that may save your brain—and your life. Your brain may be the most important part of your body. Exercise, eat brain foods, get enough sleep, and wear protective headgear to help your brain operate smoothly for years to come!",1182.0

Because of the complexity of CCD, scientists have yet to pinpoint the cause and recommend a cure. Solving the case of the disappearing honeybees will likely require additional research. In the meantime, we can use the available knowledge to foster bee-friendly environments that will benefit plants, bees, and people. Honeybees benefit from access to a diversity of plant life; having a variety of native wildflowers means ample forage and longer foraging seasons. People can create honeybee sanctuaries in their yards—places full of blooming plants where bees can reduce their contact with pesticides and thrive in a natural environment. Reducing the need for bee transport is another way to reduce stress on honeybee populations. One way to do so is to establish a network of permanent local apiaries. Rooftop and backyard beekeeping is gaining popularity in many rural and urban neighborhoods. Cities such as Seattle, Chicago, San Francisco, and even New York have legalized private beekeeping. The bees visit parks and gardens, producing honey and pollinating native fruit trees and plants as they go.
Even commercial monoculture farmers can find small ways to help bees without sacrificing a productive harvest. Setting aside a small portion of their land to plants that would sustain bees all year long instead of just for a couple of weeks each year would help create a population of homegrown pollinators. Farmers could even investigate more organic means of pest control that would let them avoid using toxic chemicals to deal with pests. There is much we can do to help honeybees while scientists continue to unravel the mystery of colony collapse disorder. Honeybees are small but important contributors to the health and well-being of many other species, including humans. Taking action to protect them helps not only the bees but us as well.",1234.0
" In October, John also died, felled by dysentery while confronting Louis’s forces. John’s nine-year-old son, Henry III, then became king. In service to his fifth king, Marshal, now aged seventy, became regent to the young king, who was too young to understand the dangerous situation he was in. Henry relied on Marshal’s experience and guidance to bring the rebellion to an end. Nonetheless, the civil war continued. As regent, Marshal advised Henry to reissue the charter and prove to the barons that he was not like his father.
Marshal proved his worth to the English throne. In 1217, he brought the rebel barons to heel and ejected Prince Louis from England. Henry reissued the Great Charter, pacifying the barons who had doubted that his reign would differ much from John’s. They trusted Marshal’s word that the king would abide by the charter. Henry turned eighteen in 1225 and again reissued the Great Charter, thereby reinforcing his pledge to be a law-abiding ruler. Henry accepted that no one was above the law—not even the king of England. The charter was reissued one more time, in 1297, during the reign of Henry’s son, King Edward I.
The Great Charter became a powerful symbol of liberty and the principle that no one is above the law. It served as the basis for English Common Law with its clauses detailing that everyone must be treated as innocent until proven guilty and that everyone is entitled to a trial by a jury of their peers. Many of the ideas presented in the charter deeply influenced political thinking in Europe. More than five hundred years later, when the American colonies broke away from British rule to create the United States, many of those same ideas found new expression in the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights.",1179.0

The NASCAR engine is highly tested and finely tuned. It is able to operate at 200 mph for more than three hours. The engine has to keep maximum output and run efficiently and reliably. Many new and radical elements are used in these engines, and these developments may be included in road cars within a few short years.
NASCAR tires are made of several layers of rubber, fabric, and steel belts to increase strength. The tires are engineered to tolerate extreme speeds and temperatures. They have to be incredibly strong to prevent the risk of a tire blowout.
NASCAR tires are unlike road car tires in that they are not filled with air. Instead, they are filled with nitrogen because air expands under extreme temperatures, which changes the air pressure and makes tires unstable. Nitrogen is able to better withstand the extreme conditions of a NASCAR race and maintain tire pressure and performance.
NASCAR tires are made to stick to the track, enabling the car to corner at very high speeds. The combination of track shape, downforce, and sheer speed places a NASCAR tire under extreme stress in a race. Each tire only lasts for about 150 miles. Since speed is essential in NASCAR racing, all four tires need to be replaced while a car is in a pit stop. This can be done in less than 15 seconds.
Car designers are constantly looking for ways to alter a car’s aerodynamics to help with its cornering or to increase its speed.
Today, NASCAR cars move at incredible speeds on an asphalt track, but cars in the future of NASCAR may actually hover above the track. One thing is certain, we will always be fascinated with speed and the vehicles that can get somewhere the fastest.",1073.0
" Of course my grandfather and all the other Monkeys at once agreed to the condition, and that is how it happens that we are three times the slaves of the owner of the Golden Cap, whosoever he may be.”
“And what became of them?” asked Dorothy, who had been greatly interested in the story. “Quelala being the first owner of the Golden Cap,” replied the Monkey, “he was the first to lay his wishes upon us. As his bride could not bear the sight of us, he called us all to him in the forest after he had married her and ordered us always to keep where she could never again set eyes on a Winged Monkey, which we were glad to do, for we were all afraid of her. “This was all we ever had to do until the Golden Cap fell into the hands of the Wicked Witch of the West, who made us enslave the Winkies, and afterward drive Oz himself out of the Land of the West. Now the Golden Cap is yours, and three times you have the right to lay your wishes upon us.” As the Monkey King finished his story Dorothy looked down and saw the green, shining walls of the Emerald City before them. She wondered at the rapid flight of the Monkeys, but was glad the journey was over. The strange creatures set the travelers down carefully before the gate of the City, the King bowed low to Dorothy, and then flew swiftly away, followed by all his band.

" The small windows that remain in the ruins of El Caracol are aligned with the northernmost and southernmost positions of Venus.
Visitors to Chichén Itzá may find themselves among quite a crowd. The ruins are one of the most popular attractions in Mexico, with more than one million people touring the site each year. While visitors may still enter many buildings, access to some structures has been restricted for the safety of the ruins as well as the visitors. Since 2006, when a tourist died in a fall down one of the steep stairways of El Castillo, climbing the pyramid has been forbidden.
El Castillo still holds special excitement for visitors, though. Enormous crowds congregate at the site on the spring and fall equinoxes to observe an event carefully planned by Maya architects more than a thousand years ago. As the Sun sets, it strikes the edge of the pyramid at the perfect angle to cast triangular shadows on the side of one of the stairways. The movement of the Sun causes the shadows to slowly move down the stairway, creating the image of a slithering serpent. At the base of the stairs, the serpent’s body joins one of the immense snake heads carved out of limestone long ago.
While excavation at Chichén Itzá has revealed much, there is still a great deal to be learned. Only five years ago, archaeologists discovered jade beads, knives, animal bones, and ancient human remains in the Holtun cenote, not far from El Castillo. They also found evidence that the Maya may have built the pyramid to perfectly align with the Sun’s path over the cenote.

The Great Mosque holds a significant place in Djenné’s history and culture. As a result, its citizens have fought to preserve it. However, because the Great Mosque requires constant repairs and plastering, the structure underneath has gradually weakened. In 2006, architects declared that the mosque was in imminent danger of collapse. They began an extensive restoration program and asked the Djenné community to temporarily halt its annual repair. Unfortunately, this deprived the local people of an important tradition as well as a major tourist attraction that is essential to Djenné’s economy. The Crépissage de la Grande Mosquée festival resumed in 2012. Today, many of the world’s ancient mosques have been modernized with advances such as electrical wiring and indoor plumbing. Although the Great Mosque of Djenné has been equipped with a loudspeaker system, locals have opposed additional updates in favor of preserving the building, which is considered an important aspect of their culture and religion.
Foreign investors have offered to rebuild the mosque using concrete to replace the walls and to tile over the sand floor. Though these modifications would improve the mosque’s structure, they would remove an important tradition that unites the community of Djenné. When Djenné was made a World Heritage Site by the United Nations in 1988, it gained protections to help preserve the city’s history. The Great Mosque is prevented from undergoing significant modernizations. For the time being, Djenné’s inhabitants will continue to maintain their cultural heritage and their annual festival.",1102.0

Although breaking, graffiti art, and DJing are still present and vibrant, rap as a musical art form clearly broke away from the pack. In the beginning, the rapper was just a part of the hip-hop party. But once hip-hop records started becoming hugely popular, the rappers themselves became the stars. From the release of “Rapper’s Delight” by the Sugarhill Gang in 1979, rap’s first worldwide hit, through the present day, rap music has evolved and transformed in many different ways.
Although it has always been party music, even the earliest rappers used their skills to address serious social and political issues. “The Message,” released in 1982 by Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, described a blistering portrait of urban poverty and misery in the streets of New York. Now, rapping can be heard in everything from hard rock to country pop.
In the early 1980s, as rap records became popular around the world, hip-hop culture became a global phenomenon. Hip-hop took root in France, Mexico, South Africa, and Brazil. Breakdancing spread worldwide through news reports and the release of films such as Wild Style (1982) and Breakin’ (1984), especially in the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, Germany, France, Russia, and South Korea. To this day, hip-hop has become part of many aspects of popular culture globally, leaving a lasting mark.
What started at a young girl’s party in the South Bronx in 1973 has become a global phenomenon.

But ere he closed his eyes he let them wander round his old room, mellow in the glow of the firelight that played or rested on familiar and friendly things which had long been unconsciously a part of him, and now smilingly received him back, without rancour. He saw clearly how plain and simple—how narrow, even—it all was; but clearly, too, how much it all meant to him, and the special value of some such anchorage in one’s existence. He did not at all want to abandon the new life and its splendid spaces; the upper world was all too strong, it called to him still, even down there, and he knew he must return to the larger stage. But it was good to think he had this to come back to; this place which was all his own, these things which were so glad to see him again and could always be counted upon for the same simple welcome.",1081.0

The tide of the war started to turn in favor of the Patriots in October when they won a battle at King’s Mountain, South Carolina, in a speedy sixty-five minutes. This battle was one of the few in the war that did not involve British soldiers—it was fought by Patriots against Loyalists. In January and April 1781, the Patriots again won battles at Cowpens and Camden, respectively. Next, they forced British General Charles Cornwallis north into Virginia. Cornwallis had aided the British victory at Long Island in 1776 and had taken command of British troops in the South in 1780. The Patriots’ alliance with the French began to pay off. French soldiers helped hold back the British and fought alongside colonists as part of the troops Washington led into Virginia.
The most important battle of the war was about to begin. A fleet of twenty-four French ships drove off nineteen British ships sent to rescue Cornwallis and his troops at Yorktown, on the coast of Virginia. The French fleet also brought extra soldiers to help the fight on land. The French and Patriot troops moved into Yorktown, laying siege to the British army for three weeks before they surrendered on October 19, 1781, thus ending the Revolutionary War. The Patriots had won their war and were now independent from Britain. The United States of America officially became independent from Great Britain with the Peace of Paris in 1783. The treaty granted to the United States all land in North America west to the Mississippi River with the exceptions of Canada (retained by Great Britain) and Florida (retained by Spain). Now a group of colonies that was accustomed to being supported by another country had to come together and build a brand new nation.",1142.0
" Some types, such as mini helicopters, make learning to fly easier, especially indoors, but they still require practice. Although these RC copters are small, they can teach pilots many of the skills necessary to fly bigger helicopters.
Quadrocopters, also known as quadcopters, have four spinning blades, usually at the corners of the vehicle, and can fly in all directions. Autogyros look like a cross between a plane and a helicopter. A propeller at the front or back moves the aircraft forward, which causes the unpowered blades on top to spin and keep the autogyro airborne. It’s a phenomenon called autorotation. One advantage of all the copters is that they don’t need a runway to take off or land.
RC technology isn’t just a hobby. Drones flown by pilots sitting miles away use the same basic technology and can perform various civilian and military tasks. Within the next few years, remote-controlled drones could be flying in your neighborhood. Farmers might soon be using camera-carrying drones to locate crop-damaging insects instead of having to physically inspect each field. Hospitals might use drones to transport human organs from one place to another for transplant. Some companies plan to use drones to deliver packages.
TV crews used drones to cover the 2014 Winter Olympic Games in Sochi, Russia. The drones, operated by the Olympic Broadcasting Service, flew across the ski and snowboarding courses. They captured amazing footage of the events without disrupting the performance of the athletes. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is creating new regulations for commercial drone operators that will preserve public safety. But those rules probably won’t affect hobbyists who fly for fun. What seemed like magic one hundred years ago is quickly becoming an important part of our everyday lives. It’s still a blast to play with as well!",1102.0

The entire jump took less than ten minutes, but it shattered two world records. Those ten minutes also provided scientists and engineers with huge amounts of data that they can now use to make high-altitude and space travel safer for astronauts, space tourists, and others. While Felix is proud of these achievements, the experience humbled him. Before those ten minutes began, before the records were broken, Felix stood on the edge of the capsule and said, “I know the whole world is watching now, and I wish the world could see what I see.

" “Number 42” was with the Dodgers for ten seasons, playing in six World Series for the team, which won the championship title in 1955. The baseball world observes Jackie Robinson Day each year on April 15.
Known as “the Pride of Puerto Rico,” baseball legend Roberto Clemente played right field for the Pittsburgh Pirates from 1955 to 1972. His home run in Game 7 of the 1971 World Series was decisive, as the Pirates defeated the Orioles 2-1 to capture the series championship. In 1972, Roberto was tragically killed in a plane crash. The following summer, he was elected the first Latin American player to be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. Derek Jeter is a modern baseball hero who is regarded as one of baseball’s greatest competitors. As a shortstop, Derek was a leader in scoring hits and runs in the American League and was a five-time World Series champion. When he retired from the game in October 2014, he remarked, “The thing that means the most to me is to be remembered as a Yankee.”
Baseball is a wonderful pastime, but it goes beyond that. Players of the game rely on sharp mental skills as well as physical strength. Some people believe that baseball is like life itself. On baseball teams, just as in life, everyone has a position to play, and players have to cooperate to be successful. Each year, with the onset of spring and warmer weather, a new baseball season begins. Baseball is not just for players, it’s also a diversion for millions around the world. It takes fans back to fond memories of childhood when they played T-ball, stickball, and softball. It embodies many of the great qualities of the human spirit—patience, perseverance, and the seizing of once-in-a-lifetime opportunities.",1061.0

If you’re lucky enough to be in Paris during a special event, you’ll enjoy an additional treat at the Eiffel Tower—a light or fireworks show! To celebrate the Chinese New Year in January 2004, the magnificent structure was bathed in red lighting. In May 2006, the tower was decked out in blue on Europe Day, a celebration of peace and unity in Europe. When France hosted the Rugby World Cup in 2007, the tower was adorned with an enormous rugby ball, green lighting for the playing field, and beams of light to represent the goal. A spectacular light and fireworks show took place at the Eiffel Tower to usher in the year 2000.
The Eiffel Tower is one of the most easily recognized tourist attractions on the planet. It’s been an important part of the plot in dozens of novels and movies, including many in which it is destroyed. It has inspired over thirty replicas, including ones in Guatemala, Japan, Pakistan, Romania, Belgium, Mexico, China, Russia, and Las Vegas, Nevada. Not surprisingly, there are also replicas in Paris, Texas, and Paris, Tennessee! The tower has also inspired many people to sketch it or write about their impressions of it. To some people, the tower is a symbol of history; to others, it is a symbol of love and romance. Whatever the attraction, people know of this iconic structure and dream of visiting it.

Although Great Zimbabwe is no longer the bustling metropolis it once was, it still plays a role in modern Zimbabwe. Some modern Zimbabweans use the site for religious practices to this day. It is also one of Zimbabwe’s tourist attractions. Tourist interaction with the site has caused damage, and the ruins need protection if they are to endure another millennium. In addition, environmental factors, such as climate, are taking a toll on the ruins. Finally, invasive plants pose a threat to the integrity of the remaining structures. Legal protections have existed for Great Zimbabwe since 1893, but more government funding is urgently needed to fully preserve and study the site. In recognition of its historical and cultural importance, the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) designated the ruins a World Heritage Site in 1986, which means that nearly all countries in the world recognize the site as worthy of admiration and preservation. Preserving the ruins is complicated. It involves studying the factors contributing to Great Zimbabwe’s decline, respecting the history of the structures and land, and carefully considering the beliefs of the region’s people.
Great Zimbabwe is a site of historical significance. It reveals fascinating and important information about life and global trade in a thriving empire in medieval southern Africa. However, while the ruins have given us captivating glimpses into the past, they continue to keep many secrets. For example, what was the purpose of the conical tower within the Great Enclosure? And perhaps most intriguing of all, why was the great city deserted after centuries of prosperity? With proper care and study, perhaps the walls of Great Zimbabwe will reveal the answers to these mysteries.",1137.0

What the fall cannot do, the agouti can. The agouti is equipped with strong teeth and powerful jaws that enable it to break through a seedpod’s thick shell and feast on its contents. The agouti eats some of the seeds and scatters others throughout the forest by burying them far from the parent tree. The seeds eventually sprout into trees, and the long process begins all over again. Mistletoe plants in the desert rely on a bird called a phainopepla (fay-no-PEHP-luh) to spread. The phainopepla snacks on mistletoe seeds, which are buried in the plant’s berries, by using its beak to separate the skin from the berries and then disperses undigested seeds wherever it leaves its droppings.
The world would be a very different place without symbiotic relationships. In the absence of these natural partnerships, many species would be more vulnerable to predators and pests, more likely to be isolated in smaller patches of habitat, less apt to bloom and spread, or faced with fewer choices for food. Not only would the partners suffer, but so too would other inhabitants of our ecosystems. Scientists are still learning about how these special relationships work and are discovering new ones all the time. From shallow, sunlit waters to deep, dark caverns, Earth is full of symbiotic partners that help each other survive and thrive.
Although each symbiotic relationship is a little different and provides each species with a slightly different benefit, all have a positive impact on the world, promoting diversity and sustainability for all living things. The end result is that fish, birds, humans, and many other organisms on our planet have a better chance of surviving, reproducing, and living longer, healthier lives.",1198.0
" The last cases of naturally occurring polio in the United States were in 1979; most remaining cases were traced to the live-virus vaccine since the live virus can mutate in the intestines and cause the disease in a small number of people treated with the vaccine. In 2000, the United States decided to use only the killed-virus vaccine. Salk had not only developed the first polio vaccine, his vaccine finally eliminated the disease in the country.
Salk was not content to give speeches and accept awards; in 1960, he founded the Salk Institute as a place for scientists to work for the good of humanity. He continued his own work there, researching diseases such as cancer and HIV/AIDS and writing five books dealing with problems of society. He worked until his death in 1995. Today, the Salk Institute does cutting-edge research in biology, genetics, and neurology, and has produced several Nobel Prize winners.
Salk did not receive a Nobel Prize. At the time, many people in the scientific community agreed with Sabin when he said Salk’s work was “pure kitchen chemistry. He didn’t discover anything.” Salk was never elected to the prestigious National Academy of Sciences—the only major polio researcher never elected.Salk brought together discoveries from decades of polio research and applied new ideas to create the first polio vaccine, saving thousands of children from the crippling disease. For that, he received thanks from a grateful country, the president, Congress, and the rest of the world. Time magazine named him one of the hundred most important people of the twentieth century, and his image was placed on a U.S. stamp.Salk’s son claimed that the greatest gift Salk gave to the world was the belief that medical research should “address problems of humankind” and “make a difference.” Salk certainly achieved his goal.",1172.0
" They are afraid of this Ghost Dog, for it has cunning greater than they, stealing from their camps in fierce winters, robbing their traps, slaying their dogs, and defying their bravest hunters. Nay, the tale grows worse. Hunters there are who fail to return to the camp, and hunters there have been whom their tribesmen found with throats slashed cruelly open and with wolf prints about them in the snow greater than the prints of any wolf. Each fall, when the Yeehats follow the movement of the moose, there is a certain valley which they never enter. And women there are who become sad when the word goes over the fire of how the Evil Spirit came to select that valley for an abiding-place.
In the summers there is one visitor, however, to that valley, of which the Yeehats do not know. It is a great, gloriously coated wolf, like, and yet unlike, all other wolves. He crosses alone from the smiling timber land and comes down into an open space among the trees. Here a yellow stream flows from rotted moose-hide sacks and sinks into the ground, with long grasses growing through it and vegetable mould overrunning it and hiding its yellow from the sun; and here he muses for a time, howling once, long and mournfully, ere he departs. But he is not always alone. When the long winter nights come on and the wolves follow their meat into the lower valleys, he may be seen running at the head of the pack through the pale moonlight or glimmering borealis, leaping gigantic above his fellows, his great throat a-bellow as he sings a song of the younger world, which is the song of the pack.",1189.0
" Leaving his paintbrush aside, Pollock preferred “action painting.” He poured, splattered, and threw paint on canvases laid on the ground, not perched on a standard artist’s easel. Abstract expressionists broke free of tradition and changed the future course of art.
In the past, I would never have considered this type of painting art. But after listening to Chloe explain Pollock’s inspiration, I now have a better understanding. I remember another thing Chloe told us: that pretty landscapes and realistic-looking people are not necessarily what makes good art. Rather, it’s the art’s context, inspiration, and cultural impact that help us understand its significance and decide what we think about it. I’ll have to think about that one, but I feel like I’m starting to get what Chloe means.
By now, my legs are getting pretty tired. Chloe leads us past hundreds of European paintings—I catch glimpses of famous works by Van Gogh and Monet—and down the giant staircase back to the Great Hall to end the tour. I’m overwhelmed by how much I’ve just seen and learned. The Met is an awe-inspiring place. It’s like I’ve traveled around the world and back in time, all in a one-hour tour. I have to admit that up until now, I had completely underestimated why art is so important. As I exit the museum, the sights, sounds, and smells of New York City bombard my senses. I take a break and sit on the great steps in front of the Met—I want to jot down some ideas for my writing assignment while they’re still fresh in my mind. Now comes the real challenge: how will I choose which pieces of art to compare and contrast when they were all so amazing? One thing’s for sure: I’ll come back, but next time for longer—and for me.",1074.0
" Harakeke is an exceptionally strong material that the Maori have used for at least one thousand years to create mats, baskets, bags, clothing, and other items. Maori weaving has always been mostly a women’s art. However, men have developed ways to use harakeke for building and for hunting and fishing, such as to make ropes and fishing lines.
The Maori, along with other traditional Polynesian peoples, believe that the gods express their creativity through individual artisans. Raranga, therefore, has a spiritual dimension as well as an everyday function. In addition, this weaving tradition has been passed down from Maori ancestors and is a strong symbol of tribal traditions. The Maori suffered oppression and lost much of their land during a harsh colonial era. Raranga is living proof that their culture has survived. This weaving tradition symbolizes the unity of the Maori people and the wholeness of all creation.
The cultures and weavers in this book represent just a few of the vast number of weaving traditions around the world. Each tradition reflects a people’s native materials, everyday needs, and cultural symbols. When you see items woven by hand in a museum, art gallery, or ethnic shop, keep in mind that each piece tells a story about the long-standing traditions of the weaver’s culture. Many of these cultures continue to thrive, even in the face of global modernization. As you go about your everyday life, notice all the woven items you use. Imagine what you might wear if fabric for clothing didn’t exist. Imagine if you didn’t have sheets, blankets, or towels. Even the cloth produced by automated looms tells a story about the creative people who invented ways to convert plant fibers into fine fabrics.",1122.0
" And people who want to take their car on long trips might have to look to other forms of transportation. Car makers have tried to address some of these issues by making hybrid cars, which use two sources for power. Hybrid cars use electricity as a primary power source, but also use a small gasoline motor to charge their batteries. Hybrid owners don’t have to worry about running out of electricity on a trip because they can always fill up the gas tank if they need to drive farther. Some hybrid cars can even be powered by alternative fuels that come from plants, such as ethanol, vegetable oil, and biodiesel.
Fuel cells are another possible source of power for electric cars. Most fuel cells create electricity by splitting hydrogen atoms and combining them with oxygen atoms from the air. After the electricity has been produced by this chemical reaction and used to charge a battery, the oxygen and hydrogen join together to make water—H²O—which is all that comes out of the car’s exhaust. Fuel cells are still not practical for everyday cars. They are expensive and need lots of hydrogen, which is hard to get, dangerous , and difficult to store safely in a car.
What is the future of the electric car? Will electricity for motors come from the Sun, the wind, vegetable oil, biodiesel from plants and algae, ethanol from corn or sugar cane, hydrogen from natural gas—another fossil fuel, or from a totally new source that has not yet been discovered? The possibilities seem endless, and the energy situation is constantly changing.

Zoos are a complex, controversial topic, and the disagreements about them are not likely to be resolved in the near future. It could be argued that each zoo must be considered individually, since a small, privately owned roadside zoo is quite a bit different from a large city zoo with naturalistic enclosures, captive-breeding programs, and expert biologists. As you give further thought to zoos, consider the possibility that they might not be able to be labeled as simply good or bad. We invite you to make a list of the goals that you believe every zoo should focus on.

Female Goliath spiders have slightly shorter legs than males, but their bodies are larger. Females also live much longer. Some females have survived more than twenty-five years in captivity, but males live fewer than ten. For reasons that scientists are still trying to understand, females often kill males during the mating process. After mating, a female Goliath lays about fifty eggs in a silk egg sac and stores the sac in her burrow. While waiting for the eggs to hatch, she carries the sac with her when she’s out searching for food. She guards the eggs until they hatch in about six to seven weeks. The spiderlings stay under her watchful eye for a few weeks, until after their first molt. Then they’re on their own.
Goliaths have been around for millions of years—and they haven’t changed much in all that time. Their sheer size has always fascinated people, from local folks to scientists to spider enthusiasts. We’re continuing to learn about how these spiders regenerate limbs and how Goliath venom affects the nervous system of their prey. Although the thought of one of these spiders crawling up your arm might terrify you, Goliath spiders, like all living things, play an important role in the ecological landscape where they live. They not only help keep rodents, insects, and other species in check, but they also provide food for a number of predators. Learning about Goliath spiders and other living things in the rainforest helps us understand the relationships between species and the importance of protecting them and their environment. If you’re ever in Goliath bird-eating spider territory, you might want to observe these giants from a distance. They’re huge, hairy, and may be scary, but they’re definitely one of the most interesting giants in the animal kingdom.",1104.0
" The small lava chunks and bits of ash harden into lightweight black rocks called cinders. The cinders pile up around the vent into a cone-shaped hill with a crater at the top. Such hills are called cinder cones. Brand-new volcanoes that suddenly appear often form cinder cones. Other cinder cones pile up inside the craters or calderas of larger, older volcanoes. Most cinder cones erupt only once. Because cinder cones are made of loose rocks, they usually erode quickly in the wind and rain.
Lava domes also result from small, brief eruptions, but the lava that forms these structures is a thick, pasty liquid that oozes from the vent and quickly hardens. Sometimes, more lava pushes up and expands through the center of the dome, cracking the outside. These domes often form in areas with other volcanic activity. They are often found in the craters and calderas of larger volcanoes. Like composite volcanoes, lava domes often explode violently.
Volcanoes are the most spectacular evidence we have that Earth is a changing planet. Lava pouring from a volcanic vent creates new rock and new land, and volcanic ash makes extremely fertile soil that is useful for farming. In some places, people use the geothermal energy from volcanoes to run power plants and produce electricity. Some people even live inside volcanoes. In Rabaul, in the country of Papua New Guinea, volcanoes sometimes erupt inside the town. Volcanic mountains, including Mount Fuji in Japan, Mount Rainier in Washington, and Mauna Loa in Hawaii, are some of the most recognizable and beautiful mountains in the world. It is no wonder that humans often choose to live near volcanoes, but we should always remember that volcanoes can be violent, dangerous places. Volcanoes unleash some of Earth’s most powerful forces.",1100.0
" Other forms of enrichment include things that stimulate the senses. Some zoos make frozen taste treats for their animals, including ratsicles and fishsicles.
Other sensory enrichment may include stimulating the sense of smell with cooking spices. Sometimes zookeepers even place animal poop in an animal’s enclosure—such as giraffe poop in a lion exhibit—as a type of enrichment. Many zoos do some amount of behavioral training of animals—often as a way to enable staff to provide better care. For example, lions and tigers can be trained to touch a “target” or to put their tail through a fence. Later, they will accept an injection in the same manner. A baboon can be trained to present a shoulder for the same purpose. Such training can help zoo veterinarians provide better, and often less intrusive, care.
A constant concern at all zoos is where money is going to come from. It takes a huge amount of money to keep and care for zoo animals, maintain exhibits, and pay staff salaries. Zoos must always look for ways to pay for expenses. Every zoo has a “wish list” of projects, including updating exhibits and developing new ones.
Today’s zoos are extremely different from the private animal collections of rulers long ago. Over the centuries, increased knowledge has resulted in enormous improvements in the care of captive animals, the quality of their enclosures, and the environmental enrichment they receive. Most zoos are taking educated, positive, and active steps to save animals from extinction as well as to educate the public about the importance of preserving wild habitats. The next time you visit a zoo, keep in mind that its animals are not just entertaining you. They are also reminding you of the amazing diversity of the natural world, which our involvement can help to protect and preserve.",1105.0
" While this extreme cold would kill most creatures, these fish survive thanks to different kinds of antifreezes in their bodies. If scientists can determine how these antifreezes are made and work, they could discover a variety of uses, including organ transplants and ocean exploration.
People use tons of plastic every year, and the way we make plastic uses great amounts of energy and creates huge amounts of waste. However, scientists have found that some kinds of microorganisms make the building blocks of plastics in their cells. If scientists can figure out how these microorganisms begin to make plastics, they can mimic that process and make plastics using less energy and with much less waste.
Other animals have been surviving in the wild for thousands of years, and like us, they sometimes get sick. By seeing which plants and other things that animals, such as chimpanzees, use to treat themselves, we can discover new medicines and treatments for our own illnesses.

" While she ran the prosperous business, Elizabeth also created several inventions, including a new kind of milk can and a stackable garbage can. When her husband died after nine years of marriage, she took over his businesses. Having seen firsthand during her time as a journalist how badly factory workers were often treated, she made sure to do the opposite, paying her workers well, providing health care, and even installing a gym and a library in her factories for her employees to use. Her success didn’t last forever. Despite her largesse toward her employees, some of them were embezzling, or secretly stealing money, from her businesses. Iron Clad Manufacturing went bankrupt. Elizabeth’s days as an industrialist were over.
After her businesses failed, Elizabeth once again assumed her Nellie Bly persona and went back to reporting. Writing for the New York Journal, she continued to give a voice to the downtrodden. She chronicled the women’s suffrage movement, correctly predicting years in advance that women wouldn’t gain the right to vote until at least 1920 (the Nineteenth Amendment was ratified on August 18 of that year). She moved to Austria just before the outbreak of the First World War and spent several years there as a war correspondent for readers back home in America. She returned to New York after the war and continued to write for the Journal until 1922, when she got pneumonia. She died soon after.

Flights on vehicles such as SpaceShipTwo will allow tourists to experience weightlessness in space for several minutes, but what if you wanted to see what it’s like to stay in space for weeks or even months at a time? At least one company—Bigelow Aerospace—is working to make space hotels a reality. Bigelow is creating a “balloon habitat.” The habitat folds up into a rocket’s cargo area and expands when it is placed into orbit. The company is working on a unit that will house six people in a space similar in size to the ISS. The skin of the Bigelow habitat is made of a strong fabric called Mylar. Building a space station out of fabric may seem strange, but Bigelow engineers say that the fabric will actually work better than metal. NASA thinks these habitats are safe, too; the space agency is looking at buying one to expand the ISS. While these blow-up habitats aren’t ready yet, Bigelow sent two empty test models into space in 2006 and 2007.

The best solution was a permanent bridge that would always be open to traffic. In 1962, the four-lane Bridge of the Americas at the Pacific entrance to the canal was completed. A second bridge was built 9 miles (14.5 km) north of the Bridge of the Americas in 2004 to help reduce traffic jams on the Pan-American Highway.
The United States controlled the canal until the end of 1999, when Panama took it over as part of a treaty agreement. By the early twenty-first century, the canal was showing its age. More than fourteen thousand ships and three hundred million tons of cargo were passing through its locks annually. It badly needed a makeover to allow it to handle larger ships and resolve the problem of traffic jams. In 2006, the people of Panama voted to build two new sets of locks and two new navigation lanes to connect those locks to the existing channels. In 2016, forty-thousand workers completed the $5.4 billion, ten-year construction project. The new locks allow the canal to accommodate modern sailing vessels, effectively doubling the amount of cargo it can handle each day. Since the new locks are wider, they also allow tugboats, rather than mule locomotives, to guide ships through the system. The expansion is yet another marvel of engineering in the canal’s long history.",1089.0
" After lecture tours in the United States, the Far East, Spain, and South America, Einstein was again teaching in Germany when the Nazi Party won a critical election in 1925. He strongly disagreed with the Nazis’ social and political beliefs. In 1932, after his third lecture tour in the United States, Princeton University offered Einstein a part-time teaching position that would alternate with his work in Germany. He accepted and moved his family to New Jersey at the end of the year. In January of 1933, Adolf Hitler was appointed chancellor of Germany and Einstein never returned to Germany. He became a U.S. citizen in 1940.
Einstein was a passionate supporter of peace and disarmament. During World War I, he was one of the few German scholars who spoke out against Germany’s involvement in the war. After the war, he was criticized harshly for his pacifist (peaceful) values. After World War II, Einstein’s plea for international disarmament increased. Although he had helped to develop the first atomic bomb, he spoke against further development or use of nuclear weapons by any nation.
Einstein died on April 18, 1955, in Princeton, New Jersey, at the age of 76. One of his legacies was the demonstration, through his own example, that one needn’t be a genius in every area of life to make significant contributions. He did not speak until the age of three, failed a school entrance exam, did not excel in college, and was so absentminded that he had difficulty remembering his own address. Yet despite these shortcomings, he made enormous contributions to the understanding of how the physical world works. For those contributions, and for his vision of a peaceful world, he deserves the recognition and unique level of respect he has been accorded.",1153.0
" People mainly explore Petra on their own, starting with the Treasury and moving on to tombs, the museum, and other sights.
It’s possible to see Petra in two days, but locals say five days are ideal. They advise tourists to be prepared to walk a lot, wear sturdy shoes, and bring sunblock, sunglasses, a hat, and a camera. Water is another necessity, as the desert can get extremely hot in summer. Petra is vulnerable to wind and water erosion as well as weathering caused by salt carried by wind from the Red Sea. The salt can enter small pores in the stone and then crystallize, causing damage. Tourists wear down surfaces by touching, sitting, and walking on structures. In 1985, the Rose City was awarded the status of a UNESCO World Heritage Site, which ensures its protection and conservation.
Petra is among the world’s greatest archaeological sites. Researchers estimate that at least 90 percent of Petra has not yet been excavated. New discoveries are being made all the time, many thanks to state-of-the-art technology. Satellite imagery and photos taken by aerial drones recently helped archaeologists find a huge open platform likely used for public or other ceremonies, and ground-penetrating radar located a network of water channels under the Great Temple’s courtyard. Other recent discoveries have included fountains and once-lush gardens. More than two thousand years after the Rose City was carved out of solid rock, Petra’s construction and use continue to capture the imagination and curiosity of people around the world. This remarkable ancient city still holds many secrets about how the Nabataeans transformed a barren desert into a magnificent urban oasis.",1186.0
" “You seek to close these places on the Seventh Day,” said Scrooge. “And it comes to the same thing.” “ I seek!” exclaimed the Spirit.
“Forgive me if I am wrong. It has been done in your name, or at least in that of your family,” said Scrooge. “There are some upon this earth of yours,” returned the Spirit, “who lay claim to know us, and who do their deeds of passion, pride, ill-will, hatred, envy, bigotry, and selfishness in our name. They are as strange to us and all our kith and kin, as if they had never lived. Remember that, and charge their doings on themselves, not us.” Scrooge promised that he would; and they went on, invisible, as they had been before, into the suburbs of the town. It was a remarkable quality of the Ghost (which Scrooge had observed at the baker’s), that notwithstanding his gigantic size, he could accommodate himself to any place with ease. That he stood beneath a low roof quite as gracefully and like a supernatural creature, as it was possible he could have done in any lofty hall. And perhaps it was the pleasure the good Spirit had in showing off this power of his, or else it was his own kind, generous, hearty nature, and his sympathy with all poor men, that led him straight to Scrooge’s clerk’s.
For there he went, and took Scrooge with him, holding to his robe; and on the threshold of the door the Spirit smiled, and stopped to bless Bob Cratchit’s dwelling with the sprinkling of his torch. Think of that. Bob had but fifteen bob a week himself; he pocketed on Saturdays but fifteen copies of his Christian name; and yet the Ghost of Christmas Present blessed his four-roomed house.",1091.0
" The fine, nearly invisible thread could be used during eye surgery, for example, or even to create artificial ligaments. Unfortunately, a single ounce of spider silk requires fourteen thousand spiders—and since spiders tend to eat their neighbors, large-scale “spider farms” are out of the question. Since standard animal hybridization techniques won’t work for species that are too different from one another, scientists used genetic engineering techniques to insert silk proteins from the golden orb weaver spider into goat DNA. Goats then produce the spider silk proteins in their milk, and scientists extract those proteins in the lab. The process and results are still imperfect, but researchers hope to engineer goats that can produce useful amounts of spider silk someday.
Since spider genes were artificially introduced—inserted into goat embryos in the laboratory—“spider goats” are considered transgenic rather than hybrid animals.
Animal Hybrids: Problem or Solution?
In the past, scientists thought that animal hybrids represented an evolutionary dead end. Most hybrid offspring were sterile, and while the parents were probably well adapted to their specific environments, by combining their characteristics, the hybrid would end up adapted to neither. In most cases, this is exactly what we see in nature: hybrid species tend to be poorly adapted to their environments and often fail to survive and reproduce. However, when animals face drastic environmental changes, the process of evolution may occur too slowly for species to adapt to changing conditions. Hybrids provide a way for two species to exchange genetic information, potentially combining it in new and useful ways. Are hybrid animals a threat to biodiversity in the world today? Or are they nature’s way of expediting the process of adaptation in the face of rapidly changing environmental conditions? They may be a bit of both—only time will tell!",1298.0
" There it is, using its tusks to clear paths through snow, probably searching for plants. The woolly mammoth stands almost 12 feet (3.6 m) tall, but another Mammuthus species can grow as tall as 14 feet (4.3 m). Early humans hunt mammoths and paint pictures of them, which can still be seen on cave walls in modern Europe. Mammoths will become extinct at the end of the ice age, when the weather becomes too warm for them.
Don’t take off your winter coat yet. Another huge mammal that lives during the last ice age is Megatherium, a giant ground sloth. It lives about 2 million to 8,000 years ago and is almost 20 feet (6 m) long. Megatherium is related to the much smaller tree sloths that live in South America today. The one you’re watching is standing on its hind legs, using its tail for balance, which shouldn’t surprise you. Fossil footprints found in your time show that it could stand and even walk upright. And speaking of your time, you should probably be getting back...
A World Without Giants?
Isn’t it amazing to think that giants such as the ones in this book once walked on Earth and swam in the ocean? It’s too bad we can’t see these huge creatures today. However, you don’t have to get in a time machine to see gigantic animals. Blue whales, great white sharks, giant squids, grizzly bears, elephants, giraffes, ostriches, condors, and anacondas are some of the large animals that share the planet with us today. Unfortunately, many of these animals are threatened with extinction. It’s important to protect these animals, mainly by preserving their habitats. That way, we can be sure that we’ll never live in a world without giants.",903.0
" Other bus safety features may include flashing stop signs to alert drivers that students are getting off or on the bus and cameras that help drivers see what’s happening inside the bus and outside. We can expect to see additional safety upgrades in the school bus system as technology advances.
Yellow Buses Go “Green”
Some school districts are also beginning to make environmentally friendly upgrades to buses. A school district in New York, for example, introduced a fully electric school bus in 2016 with zero carbon emissions, which means the electric engine doesn’t put pollutants into the air. The bus can travel for about 120 miles (190 km) before it needs to be recharged. Another “green” trend in school bus technology is the use of propane fuel. Propane is much less expensive than traditional diesel fuel, and it helps to reduce emissions as well.
School buses can also reduce carbon emissions by replacing private vehicles on the road. The average school bus can transport fifty-four students. That eliminates about thirty-six private vehicles that would otherwise be used to drive students to school. This fact, along with newer, greener technology, can help keep the air cleaner.
As the school bus slows to a stop, Sarah opens her eyes, startled to find that she’s dozed off. She hastily gathers her things and follows the other students off the bus. The driver calls out, “Have a good day!” Sarah and the other students wave as they head into the school building. The bus pulls away from the curb, its job done for now. At the end of the day, it’ll be waiting for them, ready to start the whole journey again in reverse.",1048.0

In the 1980s, the Indian government put a number of measures in place to help protect the monument from pollution. The “Taj Trapezium”—an area surrounding Agra where no major polluting industries would be permitted—was created in 1982. Two years later, the government created a 2-kilometer (1.2 mi.) emission-free zone surrounding the Taj Mahal. The Indian Supreme Court put additional measures in place in 1996 since air pollution levels remained high in the city. As a result, polluting industries located near the Taj Mahal had to switch to a cleaner fuel source (natural gas) or move beyond the protected zone. In 2001, several organizations came together to form the Taj Mahal Conservation Collaborative, a group dedicated to the conservation, restoration, and beautification of the Taj Mahal. This group has undertaken projects such as removing stains from the Taj Mahal’s white marble using detergents and absorbent clay packs. Although the Taj Mahal faces numerous challenges, it has survived earthquakes, lightning, wars, and floods over the past several centuries. With a bit of luck and a lot of hard work, it will survive the coming centuries as well.
Shah Jahan desired a memorial for his beloved wife so magnificent that it would be admired by the entire world for all time. Today, the Taj Mahal sees thousands of daily visitors—millions each year—from all over the world. The United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) declared the Taj Mahal a World Heritage Site, and an international vote established it as one of the New Seven Wonders of the World. Centuries after its construction, the Taj Mahal remains one of the most beautiful memorials ever created.",1274.0
" Peeping out, he saw his train get up speed again and disappear at a great pace. Then out of the tunnel burst the pursuing engine, roaring and whistling, her motley crew waving their various weapons and shouting, “Stop, stop, stop!” When they were past, the Toad had a hearty laugh—for the first time since he was thrown into prison.
But he soon stopped laughing when he came to consider that it was now very late and dark and cold, and he was in an unknown wood, with no money and no chance of supper, and still far from friends and home; and the dead silence of everything, after the roar and rattle of the train, was something of a shock. He dared not leave the shelter of the trees, so he struck into the wood, with the idea of leaving the railway as far as possible behind him. After so many weeks within walls, he found the wood strange and unfriendly and inclined, he thought, to make fun of him. Nightjars, sounding their mechanical rattle, made him think that the wood was full of searching warders, closing in on him. Once he met a fox, who stopped, looked him up and down in a sarcastic sort of way, and said, “Hullo, washerwoman! Half a pair of socks and a pillowcase short this week! Mind it doesn’t occur again!” and swaggered off, sniggering. Toad looked about for a stone to throw at him but could not succeed in finding one, which vexed him more than anything. At last, cold, hungry, and tired out, he sought the shelter of a hollow tree, where with branches and dead leaves he made himself as comfortable a bed as he could, and slept soundly till the morning.",1131.0
" But I must first give some little account of myself and of my thoughts about living, which it may well be supposed were not a few.
I had a dismal prospect of my condition; for as I was cast away upon that island after having been driven by a violent storm quite out of the course of our intended voyage, and some hundreds of leagues out of the ordinary course of the trade of mankind, I had great reason to consider it my fate that in this desolate place, and in this desolate manner, I should end my life. The tears would run plentifully down my face when I made these reflections, and sometimes I would ask myself why Providence should thus completely ruin its creatures and render them so absolutely miserable, so without help abandoned, so entirely depressed, that it could hardly be rational to be thankful for such a life.
But something always returned swift upon me to check these thoughts and to reprove me; and particularly one day, walking with my gun in my hand by the seaside, I was very pensive upon the subject of my present condition, when reason, as it were, expostulated with me t’other way, thus: “Well, you are in a desolate condition it is true, but pray remember, where are the rest of you? Did not you come eleven of you in the boat? Where are the ten? Why were not they saved, and you lost? Why were you singled out? Is it better to be here, or there?” And then I pointed to the sea. All evils are to be considered with the good that is in them, and with what worse attends them.",1212.0
" Spider-Man and Batman comics have been challenged because of adult language or themes. Censorship has been a panel topic at recent cons, with readers, teachers, and librarians discussing the issue. One result of these discussions has been the rise of the labels “graphic novel” and “graphic memoir” to classify comic books that are intended for adult audiences. Some comics are fictional and some aren’t; some are educational and some are meant for pure entertainment. Some deal with large social problems and adult themes, while others provide an escape into fantasy worlds. Given this diversity, should all comics be shelved together in libraries and schools or not? What role do comics have in our larger society? These questions are frequent topics at comic con panels.
The continuous expansion of the comic book landscape can be challenging, but overall it’s an exciting time for comic cons. The huge diversity of the comics (and other pop culture media) available today has resulted in bigger, more diverse audiences for comics and conventions. Fans of every age, gender, and nationality can find themselves represented in a comic somewhere. Heroes might look like Superman, a young girl from Botswana, or a reporter on the ground in Bosnia. There is no limit to what can happen in a comic book or who can be its heroes. In the end, this is what draws people to comic cons. The cons (and the stories that drive them) create worlds where ordinary people can be transformed into heroes, and where heroes can be virtually anyone. People lose themselves in possibility every time they dress up as a favorite character, trade books and trivia questions with fellow fans, and shake hands with an artist at a comic con. Many people return to that experience over and over.",1089.0
" But once hip-hop records started becoming hugely popular, the rappers themselves became the stars. From the release of “Rapper’s Delight” by the Sugarhill Gang in 1979, rap’s first worldwide hit, through the present day, rap music has evolved and transformed in many different ways. Although it has always functioned as party music, even the earliest rappers used their skills to address serious social and political issues.
“The Message,” released in 1982 by Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, described a blistering portrait of urban poverty and misery in the streets of New York. Now, rap music has grown to the point where it can encompass any style, and rapping has been featured in songs of almost every genre, from hard rock to country pop.
In the early 1980s, as more and more rap records became popular around the world, hip-hop culture became a global phenomenon. Hip-hop took root in France, Mexico, South Africa, and Brazil—virtually everywhere that had pop music. Breakdancing caught the media’s imagination, through news reports and the release of films such as Wild Style (1982) and Breakin’ (1984), and spread worldwide, especially in the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, Germany, France, Russia, and South Korea. To this day, hip-hop has permeated many aspects of popular culture globally, leaving an indelible mark. What started at a young girl’s street party in the South Bronx in 1973 has become a global phenomenon. Poverty and the lack of means should have stopped hip-hop’s success. Instead, it inspired creativity and some of the most influential musical innovations of the twentieth century. All it took was imagination, a determination to express oneself, and the desire to have fun.",1314.0
"
Some oceanographers divide the midnight zone into two additional zones: the abyssal zone and ocean trenches. The abyssal zone is completely dark and covers much of the ocean floor, including vast plains, mountains, valleys, and canyons. Ocean trenches occur along faults where large plates of the Earth’s crust come together. The colliding plates create canyons and cracks of up to 10,000 meters (32,808 ft) deep where the pressure is great and the water is very cold and totally black. You would think that nothing could survive in such a hostile environment, but openings at the bottom of the trenches spew hot water and minerals from deep within the Earth and provide life-sustaining warmth.
The openings form when seawater comes in contact with hot magma. Animals living in this zone take advantage of the warmth and nutrients from these openings in much the same way that phytoplankton use light from the Sun. Tube worms, shrimp, and giant clams can all be found feeding on these bacteria around the openings, or chimneys. These chimneys, called hydrothermal vents, were first discovered in 1977 by scientists exploring the ocean floor near the Galapagos Islands. Only a few submersibles, or submarines, have been built strong enough to withstand the enormous pressure at the bottom of a trench.
So you see, even though phytoplankton are only at the top of the ocean, we’re at the center of the food web, supporting all other life in the sea. In spite of our microscopic size, we have a significant impact not only on what other ocean creatures eat, but what you eat as well. Whether you enjoy the ocean for the beauty of coral reefs, the mystery of the abyssal zone, or some tasty fish and chips, you have us phytoplankton to thank.",1116.0
" Goliath beetle eggs hatch after about two weeks, when the young larvae, sometimes called grubs, emerge. Eyeless and wingless, they spend all their time eating and growing. No one knows exactly what Goliath larvae eat in the wild, but they most likely feed on rotting plant matter found in the soil. In captivity, however, the larvae also eat smaller beetle larvae and adult insects. Goliath larvae grow quickly, reaching full size in about four months, near the end of the wet season. The larger species can grow up to 5 inches (12.7 cm) in length—nearly as long as a dollar bill—and weigh a whopping 3.5 ounces (100 g). When the wet season ends, the larvae burrow deeper underground until they reach sandy soil. There, they use the soil to build thin-walled “cells,” similar to butterfly cocoons, in which they enter the pupal stage. Metamorphosis occurs inside these cells over the next several months during the dry season. Wings and legs form and fold into place. The outside of a pupa’s body hardens into a protective shell. The new adult hibernates inside the earthen cell until the following wet season starts. When moisture seeps deep enough into the soil to reach the hibernating beetle, it awakens, emerges from the soil, and begins the cycle again.
The speedy Goliath beetle is an elusive giant—hard to spot and even harder to catch. However, its bold stripes and immense size make it a favorite with insect enthusiasts. Some fans even keep Goliath beetles as pets. That’s fortunate for scientists, who owe much of their knowledge of Goliath beetles to the study of captive insects. Big as a songbird, striped like a zebra, and agile as an aerial acrobat, the Goliath beetle is one amazing insect!",1039.0
" From space, a hurricane looks like a huge pinwheel. The outer parts of the pinwheel form a towering mass of rapidly circling storm clouds. At the center of the pinwheel is a calm area called the “eye” of the hurricane, where there is no wind or rain. A hurricane can be up to 600 miles (965 km) wide.
When a hurricane comes ashore, it drenches coastal areas with hammering rains and buffets them with heavy winds. The winds of a major hurricane can exceed 150 miles (240 km) per hour—strong enough to rip the roofs off many houses. Gusts from a major hurricane can match the wind speed of the most powerful tornado. The biggest danger for low-lying communities is a wall of water, called the storm surge, which is forced toward land by the strength of the winds. The storm surge of a major hurricane can be up to 20 feet (6 m) high, and it can cause extensive flooding and loss of life far inland. One of the worst hurricanes to hit the United States in recent years was Hurricane Katrina in August 2005. The hurricane caused severe destruction and killed thousands along the Gulf Coast in the states of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, and Florida.
People can protect themselves from some elements of devastating weather, but they can’t escape them entirely. Parts of the United States with no tornadoes or hurricanes may have broiling summers or harsh winters. On the West Coast, earthquakes and brush fires often make up for the moderate weather. When choosing a place to live, it’s probably most important for people—rather than worrying about the extremes or the worst calamities that may occur—to consider an area’s general climate. That’s the weather that will provide both the consistency and the drama they seek.",1068.0

Conclusion The world would be a very different place without symbiotic relationships . In the absence of these natural partnerships, many species would be more vulnerable to predators and pests, more likely to be isolated in smaller patches of habitat, less apt to bloom and spread, or faced with fewer choices for food . Not only would the partners suffer, but so too would other inhabitants of Earth’s ecosystems .Scientists are still learning about how these extraordinary relationships work and are discovering new ones all the time . From shallow, sunlit waters to deep, dark caverns, Earth is full of symbiotic partners that help each other survive and thrive .
Although each symbiotic relationship is a little different and provides each species with a slightly different benefit, all help sustain balance within their ecosystems . What symbiotic relationships have in common is the positive impact they have on the world as a whole, promoting diversity and sustainability for all living things .

" In the United States, GMO foods are allowed on the market unless they can be proved to be harmful. The government does not require special labels for foods made from GMOs. Yet public opinion polls show that most consumers in the United States want to see labels on foods containing genetically modified ingredients. They say that clearly labeling products containing GMO ingredients would help people choose whether they want to consume GMO foods.
Some people are working to get new laws passed that would require labeling of GMO foods in the states where they live. In 2014, Vermont became the first state to require labels on GMO foods sold within its boundaries. Some businesses across the country, such as specialty grocery stores, have also pledged to label any GMO foods they sell. The companies that develop, grow, and market genetically modified foods say that requiring GMO labels on their products will unfairly hurt their business. Spokespeople for the GMO industry argue that labels won’t help educate the public with the facts about GMOs. Some say that due to public fears about the risks of GMOs, any label will scare people away. They say that labels will lump together GMO products that are made with different methods or ingredients. They warn that labels will only increase fear and slow development of new GMO products that might benefit people. Finally, they say that labeling every product will be expensive and complicated.

Despite these advantages, high-speed rail is not always the best solution for a region’s transportation needs. High-speed rail systems can be very expensive to build. The cost of adding a new high-speed rail line can sometimes rise to many millions of dollars for each mile of track. Many countries see the building costs as an investment in the future, but other countries wonder whether such large investments are worth it.
Also, it doesn’t matter how amazing a train is if not enough people are riding it. For high-speed trains to make economic or environmental sense, each train needs to carry as many passengers as possible. For this reason, it only makes sense to build high-speed trains in places where large numbers of people travel frequently. Areas with high population density pack many people into a limited amount of space. One of the reasons that high-speed trains have been successful in areas such as Europe, Japan, and China is that these countries all have many areas with high population density.
High-speed rail is growing by leaps and bounds as new lines are added in new countries and on new continents. Europe plans to link together its many separate high-speed rail systems to form a gigantic trans-European network by 2025. Morocco is building Africa’s first high-speed rail system. In the United States, the first true high-speed rail network is being developed in California. If completed as planned, it will allow people to go from Los Angeles to San Francisco in under two hours and twenty minutes while traveling at speeds up to 220 mph (354 kph). As world population increases and concerns about energy sources and the environment grow, high-speed trains will play an important part in helping the world meet its transportation needs.",1198.0
"” “Will there be strawberry jam for tea?” asked Nicholas innocently. “Certainly there will be,” said the aunt, privately resolving that Nicholas should have none of it. “Now I know that you are the Evil One and not aunt,” shouted Nicholas gleefully; “when we asked aunt for strawberry jam yesterday she said there wasn’t any. I know there are four jars of it in the store cupboard, because I looked, and of course you know it’s there, but she doesn’t, because she said there wasn’t any. Oh, Devil, you have sold yourself!”
There was an unusual sense of luxury in being able to talk to an aunt as though one was talking to the Evil One, but Nicholas knew, with childish discernment, that such luxuries were not to be over-indulged in. He walked noisily away, and it was a kitchenmaid, in search of parsley, who eventually rescued the aunt from the rain-water Tea that evening was partaken of in a fearsome silence. The tide had been at its highest when the children had arrived at Jagborough Cove, so there had been no sands to play on—a circumstance that the aunt had overlooked in the haste of organising her punitive expedition. The tightness of Bobby’s boots had had disastrous effect on his temper the whole of the afternoon, and altogether the children could not have been said to have enjoyed themselves. The aunt maintained the frozen muteness of one who has suffered undignified and unmerited detention in a rain-water tank for thirty-five minutes.

" A copy of this treaty now hangs on the wall of the United Nations General Assembly building. Thirteen years later, Ramses married a Hittite princess to seal the agreement.
Ramses II ruled until 1213, a reign of sixty- six or sixty-seven years, before dying of natural causes at the age of ninety-one. At the end of his life, Ramses suffered from arthritis, dental issues, and arterial disease, which may have contributed to his death. He outlived his oldest son and original heir, Amen-her-khepeshef, as well as the next eleven sons in line for the throne. His thirteenth son, Merneptah, became pharaoh after Ramses II. He ruled for the next decade, but the Nineteenth Dynasty was already beginning its decline. Egypt lost control of Nubia, and many of Ramses’s magnificent temples were abandoned to the desert sands. Only 150 years after Ramses’s death, the New Kingdom came to an end.
Ramses II was so famous in ancient Egypt that at least nine pharaohs were named after him. Today, he is known as Ramses the Great due partly to his military accomplishments. Under Ramses’s leadership, Egypt took back many of the territories lost under previous pharaohs, and the country controlled more territory than ever. Ramses was also responsible for building more monuments and temples than any other pharaoh—structures that people still admire and study today. The many statues, elaborate illustrations, and many hieroglyphs that decorate them provide historians with a wealth of information about life in ancient Egypt. From a modern perspective, these are the true reasons behind Ramses II’s greatness: he left behind a legacy of art, architecture, and historical records that allow us to better understand the people and culture of his time.",1166.0

If you’ve ever accidentally walked into a spider’s web, you know how sticky and strong it is. Strands of spider silk are three times as strong as threads of steel. Silk strength and spiderwebs’ unique designs make them flexible but sturdy. Scientists hope that by analyzing spider silk and spiderweb design they can create material that mimics the strength and flexibility of arachnid architecture. Such material could be used in fences along highways that could absorb the impact of a speeding vehicle and minimize crash injuries.
Plastic is everywhere, it seems—humans make millions of tons of this durable material, and it’s used in everything from medical devices to toys. Once those items are discarded, however, their durability becomes a problem, resulting in huge piles of waste that don’t go away. Scientists think they may have found an alternative to artificial plastics in natural plastics produced by microorganisms. Bacteria play a role not only in the production of natural plastics, but also in their disposal—different microbes in soil feed on natural plastic refuse, turning it into carbon dioxide and water.
Animals in the wild can become ill, just as humans can, but some species, such as chimpanzees and monkeys, seem to know just how to treat their ailments by using native plants or minerals. Observing animal behavior to learn how these species treat themselves may provide insights into potential uses for human illness.
Nature provides important lessons for humans, but there is still much to be learned. By studying the living things around us, scientists can find inspiration for solutions to important problems and learn how we can live more sustainably. The best answers may be right under our noses, waiting to be discovered through the science of biomimicry.",1207.0

The visitor center has displays about the natural history of the region as well as the history of the dam and the Bureau of Reclamation’s efforts to help settle the West and assist with irrigation. Visitors can drive across the top of the dam on Highway 93. They can also enjoy great views at an overlook as well as tours of the dam and power plant. Each year, close to one million people take the tours. Lake Mead offers recreational opportunities year-round, including fishing, boating, and picnicking. Visitors can also enjoy viewing and photographing the many plants and animals that live in the area.
Hoover Dam is no longer the world’s tallest dam—as of 2014, twenty-six were higher—but it’s still among the most famous. Constructing the dam involved overcoming nearly impossible challenges, not the least of which was the site’s remote location and the need to set up transportation, power, and housing before most of the work could begin. The immensity of the structure was a technical achievement that advanced the field of dam design and construction around the world. Today, millions of people benefit from the labor of Hoover Dam’s builders. The dam transformed the Southwest, providing water and power to California, Arizona, and southern Nevada and allowing the region to flourish. The landmark’s construction and impact are an unforgettable chapter in United States history.",1198.0
" In point of fact the three actions of perceiving, determining, and responding were sequential; but so infinitesimal were the intervals of time between them that they appeared simultaneous. His muscles were surcharged with vitality, and snapped into play sharply, like steel springs. Life streamed through him in splendid flood, glad and rampant, until it seemed that it would burst him asunder in sheer ecstasy and pour forth generously over the world. “Never was there such a dog,” said John Thornton one day, as the partners watched Buck marching out of camp. “When he was made, the mould was broke,” said Pete. “Py jingo! I t’ink so mineself,” Hans affirmed.
They saw him marching out of camp, but they did not see the instant and terrible transformation which took place as soon as he was within the secrecy of the forest. He no longer marched. At once he became a thing of the wild, stealing along softly, cat-footed, a passing shadow that appeared and disappeared among the shadows. He knew how to take advantage of every cover, to crawl on his belly like a snake, and like a snake to leap and strike. He could take a ptarmigan from its nest, kill a rabbit as it slept, and snap in midair the little chipmunks fleeing a second too late for the trees. Fish, in open pools, were not too quick for him; nor were beaver, mending their dams, too wary. He killed to eat, not from wantonness; but he preferred to eat what he killed himself. So a lurking humor ran through his deeds, and it was his delight to steal upon the squirrels, and, when he all but had them, to let them go, chattering in mortal fear to the treetops.",1142.0
" The government does not require special labels for foods made from GMOs. Yet public opinion polls show that most consumers in the United States want to see labels on foods containing genetically modified ingredients.
Many people believe that by clearly labeling products containing GMO ingredients, they can choose for themselves whether they want to consume GMO foods. Some people are working to get new laws passed that would require labeling of GMO foods in the states where they live. So far, most of those efforts have been unsuccessful. In 2014, Vermont became the first state to require labels on GMO foods sold within its boundaries. Some businesses across the country, such as specialty grocery stores, have also pledged to label any GMO foods they sell.
The companies that develop, grow, and market genetically modified foods say that requiring GMO labels on their products will unfairly hurt their business. Spokespeople for the GMO industry argue that labels won’t help educate the public with the facts about GMOs. Some say that due to public fears about the risks of GMO foods, any label that says “GMO” will automatically keep people from buying a product. Many industry insiders fear that mandatory labels will lump all GMO products into one category. They warn that labels will only promote more fear and hinder development of new GMO products that might benefit people in the future. Finally, they say that labeling every product will be expensive and complicated.
People have been eating foods grown from genetically engineered seeds for only the past two decades. While hundreds of published reports have explored the benefits and risks of GMO foods, many people believe the jury is still out on whether or not GMO foods are safe.",1239.0
" Casually, then, and with seeming indifference, the Mole turned his talk to the harvest that was being gathered in, the towering wagons and their straining teams, the growing ricks, and the large moon rising over bare acres dotted with sheaves. He talked of the reddening apples around, of the browning nuts, of jams and preserves and the distilling of cordials; till by easy stages such as these he reached midwinter, its hearty joys and its snug home life, and then he became simply lyrical.
By degrees the Rat began to sit up and to join in. His dull eye brightened, and he lost some of his listening air. Presently the tactful Mole slipped away and returned with a pencil and a few half sheets of paper, which he placed on the table at his friend’s elbow. “It’s quite a long time since you did any poetry,” he remarked. “You might have a try at it this evening, instead of—well, brooding over things so much. I’ve an idea that you’ll feel a lot better when you’ve got something jotted down—if it’s only just the rhymes.” The Rat pushed the paper away from him wearily, but the discreet Mole took occasion to leave the room, and when he peeped in again some time later, the Rat was absorbed and deaf to the world; alternately scribbling and sucking the top of his pencil. It is true that he sucked a good deal more than he scribbled; but it was joy to the Mole to know that the cure had at least begun.",1229.0

“Smiley he stood scratching his head and looking down at Dan’l a long time, and at last says, ‘I do wonder what in the nation that frog throwed off for—I wonder if there ain’t something the matter with him—he ’pears to look mighty baggy, somehow.’
“And he ketched Dan’l up by the nap of the neck, and hefted him, and says, ‘Why blame my cats if he don’t weigh five pounds!’ and turned him upside down and he belched out a double handful of shot. And then he see how it was, and he was the maddest man—he set the frog down and took out after that feller, but he never ketched him. And—” (Here Simon Wheeler heard his name called from the front yard, and got up to see what was wanted.) And turning to me as he moved away, he said: “Just set where you are, stranger, and rest easy—I ain’t going to be gone a second.” But, by your leave, I did not think that a continuation of the history of the enterprising vagabond Jim Smiley would be likely to afford me much information concerning the Rev. Leonidas W. Smiley, and so I started away. At the door I met the sociable Wheeler returning, and he buttonholed me and recommenced: “Well, this-yer Smiley had a yaller, one-eyed cow that didn’t have no tail, only jest a short stump like a bannanner, and—” However, lacking both time and inclination, I did not wait to hear about the afflicted cow, but took my leave.",1288.0
" Some advocates for labels on GMO foods are working to get new laws passed that require labeling in the individual states where they live. So far, most of those efforts have been unsuccessful. In 2014, Vermont became the first state to require labels on GMO foods sold within its boundaries. Some businesses across the country, such as specialty grocery stores, have also pledged to label any GMO foods they sell.
People who want widespread labeling for GMO foods face considerable opposition. The companies that develop, grow, and market genetically modified foods say that requiring GMO labels on their products will unfairly hurt their business. Advocates for the GMO industry argue that the negative perceptions about GMO foods are based in controversy, not information, and that labels won’t help educate the public with the facts about GMOs. Some argue that due to public fears about the risks of GMO foods, any label that says “GMO” will automatically keep people from buying a product—whether that product is good or bad. Many industry insiders fear that mandatory labels will lump all GMO products into one category, regardless of how and why each product is manufactured and which GMO ingredients are used. Industry advocates warn that labels will only promote more fear, resulting in decreased funding and support to develop new GMO products that might benefit people in the future. Finally, they say that labeling every product will be expensive and complicated, especially if different states or stores each have their own laws requiring labeling.
